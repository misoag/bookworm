<p><b>7 农场主伯德伍德求婚 </b></p>
<p>On Saturday at Casterbridge market Boldwood saw the woman who was disturbing his dreams. For the first time he turned his head and looked at her. It was in fact the first time in his life that he had looked at any woman. Up to now he had considered women to be distant，almost foreign creatures who had nothing to do with him. Now he saw Bathsheba's hair，and every detail of her face. He noticed her figure，her dress，and even her feet. She seemed very beauti-ful to him，and his heart began to move within him. ‘And this woman，this lovely young woman，has asked me to marry her！’he thought. As he was watching Bathsheba selling wheat to another farmer，he was filled with jealousy.</p>
<p>星期六，在卡斯特桥的集市上，伯德伍德看到了那个搅乱了他的梦的女人。第一次他扭过头来看她。实际上，这是他有生以来头一次盯着看女人。到目前为止，他一直都把女人当作是遥远的，甚至是陌生的、与他无关的生物。现在，他看到了芭丝谢芭的头发，看到了她脸上的每一处。他注意到了她的身材、她的穿着，甚至她的脚。在他看来她似乎是很美的，他的心开始跳动。“这个女人，这个漂亮、年轻的女人要我和他结婚！”他心想。当他看到芭丝谢芭把麦子卖给另一个农场主时，内心充满嫉妒。</p>
<p>All this time Bathsheba was aware of his eyes on her. At last she had made him look at her！But she would have pre－ferred him to admire her from the beginning，without the en- couragement of her valentine. She felt sorry she had disturbed the usual calmness of a man she respected，but considered she could not apologize to him without either offending or encour-aging him.</p>
<p>芭丝谢芭知道伯德伍德的眼睛一直在盯着自己。她终于使他开始看她了！不过，她更希望他从一开始就喜欢她，而不是由于情人卡的作用。她打扰了一个为她所尊敬的人的一惯的安宁，她为此感到内疚，可又觉得不能向他道歉，否则，要么会惹恼他，要么便会使他得到鼓励。</p>
<p>Mr Boldwood did not try to speak to her，and returned home to his farm. He was a man of strong feelings，which normally lay hidden deep inside him. Because he was serious，and did not joke with his neighbours，people thought he was cold But when he loved or hated，it was with his whole heart. If Bathsheba had known how strong the feelings of this dark and silent figure were，she would have blamed herself terribly for her thoughtlessness. But nobody guessed what lay behind his calm appearance.</p>
<p>伯德伍德先生没有和她说话，他回到了农场的家里。他是一个感情强烈的人，他的情感通常都深深地埋在心底。他严肃，不和邻居们开玩笑，所以人们都觉得他很冷漠。可他爱谁或是恨谁时，却是全心全意的。如果芭丝谢芭知道这个黝黑、沉静的人的感情是多么强烈的话，她一定会为自己的不慎重而自责不已。不过，谁也不知道在他沉静的外表后面藏着什么。</p>
<p>A few days later Mr Boldwood was looking at Bathsheba's fields，which were next to his own，when he saw her helping Gabriel Oak with the sheep. To Boldwood，Bathsheba shone like the moon on a dark night. His heart，which had never been touched before，was filled completely with his love for her. He decided to go and speak to her.</p>
<p>几天后，伯德伍德先生望着与他的地挨着的芭丝谢芭的田地，他看见她在帮着盖伯瑞尔&middot;奥克照料羊群。伯德伍德觉得芭丝谢芭象黑夜的月亮发着光。他的那颗从不为什么所动的心充满了对她的爱意。他决定去对她表明心声。</p>
<p>As he stopped at the gate of the field，Bathsheba looked up and noticed him. Gabriel was watching her face and saw her blush. He immediately thought of the envelope，with the valentine，that Boldwood had shown him，and suspected Bathsheba of encouraging the farmer to fall in love with her.</p>
<p>他在田地的大门口停住了脚，这时芭丝谢芭抬起头来，注意到了她。盖伯瑞尔看着她，发现她红了脸。他立刻想到伯德伍德给他看的那个装着情人卡的信封，估计是芭丝谢芭引得这位农场主爱上了她。</p>
<p>Boldwood realized they had noticed him，and suddenly felt unsure of himself. He did not know enough about women to discover from Bathsheba's manner whether she wanted to see him or not. And so he did not enter the field，but walked on， past the gate.</p>
<p>伯德伍德意识到他们在注意自己，他突然感到没有信心。他不很了解女人，所以无法从芭丝谢芭的态度上弄清她是否愿意见他。所以他没有进地里去，而是一直走过了大门。</p>
<p>Bathsheba，however，knew that he had come to see her， and felt extremely guilty. She promised herself never again to disturb the peace of this man's life. Unfortunately her promise was made too late，as such promises often are.</p>
<p>芭丝谢芭知道他是来看她的，心里感到很不安。她向自己保证决不再打扰这个人平静的生活了。不幸的是，她的保证太晚了，这种保证常常会这样。</p>
<p>It was not until the end of May that Boldwood was brave enough to declare his love. He went to Bathsheba's house，where the maids told him their mistress was watching the sheep－washing. Every spring the sheep were washed in a spe－ cial pool，to keep their wool clean and to get rid of insects on their skin. Boldwood walked across the fields to the pool， where he found the farm workers busily washing the sheep.</p>
<p>直到五月底，伯德伍德才鼓起勇气宣布了他的爱情。他来到芭丝谢芭的家，女仆告诉他女主人去看给羊洗澡了。每年春天都在一个特别的池子里给羊洗澡，这样可以清洁羊毛，也可去除羊身上的寄生虫。伯德伍德穿过田地走向池塘，他发现农场工人们都在那里忙着给羊洗澡。</p>
<p>Bathsheba was standing near them，and saw Boldwood com- ing towards her. She moved away，walking beside the river， but she could hear footsteps behind her in the grass，and felt love all around her，like perfume in the air Boldwood caught up with her.</p>
<p>芭丝谢芭站在他们跟前，她看到伯德伍德向她走来。她走开了，沿着河边走去，她能听到身后草里的脚步声。她感到她的四周弥漫着爱意，象空气中的香味。伯德伍德追上了她。</p>
<p>‘Miss Everdene！’he said quietly.</p>
<p>“伊芙丁小姐！”他轻声叫道。</p>
<p>She trembled，turned，and said，‘Good morning. ’She had guessed the truth from the way he spoke those two words.</p>
<p>她颤抖了，转身说，“早晨好。”她从他说话的声音已猜出了他的来意。</p>
<p>‘I feel—almost too much to think， ’he said simply. ‘My life does not belong to me any more，Miss Everdene，but to you. I've come to propose marriage to you. ’</p>
<p>“我想得太多了，都想不清了，”他直截了当地说，“伊芙丁小姐，我的生活不再属于我，而是属于你。我是来向你求婚的。”</p>
<p>Bathsheba tried not to show any expression on her face.</p>
<p>芭丝谢芭努力地不使感情在脸上表现出来。</p>
<p>‘I'm now forty-one，’he continued. ‘I've never married，or thought I ever would marry. But we all change，and I changed when I saw you. More than anything else，I want you as my wife. ’ ‘I think，Mr Boldwood，that although I respect you very much，I don't feel—enough for you—to accept your proposal. ’</p>
<p>“我41岁，”他接着说。“从未结过婚，甚至从未想过会结婚。但人都是变化的，我见到你时，我变了。我现在最迫切需要的就是要你做我的妻子。”“伯德伍德先生，我觉得尽管我非常尊敬您，但这并不足以让我接受你的求婚。”</p>
<p>‘But my life is worthless without you！’he cried，calm no longer. ‘I want you-to let me say I love you，again and again！’Bathsheba remained silent. ‘I think and hope you care enough for me to listen to what I have to say！’he added.</p>
<p>“没有你我的生活将毫无意义！”他嚷道，有些沉不住气了。“希望你允许我一遍遍地说我爱你！”芭丝谢芭沉默不语。“我希望你能把我当回事，听我说说我的心里话。”他又说道。</p>
<p>Bathsheba was about to ask why he should think that，when she remembered the valentine After all，it was quite natural for him to think she admired him.</p>
<p>芭丝谢芭正准备问他怎么会这样想时，突然记起了那张情人卡。这样，伯德伍德认为芭丝谢芭喜欢他是很自然的。</p>
<p>‘I wish I could court you with beautiful words，’the farmer went on，‘but I can only say I love you madly and want you for my wife. I wouldn't have proposed if you hadn't allowed me to hope. ’</p>
<p>“我希望我能用漂亮的言词追求你，”农场主继续说，“但我只能说我发疯地爱着你，而且想要你做我的妻子。要不是你燃起了我的希望，我是不会求婚的。”</p>
<p>‘Mr Boldwood，this is difficult for me！I'm afraid I can't marry you. I'm not in love with you！I should never have sent that valentine—forgive me—it was a thoughtless thing to do. ’</p>
<p>“伯德伍德先生，这对我太难了！恐怕我不能和你结婚。我并不爱你！我不该寄那张情人卡——请原谅——那样做是欠考虑的。”</p>
<p>‘No，no，don't say it was thoughtless！Say it was the beginning of a feeling that you would like me. Just consider whether you can accept me as a husband. I know I'm too old for you，but believe me， I'll take more care of you than a younger man would. You'll have nothing to worry about. You'll have everything you want. God only knows how much you mean to me！’</p>
<p>“不，不，别说那件事是欠考虑的！说它是你喜欢我的开始。考虑一下你是否愿意我做你的丈夫。我明白对你来说我有点太老了，可是相信我，我会比年轻的人照顾得你更好。你没有需要操心的事。你会拥有你需要的一切！只有天知道你对我意味着什么！”</p>
<p>Bathsheba's young heart was full of pity for this sensitive man who had spoken so simply and honestly.</p>
<p>芭丝谢芭那颗年轻的心对这个敏感的人充满了怜悯，他讲得如此的直率和诚恳。</p>
<p>‘Don't say it，don't！You feel so much，and I feel nothing，’she replied. ‘Don't discuss it any more. I can't think！Oh，I've given you such pain！’</p>
<p>“别这么说，别这么说！你的感情如此强烈，而我却什么都不觉得，”她回答说。“别再说这个了，我无法考虑！唉，我使你这么痛苦！”</p>
<p>‘Tell me that you don't refuse completely. Give me some hope！May I ask you again？May I think of you？’</p>
<p>“告诉我你并没有完全拒绝我。给我一线希望！我可以再求婚吗？我可以想你吗？”</p>
<p>‘Yes，I suppose so. ’</p>
<p>“可以，我想可以。”</p>
<p>‘May I hope you will accept my proposal next time？’</p>
<p>“我可以希望你下次会接受我的求婚吗？”</p>
<p>‘No，don't hope！I must go now. Give me time to think. ’</p>
<p>“不，别抱希望！我现在得走了。给我时间让我想想。”</p>
<p>‘Yes，I'll give you time，’he answered gratefully. ‘Thank you，I'm happier now. ’</p>
<p>“行，我给你时间，”他感激地说。“谢谢你，现在我高兴了。”</p>
<p>‘No，please，don't be happier，Mr Boldwood，if happiness only comes from my agreeing！I must think. ’</p>
<p>“请别这样，伯德伍德先生，要是仅仅因为我同意，你就觉得那么高兴，那你就先别高兴！我必须考虑考虑。”</p>
<p>‘I'll wait，’he agreed. They turned away from each other， and returned to their separate houses.</p>
<p>“我可以等，”他同意了。他们分手，各自回到自己的家里。</p><a href='8.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
