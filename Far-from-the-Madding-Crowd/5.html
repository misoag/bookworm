<p><b>5 芭丝谢芭寄出一张情人卡 </b></p>
<p>When Bathsheba first appeared at the weekly Caster－ bridge market，where farmers bought and sold their wheat and animals，she caused a sensation. Men's heads turned to look at her，the only woman there. Like any woman，she was happy to be admired，but she was also deter- mined to sell her wheat at a good price，and to do business with the other farmers like a man. There was one farmer， however，who did not seem to notice her，and this annoyed her a little. It was Mr Boldwood.</p>
<p>在每周一次的卡斯特桥集市上，农场主们买卖着自己的麦子和牲畜。芭丝谢芭第一次出现在集市上就引起了一阵轰动。男人们的头都扭过去看她，因为她是集市上唯一的女人。象所有的女人一样，受到别人的赞扬，她很高兴。不过，她也决心要把她的麦子卖个好价钱，象男人一样地和其他农场主做买卖。只有一个农场主似乎没注意到她，这使她有点不高兴。这人就是伯德伍德先生。</p>
<p>One Sunday afternoon，on the thirteenth of February，Bathsheba and Liddy were in the sitting－room together. It was a dull，cold day，and they were both very bored.</p>
<p>2月13日，这个星期日的下午，芭丝谢芭和利蒂都在起居室。天气阴沉、寒冷，她们两人都觉得很无聊。</p>
<p>‘Have you ever tried to discover who you're going to marry，miss，’asked Liddy，‘with a Bible and a key？’</p>
<p>“小姐，你试没试过用一本圣经或是一把钥匙算出你将与谁结婚？”利蒂问。</p>
<p>‘I don't believe in such foolish games，Liddy. ’</p>
<p>“利蒂，我不相信这种愚蠢的游戏。”</p>
<p>‘Well，some people believe it works. ’</p>
<p>“可是有人觉得它很灵验。”</p>
<p>‘All right，let's try it，’said Bathsheba suddenly，jumping up from her seat. Together they opened the big family Bible and put a key on a page.</p>
<p>“好吧，那我们试试，”芭丝谢芭一边从座位上跳起来，一边突然说。她们一起打开一本大的家里用的圣经，把一把钥匙放在一页上。</p>
<p>‘Now you think of someone you could marry，miss，’said Liddy，‘then read aloud the words on that page，and if the Bible moves，perhaps you'll marry him. ’</p>
<p>“小姐，现在你想一个你可能与之结婚的人，”利蒂说，“然后朗读那页上的话，如果圣经动了，也许你就会和他结婚。”</p>
<p>Bathsheba read the words，holding the Bible. As they watched，the Bible turned in her hands，and Bathsheba blushed.</p>
<p>芭丝谢芭拿着圣经，读上面的话。她们盯着看时，圣经在她手中动了一下，芭丝谢芭红了脸。</p>
<p>‘Who were you thinking of？’asked Liddy curiously.</p>
<p>“你刚才想的是谁？”利蒂好奇地问。</p>
<p>‘I'm not going to tell you，’answered her mistress.</p>
<p>“我不告诉你，”她的女主人说。</p>
<p>‘By the way，did you notice Mr Boldwood in church this morning？’asked Liddy，making it very clear who she was thinking of. ‘He didn't turn his head once to look at you！’</p>
<p>“哎，今天早晨在教堂你注意伯德伍德先生了吗？”利蒂问，指明她想的是谁。“他一次也没有回头看你！”</p>
<p>‘Why should he？’replied Bathsheba，annoyed. ‘I didn't ask him to look at me. ’</p>
<p>“他干吗要回头看我？”芭丝谢芭不高兴地说。“我并没有要求他看我。”</p>
<p>‘Oh no. But everybody else in church was looking at you. ’</p>
<p>“噢，不。我是说教堂里的其他人都在看你。”</p>
<p>Bathsheba did not reply to this. After a few minutes she said，‘Oh，I nearly forgot the valentine card I bought yester－ day！’</p>
<p>芭丝谢芭没有吭声。过了一会儿，她说，“哎呀，我差点忘了昨天买的情人卡！”</p>
<p>‘A valentine！Who's it for，miss？Farmer Boldwood？’</p>
<p>“情人卡！给谁的，小姐？给农场主伯德伍德？”</p>
<p>‘No，of course not. It's for one of the village children，that sweet little boy of Jan Coggan's. I'll write the address on the envelope now，and we'll post it today. ’</p>
<p>“不，当然不是。是给村里的一个孩子的，就是简&middot;考根家那个可爱的男孩。我现在就把地址写在信封上，我们今天就把它发出去。”</p>
<p>‘What fun it would be to send it to that silly old Bold－ wood！’laughed Liddy.</p>
<p>“要是把它送给那个傻乎乎的老伯德伍德该多有意思！”利蒂大笑着说。</p>
<p>Bathsheba paused to consider. It was certainly a little de－ pressing that the wealthiest and most important man in the area did not seem to admire her，as all the other men did.</p>
<p>芭丝谢芭不再说话，若有所思。其他人都很欣赏她，而这一带最富有、最重要的人却好像对她不在乎，这的确有点令人沮丧。</p>
<p>‘We'll throw a coin to decide，’she said lightly. ‘No，we shouldn't play with money on a Sunday. I know，we'll throw this book. If it comes down open，I'll send the valentine to Jan's son. If it comes down shut，I'll send it to Boldwood. ’ The little book went up in the air and came down shut. Bathsheba immediately picked up her pen and wrote Bold-wood's address on the envelope.</p>
<p>“我们来扔硬币决定，”她随意地说。“不，星期天我们不该玩钱。我们来扔这本书。如果它开着掉下来，我就把情人卡送给简的儿子。如果合着掉下来，就送给伯德伍德。”那本小书被抛向空中，合着掉了下来。芭丝谢芭立刻拿起笔，在信封上写了伯德伍德的地址。</p>
<p>‘Now we need a seal，’she said. ‘Look for an interesting one，Liddy. Ah，let's use this one. I can't remember what it says，but I know it's funny. ’When she had sealed the enve－lope，Bathsheba looked closely at the words left by the seal：</p>
<p>“我们需要一个封蜡，”她说，“利蒂，找一个有意思的。噢，我们用这个。我不记得上面是什么字了，可我知道很有意思。”把信封封上后，芭丝谢芭仔细地看着封蜡留下的字：</p>
<p>‘MARRY ME’.</p>
<p>“和我结婚吧。”</p>
<p>‘Just right！’she cried. ‘That would make even a vicar laugh！’And so the valentine was sent，not for love，but as a joke. Bathsheba had no idea of the effect it would have.</p>
<p>“就要这个！”她喊道。“这把牧师也会逗笑的！”就这样，情人卡被发出去了，不是为了爱情，而是做为玩笑。芭丝谢芭根本不知道它会引起的后果。</p>
<p>It arrived at Mr Boldwood's house on the morning of St Valentine's Day，14th February He was puzzled，but strangely excited by it He had never received one before，and all day he thought about it. Who could the woman be who admired him so much that she sent him a valentine？He kept on looking at it，until the words on the large red seal danced in front of his tired eyes，and he could no longer read them. But he knew what they said：</p>
<p>情人卡在2月14日，情人节的这天早晨到了伯德伍德家里。他很困惑，但也有一种莫名的激动。从前他从没有收到过情人卡，他一整天都在想这件事。这个女人会是谁呢，这样的喜欢他，还送他情人卡？他一直盯着这张情人卡，直到那大红封蜡上的字在他疲惫的眼前跳动了起来。他无法看清这几个字，但他知道是什么：</p>
<p>‘MARRY ME’.</p>
<p>“和我结婚吧。”</p>
<p>The valentine had destroyed the peaceful routine of Bold－wood's life. That night he dreamed of the unknown woman，and when he woke up very early，the first thing he saw was the valentine，with its message in red，on the table by his bed.</p>
<p>这张情人卡打破了伯德伍德平静的生活程序。那天夜里，他梦见了一个素不相识的女人。他醒得很早，一眼就看到床边桌子上那张情人卡，和红色封蜡上面的字。</p>
<p>‘Marry me，’he repeated to himself. He was too restless to sleep any more so he went out for a walk. He watched the sun rise over the snowy fields，and on his way home he met the postman，who handed him a letter. Boldwood took it quickly and opened it，thinking it could be from the sender of the valentine.</p>
<p>“和我结婚吧，”他默默地重复着。他烦燥不安无法成眠，所以出去散步。他看着太阳在白雪覆盖的田野上升起。在回家的路上，他碰见了邮递员，邮递员给了他一封信。他立刻接住并打开了信，以为是寄情人卡的人写来的信。</p>
<p>‘I don't think it's for you，sir，’said the postman. ‘I think it's for your shepherd. ’</p>
<p>“先生，我想信不是寄给你的，”邮递员说，“是给你的牧羊人的。”</p>
<p>Boldwood looked at the address on the envelope：</p>
<p>伯德伍德看着信封上的地址：</p>
<p>To the new shepherd，</p>
<p>给新来的牧羊人，</p>
<p>Weatherbury Farm，</p>
<p>威瑟伯里农场，</p>
<p>Near Casterbridge.</p>
<p>卡斯特桥附近。</p>
<p>‘Oh，what a mistake！It isn't mine，or my shepherd's. It must be for Miss Everdene's shepherd. His name is Gabriel Oak. ’</p>
<p>“哎，错了！不是我的，也不是给我的牧羊人的。一定是给伊芙丁小姐的牧羊人的。他叫盖伯瑞尔&middot;奥克。”</p>
<p>At that moment he noticed a figure in a distant field.</p>
<p>这时，他注意到远处有一个人影。</p>
<p>‘Ah，there he is now，’Boldwood added. ‘I'll take the let－ ter to him myself. ’The shepherd started walking towards the malthouse，and Boldwood followed him，holding the letter.</p>
<p>“欧，他就在那儿，”伯德伍德接着说。“我自己给他把信送去。”牧羊人向着酒店走去，伯德伍德手里拿着信，追他去了。</p><a href='6.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
