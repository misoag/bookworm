<p><b>17 农场主伯德伍德开始盼望 </b></p>
<p>When Troy did not return，Bathsheba felt neither happiness nor sadness. She had no hope for the fu-ture. She was sure that one day he would return，and spend the rest of her money. Then they would have to sell the farm. She could do nothing to prevent it.</p>
<p>托伊出而不归，芭丝谢芭既不觉得高兴，也不感到伤心，她对将来没有什么期望。她确信他总有一天要回来，接着花她的钱。到了那时，他们只得把农场卖掉，她无法避免此事发生。</p>
<p>One Saturday at Casterbridge market，a stranger came up to her. ‘I must tell you，ma'am，’he said，‘your husband is dead. ’</p>
<p>一个星期六，她正在卡斯特桥市场，一个陌生人向她走来。“我得告诉你，太太，”他说，“你丈夫死了。”</p>
<p>‘No，it can't be true！’gasped Bathsheba. Darkness came over her eyes，and she fell. But not to the ground. Boldwood，who had been standing in a corner watching her，ran forward to catch her.</p>
<p>“没有，不可能！”芭丝谢芭气吁吁地说。她眼前一黑，向前倒下，但没有倒在地上。原来伯德伍德一直站在一个拐角看着她，此时跑上前来扶住了她。</p>
<p>‘Tell me more，’he said to the stranger，as he held the unconscious girl gently in his arms.</p>
<p>“还有什么消息告诉我。”他对那陌生人说，一边用双手把失去知觉的姑娘轻轻揽祝</p>
<p>‘The police found her husband's clothes on the beach. He must have been swimming，and drowned off the Budmouth coast. ’</p>
<p>“警察在海滩上发现了她丈夫的衣服，他准是在巴德茅斯岸边游泳时淹死了。”</p>
<p>There was a strange excitement in Boldwood's face，but he said nothing. He carried her to a private room at the hotel，where she could rest until she felt well enough to ride home.</p>
<p>伯德伍德脸上出现一丝不可思议的激动，但他什么也没有说。他把她抱到旅店的一间僻静房间，让她在那里休息，直至她能够骑马回家。</p>
<p>When she arrived home，still feeling weak and confused，Liddy had already heard the news. ‘Shall we get some black clothes made for you，ma'am？’said the maid，hesitating a little.</p>
<p>她到家时，仍觉得虚弱与惶惑，利蒂已经听说了。“咱们给你定做黑衣服吧，太太？”她有点犹豫地说。</p>
<p>‘No，Liddy. It isn't necessary. You see，I think he may still be alive. I feel—I think I'm sure he's alive！’</p>
<p>“不用，利蒂。没必要。你知道吧，我觉得他可能还活着。我感觉——我想我可以确信他还活着！”</p>
<p>But the following Monday Troy's death was reported in the local newspaper. A witness had seen him in deep water，shouting and waving for help. And when his clothes and his watch，found on the beach，were delivered to the farmhouse，Bathsheba began to doubt that he was alive. She opened the back of his watch case and took out the curl of golden hair.</p>
<p>但是，到星期一，当地报纸上报道了托伊的死讯，一个目击者曾看到他在深水中呼喊并挥手求救。人们把在海滩上发现的衣服和表送到农场时，芭丝谢芭开始怀疑他是否还活着。她把表的后盖打开，把那一绺金发取了出来。</p>
<p>‘He was Fanny's and she was his，’she said to herself. ‘They should be together. I mean nothing to either of them. Why should I keep her hair？’She held the curl over the fire. ‘No，I won't burn it，I'll keep it in memory of her，poor thing！’</p>
<p>“他属于范妮，范妮也属于他，”她自语道。“他们应当在一起的。对于他俩来说，我什么都不是。我干吗保留她的头发？”她把那绺头发举到火上。“不行，不能烧掉。我得留着纪念她，可怜的东西！”</p>
<p>Through the autumn and winter Bathsheba's life was more peaceful She no longer took such an interest in the farm，and very sensibly appointed Gabriel Oak her farm manager. He had already been doing the job unofficially，and now would be paid for it. At last his good qualities were being recognized. Gabriel's luck had certainly changed. Boldwood could not concentrate on farming these days either. His wheat and hay had all been so damaged by the rain that it was worthless. Weatherbury people were shocked by the changes they had no-ticed recently in Farmer Boldwood. Soon he himself realized that something must be done，and arranged for Gabriel to manage his farm too. So Gabriel was responsible for both the important farms in the area，while their owners sat alone in their lonely farmhouses.</p>
<p>整个秋天至冬天，芭丝谢芭的生活都较以前平静。她已不很关心农事，因为她的农场经理人盖伯瑞尔&middot;奥克把农场经营得井井有条。他早已干起了经理人的工作，而且即将拿经理人的工资。他的好品质终于得到承认，他时来运转了。这些日子，伯德伍德的心思也集中不到农事上头。他的麦子和干草遭受大雨破坏，已经不中用了。威瑟伯里的人们对农场主伯德伍德身上发生的变化都感到震惊。很快，他自己也意识到必须采取措施了，于是他让盖伯瑞尔来替他经营农常就这样，盖伯瑞尔经管起了这一带的两个大农场，而农场的主人们则在他们的农舍里独自端坐着。</p>
<p>After a time Boldwood started to hope that one day，if Bathsheba remarried at all，she would marry him. He tried to maintain a friendly，businesslike relationship with her，keeping his love for her out of sight，until the right moment came to propose again. He had no idea how long he would have to wait to marry her，but he was prepared to wait for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>过了一段时间，伯德伍德开始希望有那么一天芭丝谢芭如果再婚，嫁的人会是他。他努力与她保持一种公事公办式的友好关系，而把自己对她的爱意掩藏起来，直至等到求婚的好时机再次到来。他不清楚要等多久才能娶她为妻，但是，他已经准备等候终生了。</p>
<p>The right moment did not come until the following summer when most of the Weatherbury people attended the great sheep fair at. Greenhill. Gabriel was there with Bathsheba's and Boldwood's sheep，and so were both his employers. This year a travelling circus put up its tent and offered the public a horse-riding show. Most of Bathsheba's farm workers were already in the tent，when Bathsheba herself arrived to see the show. At the back of the tent，behind a curtain，were the circus riders，and one of them，pulling on his boots，was Sergeant Troy.</p>
<p>直至第二年夏天威瑟伯里的大部分人都到格林希尔参加盛大的绵羊集市，好时机才姗姗来到。盖伯瑞尔带着芭丝谢芭和伯德伍德的羊到了集市上，他的两位雇主也来了。这一年，一个流动马戏团支起了帐篷给人们表演跑马节目。芭丝谢芭所雇的工人差不多都已进了帐篷，芭丝谢芭才赶来。在帐篷后部的幕布背后，站着马戏团的骑手，其中一个正在穿靴子的，正是托伊中士。</p>
<p>After being rescued，Troy had decided to stay on the ship and work as a sailor，but he was not happy with this travelling life，and finally returned to England. He hesitated to go back to Bathsheba and a comfortable life on the farm. Perhaps Bathsheba would fail at farming and then he would be respon-sible for her. And anyway，perhaps she would not welcome him back. For the moment he was working as actor and horse-rider with the circus. So it was with no plans for the future that Troy found himself at Greenhill fair，dangerously close to Weatherbury.</p>
<p>托伊被救以后，决定留在船上当个水手，但他又不愿过那种漂泊的生活，于是最终返回了英格兰。对于回不回芭丝谢芭身边过那种舒适的农家生活，他很是犹豫，也许芭丝谢芭务不了农，那么他还得负责养她。无论怎样，芭丝谢芭都不会欢迎他回去的。眼下，他在这家马戏团当演员跑马。就这样，在对未来一无所知的情况下，托伊来到了格林希尔集市，处于距离威瑟伯里很近的危险境地。</p>
<p>When he looked through a hole in the curtain to see the audience，he was horrified to see his wife. She looked more beautiful than he remembered. Perhaps she would laugh at him，a nobleman's son，working in a circus！As he rode into the tent，he was careful to keep his face away from her，and remain wrapped in his cloak. She did not seem to recognize him.</p>
<p>他从幕布上的一个洞向外面的观众看了一眼，却看到了他的妻子，令他颇感惊恐。比他记忆中的她更漂亮了。她如果看到他这个贵族人家的儿子在马戏团工作，定会嘲笑他的！他骑马进入帐篷时，裹着斗篷，小心地把自己的脸避开她，她似乎并没有认出他来。</p>
<p>When the show was over，Troy went out into the darkness. In the large tent where meals and drinks were being served，he saw Bathsheba talking to a man. Was she forgetting her husband so soon？thought Troy angrily. He decided to listen to their conversation，and knelt down outside the tent，making a little hole with his knife in the heavy cotton so that he could see the two people inside.</p>
<p>节目结束后，托伊到了暗处。在大帐篷里供应饭食饮料处，他看到芭丝谢芭在和一个男人交谈。她这么快就把丈夫忘了？托伊气愤地想。他决定听一听他们在说些什么，于是在帐篷外面跪了下来，用小刀在厚布上面割了个小洞，他便可以看到帐篷里的人了。</p>
<p>She was drinking a cup of tea，which Boldwood had just brought her. Troy watched her every movement. She was as handsome as ever，and she belonged to him. After a few moments Troy got up and walked slowly from the tent. He was considering what to do next.</p>
<p>她正在喝茶，茶是伯德伍德刚给她端来的。托伊注视着她的一举一动。她还像以往那样好看，她属于他。过了一会儿，托伊站起身来离开帐篷。他正在考虑下一步该干什么。</p>
<p>Meanwhile Boldwood had offered to ride back to Weather-bury with Bathsheba，as it was getting late，and she accepted. Her pity for the man she had hurt so deeply made her behave more kindly towards him than was perhaps sensible. Her kind-ness made poor Boldwood dream of their future marriage，and suddenly，unable to stop himself，he said，‘Mrs Troy，will you marry again some day？’</p>
<p>此时，伯德伍德提议与芭丝谢芭一道骑马回威瑟伯里，因为天已近黑。芭丝谢芭同意了。她曾深深伤害过这个男人，因而对他怀有怜悯，于是她对他的言谈话语十分和气，或许有些有失分寸。她的和气使可怜的伯德伍德幻想起他们二人将来结婚的事。突然间他不能自制，说道，“托伊夫人，你会再婚吗？”</p>
<p>‘You forget that my husband's death has never been proved，so I may not really be a widow，’she said，confused. ‘I've a feeling he's alive，and I'm not thinking of marrying anyone else. ’</p>
<p>“你忘了吧，我丈夫的死从未得到证实，所以，我可能还不是寡妇呢，”她迷茫地说。“我有一种感觉，他还活着。所以我还没有考虑嫁给任何人。”</p>
<p>‘Do you know，Bathsheba，that according to the lawyers，you can remarry seven years after your husband's supposed death，that is，six years from now？Could you—promise to marry me then？’</p>
<p>“你知道，芭丝谢芭，依据法律，假定你的丈夫已死，那么七年之后你便可以再婚，也就是说从现在起六年以后。能不能——答应到时候嫁给我？”</p>
<p>‘I don't know. Six years is too far away. I'm bitterly sorry I behaved so stupidly towards you，but—I can promise I'll never marry another man while you want me to be your wife，but—’</p>
<p>“我不知道，六年的时间太长了。我十分后悔那样愚蠢地对待你，可是——我可以保证只要你还想让我做你的妻子，我就决不嫁给他人，可是——”</p>
<p>‘You could put right the mistake you made by promising to be my wife in six years’time！’There was wild hope in his eyes.</p>
<p>“你可以用保证六年以后做我的妻子来改正你所犯的错误！”他的双眼里显现出急切的希望。</p>
<p>‘Oh，what shall I do？I don't love you，but if I can give you happiness by just promising，then I will—consider—and promise—soon. Shall we say，by Christmas？’</p>
<p>“唉，我怎么办呢？我又不爱你，不过如果我保证一下就能让你幸福，那我愿意——考虑——尽快对你作出保证。到圣诞节前，怎样？”</p>
<p>‘You'll promise at Christmas. Well，I'll say no more. ’</p>
<p>“你要在圣诞节作出保证，好吧，那我就不再说什么了。”</p>
<p>As Christmas came nearer，Bathsheba became more anxious，and one day she confessed her difficulty to Gabriel.</p>
<p>随着圣诞节临近，芭丝谢芭更加忧虑起来，于是有一天，她向盖伯瑞尔坦露了她的难处。</p>
<p>‘The saddest reason of all for agreeing to his proposal，’she said，‘is that if I don't，I'm afraid he'll go mad. His feelings are so extreme. I don't say that because I'm vain，but I believe I hold that man's future in my hands. Oh Gabriel，it's a terrible worry！’</p>
<p>“我接受他求婚，最让我伤心的原因就是，”她说，“如果我不接受，那他就有可能发疯。他的感情太过狂热。我这样说并不是因为我自负，而是因为，这个人的未来掌握在我的手中。盖伯瑞尔，这事可真让人揪心哪！”</p>
<p>‘Then why don't you promise，ma'am？I don't think people would think it wrong. The only thing that makes it wrong in my view is that you don't love him. ’</p>
<p>“那你为什么不答应他呢，太太？我想人们不会觉得这有什么错的。我觉得这件事情唯一不合适的一点就是你并不爱他。”</p>
<p>‘That is my punishment，Gabriel，for playing that foolish trick with the valentine on him. ’Gabriel had given her a reasonable，sensible answer，as she knew he would，but she felt annoyed with his cool advice. Not once had he spoken of his love for her，or said that he could wait for her too. She would have refused him of course，but at least it would have shown that he still admired her.</p>
<p>“这是对我的惩罚，盖伯瑞尔，因为我在情人节跟他开了那种愚蠢的玩笑。”盖伯瑞尔给了她一个合情合理的回答，她知道也会如此。但是，他这种冷静的忠告令她感到恼火。他不只一次地对她谈及他的爱，还说过他也可以等她。当然她也会拒绝他的，不过，至少那样会表明他仍然爱慕她。</p><a href='18.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
