<p><b>18 伯德伍德先生举办圣诞宴会 </b></p>
<p>For months Weatherbury people had been discussing the party that Mr Boldwood was going to give just before Christmas，and now the day had finally arrived. Bathsheba was getting ready for it.</p>
<p>几个月来，威瑟伯里的人们一直在谈论伯德伍德先生将在圣诞节之前举行的宴会，现在这一天终于来到了。芭丝谢芭正为赴宴作准备。</p>
<p>‘I'm upset，Liddy，it's foolish of me，I know，’she said. ‘I wish I didn't have to go to the party. I haven't spoken to Mr Boldwood since the autumn，when I promised to see him at Christmas，so I'll have to go. My black silk dress，please. ’</p>
<p>“我挺心烦的，利蒂。我真蠢，我知道，”她说。“真希望我能不去。去年秋天我答应圣诞节去见他，从那以后我就没和他说过什么话，所以，我是得去。请给我穿上黑绸裙子。”</p>
<p>‘Surely you don't need to wear black tonight，ma'am？You've been a widow for fourteen months now. That's a long time. ’</p>
<p>“你今晚用不着穿黑吧，太太？你守寡已经14个月了，时间够长的了。”</p>
<p>‘No，if I wear a bright dress，people will say I'm encouraging Mr Boldwood. How do I look，Liddy？’</p>
<p>“不行，我要是穿上鲜亮衣裙，人们会说我在鼓励伯德伍德先生。你看我怎么样？”</p>
<p>‘I've hardly ever seen you look so lovely，ma'am. ’</p>
<p>“我还没怎么见过你这么漂亮呢，太太。”</p>
<p>‘I rish offending him if I don't go. Oh，I wish I could have continued as I've been for the last year or so，with no hopes or fears，and no pleasures and no sadness. ’</p>
<p>“如果我不去，就会得罪他。唉，真想继续过这一年多的这种日子，既没有希望，也没有恐惧，既没有欢乐，也没有哀愁。”</p>
<p>‘If Mr Boldwood asked you to run away with him，what would you say，ma'am？’said Liddy with a smile.</p>
<p>“如果伯德伍德先生要你和他远走高飞，你说什么呀，太太？”利蒂微笑着说。</p>
<p>‘Now，Liddy，no joking. This is far too serious. I won't marry anyone for a long time. Get my cloak. It's time to go. ’</p>
<p>“利蒂，别开玩笑了。这可是严肃的事。我嫁给谁都长不了。给我拿斗篷，该走了。”</p>
<p>At the same time，in his farmhouse，Boldwood was also dressing He was trying on a new coat which had just been delivered. Tonight he wanted to look his best.</p>
<p>这时，伯德伍德也在房里穿衣打扮。他正在试穿刚刚送到的一件新上衣。今晚，他想以最佳状态出常</p>
<p>Just then Gabriel entered，to report on farm business.</p>
<p>就在这时，盖伯瑞尔进来了，汇报农事进展情况。</p>
<p>‘Oh，Oak，’said Boldwood. ‘You're invited to the party tonight，of course. ’</p>
<p>“来，奥克，”伯德伍德说。“你今晚是一定要参加宴会的了。”</p>
<p>‘I'll try to come，if I'm not too busy，’said Gabriel quietly. ‘I'm glad to see you looking happier，sir. ’</p>
<p>“如果我不太忙，就尽量来，”盖伯瑞尔平静地说。“看到你快活起来我真高兴，先生。”</p>
<p>‘Yes，I confess I'm cheerful tonight. But my happiness depends on a hope. Oak，my hands are shaking. Could you help me with the buttons on this coat？’And as Gabriel came forward to help，he went on feverishly，‘Oak，does a woman keep her promise to become engaged？You know women better than I do—tell me. ’</p>
<p>“你说得对，今晚我是快活。不过，我的快活取决于一个希望。奥克，我的手在抖。你能帮我系一下扣子吗？”盖伯瑞尔走上前来，伯德伍德接着热情地说，“奥克，女人答应订婚以后还会守约吗？你比我更了解女人——给我说说。”</p>
<p>‘I don't think I understand women well at all. But if she wants to put right a mistake，she may keep a promise like that. ’</p>
<p>“我觉得我并不十分了解女人，不过，如果她想纠正错事，可能会遵守那诺言的。”</p>
<p>‘I think she will，’whispered Boldwood. ‘She says she can think of me as a husband seven years after Troy's disappear-ance. ’</p>
<p>“我想她会的，”伯德伍德轻声说道。“她说在她的丈夫消失七年以后，她可以考虑我成为她的丈夫的。”</p>
<p>‘Seven years，’said Gabriel，shaking his head. ‘A long time. ’</p>
<p>“七年哪，”盖伯瑞尔说着摇了摇头。“时间太长了。”</p>
<p>‘But it isn't seven years！’answered Boldwood impatiently. ‘It's only five years，nine months and a few days now！’</p>
<p>“可现在不是七年了！”伯德伍德急切地说。“现在只剩五年九个月零几天了！”</p>
<p>‘Don't build your hopes on her promise，sir. Remember，she disappointed you once. And she's young. ’</p>
<p>“别把你的希望建立在她的许诺上面，先生。记住，她曾使你失望过一次，而且她还年轻。”</p>
<p>‘She never promised me that first time，so she's never broken her promise to me yet. I trust her to keep her word. But let's talk business for a moment，Oak. You work so hard as my farm manager that I want you to have a larger share of the profits. I know a little about your secret. You have warm feelings for her too，but you've let me succeed in courting her！I want to show you how grateful I am for that. ’</p>
<p>“那一次她本来就没答应过我什么，所以她也说不上违背过我的诺言。我相信她会说话算话的。咱们还是来说说正事吧，奥克。你为我经营农场，干得这么卖力，我想让你多拿一点利润分成。你的秘密我也知道一点，你对她也怀有热情，可你却让我去追求她！我想对你表示我由衷的感激！”</p>
<p>‘Oh，that's not necessary，thank you，’said Gabriel hurriedly. ‘I must get used to my disappointment as other men have. ’He left，rather worried by Boldwood's strange manner.</p>
<p>“嗨，那没必要，谢谢你了。”盖伯瑞尔匆忙说道，“我也必须像其他男人一样，学着习惯这种失意。”他离开了，伯德伍德奇怪的表现令他十分担心。</p>
<p>Outside the front door of Boldwood's house a group of men were talking quietly.</p>
<p>伯德伍德房子的前门外，一群男人正在悄声议论。</p>
<p>‘Sergeant Troy was seen in Casterbridge this afternoon，’said Billy Smallbury. ‘His body was never found，you know，neighbours. ’</p>
<p>“今天下午有人在卡斯特桥看到托伊中士了，”比利&middot;斯莫伯里说。“没有人见过他的尸体，乡亲们。”</p>
<p>‘Should we tell the mistress？’asked Laban Tall. ‘Poor woman！What a mistake she made in marrying him！’</p>
<p>“咱们应不应当告诉女主人呢？”拉班&middot;托尔问道。“可怜的女人！她嫁给他就是个大错误！”</p>
<p>Just then Boldwood came out and walked to the gate. He did not notice the men，who were standing in the darkness.</p>
<p>就在此时，伯德伍德出来向大门走去。他并没有注意到那些人，因为他们站在暗处。</p>
<p>‘I hope to God she'll come！’he whispered. ‘Oh，my darling，my darling，why do you make me wait like this！’</p>
<p>“上帝保佑，让她来吧！”他悄声自语。“哦，亲爱的，我亲爱的人，你干吗让我这样地等待呢？”</p>
<p>They all heard his words clearly. The sound of wheels came from the road，and Bathsheba arrived. Boldwood took her into the house，and the door closed behind them.</p>
<p>他的话他们听得清清楚楚。路上传来车轮声，芭丝谢芭到了。伯德伍德将她领进房内，并关上了门。</p>
<p>‘I didn't realize he was still in love with her！’said Billy.</p>
<p>“真没想到他还爱着她。”比利说。</p>
<p>‘Poor Mr Boldwood，the news will be hard for him，’said Jan Coggan. ‘We'll have to tell the mistress her husband's still alive. We'll go in and find the right moment to speak to her. ’</p>
<p>“可怜的伯德伍德先生，那消息可够他受的，”简&middot;考根说。“我们总得告诉女主人他的丈夫还活着。咱们进去，找个合适的时机告诉她吧。”</p>
<p>But the right moment never came. Bathsheba had planned to stay at the party for only an hour，and she was in fact preparing to leave when Boldwood found her alone in an upstairs room.</p>
<p>可是这合适的时机却没有来。芭丝谢芭本来就打算只待一个小时，伯德伍德在楼上房间发现芭丝谢芭一人独处时，她正准备离开。</p>
<p>‘Mrs Troy，you can't go！’he said wildly. ‘We've only just begun！’</p>
<p>“托伊太太，你不能走！”他狂热地说。“我们才刚刚开始啊！”</p>
<p>‘I'd like to go now. I think I'll walk home. ’</p>
<p>“我想现在就走，我准备走着回去。”</p>
<p>‘You know what I want to say to you？’Bathsheba looked silently at the floor. ’You do give it？’he said eagerly.</p>
<p>“你知道我想对你说什么吗？”芭丝谢芭默默地看着地面。“你真的给我吗？”他很急切地说。</p>
<p>‘Give what？’she asked，althoug she knew well what he meant.</p>
<p>“给什么？”她问道。其实她知道他所指的是什么。</p>
<p>‘Your promise！Just a business arrangement between two sensible people who no longer think of love. To marry me in five to six years！You owe it to me！’</p>
<p>“你的诺言呀！就当两个不再思想爱情的理智的人对一件事情进行安排吧。五、六年以后嫁给我！你理应这样的！”</p>
<p>‘I have no feeling in that matter at all，’she replied，hesitating. ‘But if I must，I promise—if I'm really a widow. ’</p>
<p>“这事我完全没有情绪，”她犹豫着回答。“但如果我必须保证，那我就保证——如果我真正成了寡妇的话。”</p>
<p>‘You'll marry me in five and three-quarter years’time？’</p>
<p>“你将在五年又九个月后嫁给我吗？”</p>
<p>‘Let me think！I'll marry nobody else. Oh，I don't know！Is Frank really dead？Perhaps I should ask a lawyer！’</p>
<p>“让我想一下！我不会嫁给别的人。唉，我也不知道！弗兰克真的死了吗？我也许应该找个律师问一问！”</p>
<p>‘Say the words，my dear one，and I won't speak about it any more. A long engagement，then marriage—Oh Bathsheba！Promise yourself to me！’he begged wildly，forgetting his cool，businesslike manner. ‘I've loved you so much and for so long！’</p>
<p>“把那句话说一遍，我亲爱的人，以后我就不会再提这事了。长长的订婚期，然后再结婚——芭丝谢芭啊！答应把你给我吧！”他狂热地恳求道，忘却了他那冷静而公事公办的作派。“我真爱你，爱了这么久！”</p>
<p>‘Very well，’she said after a pause，‘I'll marry you six years from now if we're both alive and if my husband doesn't return. ’</p>
<p>“那好吧，”她停了一会儿后说道。“如果咱们两人六年以后都还活着，如果我丈夫到时没有回来，我就嫁给你。”</p>
<p>‘Then wear this ring for me. ’Boldwood took from his pocket a diamond engagement ring，and held it out to her.</p>
<p>“那你就把这个戒指戴上，”伯德伍德从衣兜里摸出一个订婚钻戒，举在她的面前。</p>
<p>‘No，no，I can't，I don't want anyone to know！’</p>
<p>“不行，不行，我不能戴，不能让任何人知道这事！”</p>
<p>‘Just wear it tonight，to please me！’Bathsheba could say no more，and weakly let him put it on her finger. He left her.</p>
<p>“就今天晚上戴一戴，只让我高兴一下！”芭丝谢芭不能再说什么，无力地让他给自己戴上了戒指。然后他便走开了。</p>
<p>In a few minutes she was calmer. She put on her cloak and went downstairs. She paused at the foot of the stairs. Bold-wood was standing near the fire，and he had just noticed that a group of villagers were whispering among themselves.</p>
<p>过了一会儿，她镇静一点了。她披上斗篷下了楼，先是在楼梯下停了停。伯德伍德站在炉边，刚刚注意到一群村民在一旁窃窃私语。</p>
<p>‘What's the matter，men？’he asked cheerfully. ‘Is any-body engaged or married，born or dead？Tell us the news，Tall. ’</p>
<p>“什么事啊，伙计们？”他兴高采烈地问道。“是不是有人订婚了，要么是结婚了？生孩子了还是有人去世了？给我们讲讲新鲜事吧，托尔。”</p>
<p>‘I wish somebody was dead，’replied Laban Tall in a whisper.</p>
<p>“我倒希望有人真的死了，”拉班&middot;托尔低声答道。</p>
<p>‘What was that，Tall？’asked Boldwood. ‘Speak out，if you have anything to say. ’</p>
<p>“你说什么，托尔？”伯德伍德问道。大点声说出来。”</p>
<p>At that moment there was a knock on the front door. One of the men opened it. ‘A stranger wants to see Mrs Troy，’he said.</p>
<p>正在此时，前门传来敲门声。一个人去开了门。“有个陌生人要见托伊太太，”他说。</p>
<p>‘Ask him to come in，’said Boldwood.</p>
<p>“请他进来。”伯德伍德说。</p>
<p>The message was given，and Troy，wrapped up to his eyes in the cloak，stood in the doorway. Those who knew he was in the area recognized him immediately. Boldwood did not. He said，‘Come in，stranger，and have a Christmas drink with us！’</p>
<p>话传了出去，托伊用斗篷齐眼遮挡着脸站在门口。知道他在这一片活动的那几个人马上便认出了他，但是，伯德伍德没有认出他来。他说，“请进来，这位陌生的人，跟我们喝一杯圣诞喜酒吧。”</p>
<p>Troy entered，threw off his cloak and looked Boldwood in the face. But it was only when he laughed that Boldwood recognized the man who had destroyed his hope and happiness once and was about to do it again.</p>
<p>托伊进了门，脱掉斗篷，直视伯德伍德。但是，直到他哈哈大笑起来伯德伍德才认出了这个人，这个毁了他的希望和幸福，现在又要来毁他的人。</p>
<p>Troy turned to Bathsheba. She had dropped miserably on to the lowest stair. Her mouth was blue and dry，her eyes empty and staring. He said，‘Bathsheba，I've come here for you！’She did not reply. ‘Come home with me，do you hear！’He went towards her.</p>
<p>托伊转向芭丝谢芭，她早已痛苦地跌倒在楼梯上。她的嘴又青又干，眼睛茫然地瞪着。他说，“芭丝谢芭，我回来找你了！”她没有回答。“跟我回家吧，听见我的话了吗！”他向她走了过去。</p>
<p>A strange，thin voice，full of despair，came from the fire-place. ‘Bathsheba，go with your husband！’said Boldwood.</p>
<p>壁炉边传来一个奇怪的细嗓音，充满了绝望：“芭丝谢芭，跟你丈夫走！”是伯德伍德在说话。</p>
<p>She did not move，and when Troy stretched out his hand to pull her towards him，she fell back with a quick，low scream.</p>
<p>她一动未动，托伊伸手去拉她时，她迅速发出一声低沉的叫声，向后倒去。</p>
<p>A second later there was a loud bang，and the hall was filled with smoke. At Bathsheba's cry，Boldwood's despair had turned to anger. From the wall above the fireplace he had taken a gun and shot Troy，who now lay very still. Boldwood turned the gun on himself，but was stopped by one of his men.</p>
<p>刹那间，只听得“砰”的一声，大厅里顿时充满烟味。原来，伯德伍德听到芭丝谢芭的叫声，心中的绝望变成了愤怒。他从壁炉上方的墙上摘下一支枪来，向托伊开了一枪。此时，托伊一动不动地躺在地上。伯德伍德又把枪对准自己，被一个人拦下了。</p>
<p>‘It doesn't matter！’Boldwood gasped. ‘There's another way to die！’</p>
<p>“没关系的！”伯德伍德气吁吁地说。”别的死法也行！”</p>
<p>He crossed the room to Bathsheba，and kissed her hand. Then he went out into the darkness before anyone could prevent him.</p>
<p>他走到房间另一边的芭丝谢芭身边，吻了吻她的手。然后，他出门走进黑暗之中，没有人能拦得住他。</p><a href='19.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
