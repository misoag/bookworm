<p><b>3 火灾 </b></p>
<p>Two months later Gabriel went to the great fair at Casterbridge，hoping to find a job as farm manager. But when he realized by late afternoon that none of the farmers at Casterbridge wanted a farm manager，or even a shepherd，he decided to try his luck at another fair the next day. It was fifteen miles further away，in a village the other side of Weatherbury. The name Weatherbury reminded him of Bathsheba，and he wondered if she still lived there. He set out on foot as it was getting dark，and had already walked three or four miles when he saw a cart，half-full of hay，by the side of the road. ‘That's a comfortable place to sleep，’he thought，and he was so tired after his long，disappointing day at the fair that when he climbed into the cart，he fell asleep immediately.</p>
<p>两个月后，盖伯瑞尔去了位于卡斯特桥的大集市，希望找一份农场经理的工作。在下午，快结束时，他意识到卡斯特桥没有哪个农场主需要农场经理，甚或是一个牧羊人，他决定第二天到另一个集市去碰碰运气。这个集市在威瑟伯里另一边的一个村庄，还要再走15英里。威瑟伯里这个名字使他想起了芭丝谢芭，他不知道她是否还住在那儿。天将黑时，他步行着上路了。走了三四英里，他看到一辆马车停在路边，车上装着半车干草。“那个地方睡觉挺舒服，”他想，经过在集市上漫长、令人失望的一天后，他太累了。一爬上车他立刻就睡着了。</p>
<p>A couple of hours later，however，he was woken by the movement of the cart. It was being driven towards Weather－bury by two farm workers，who had not noticed Gabriel. He listened to their conversation.</p>
<p>一两个小时后，马车的颠簸惊醒了他。两个农场工人正把马车赶向威瑟伯里，他们没有注意到盖伯瑞尔。他听到了他们的谈话。</p>
<p>‘She's a handsome woman，that's true，’said one，‘but proud too！And very vain，that's what people say！’</p>
<p>“她是个很漂亮的女人，这倒不假，”一个说，“可是太傲慢！人们都说她很自负！”</p>
<p>‘Oh，if she's vain，Billy Smallbury，I'll never be able to look at her！I'm such a shy man，as you know！’said the other. ‘A single woman，and vain！And does she pay her farm workers well？’</p>
<p>“唉，比利&middot;斯摩伯里，要是她很自以为是，我就连正眼看她也不敢了！你知道，我是一个害羞的人！”另一个说。“一个单身女人，而且自负！她给她的农场工人报酬高吗？”</p>
<p>‘I don't know about that，Joseph Poorgrass. ’</p>
<p>“这个我不知道，约瑟夫&middot;普格拉斯。”</p>
<p>Gabriel thought they could be talking about Bathsheba，except that the woman they were discussing seemed to be the mistress of a farm. As the cart was now quite near Weather－bury，Gabriel jumped out，unseen by the two men. He climbed a gate into a field，intending to sleep for the rest of the night under a hay－rick，but then he noticed an unusual light in the darkness，about half a mile away. Something was on fire.</p>
<p>盖伯瑞尔想他们谈论的可能是芭丝谢芭，只是他们谈论的女人好像是一个农场的女主人。马车快到威瑟伯里时，盖伯瑞尔跳下了车，那两个人也未发现。他翻越过一个大门进了一块地里，打算在一个干草垛下过夜，就在这时，他注意到大约一英里远的地方黑暗中有不寻常的火光。有东西着火了。</p>
<p>He hurried across the fields towards the fire. Soon，in the rich orange light of the flames，he could see a hay－rick burning fiercely. It was too late to save the rick，so for a few minutes he stood and stared at the flames. But when the smoke cleared for a moment，he was horrified to see，very close to the burn－ing rick，a whole row of wheat－ricks. These probably con－tained most of the wheat produced on the farm that year，and could catch fire at any moment.</p>
<p>他穿过田地向着火的地方跑去。接着，他看到熊熊的火光中，干草垛肆虐地燃烧着。现在已来不及救干草垛了，有好几分钟他就站在那儿盯着火焰。可是当烟散开一点后，他吃惊地看到有一排麦垛就紧挨着燃烧着的干草垛。这个农场这一年产的大部分麦子可能都在这儿，这些麦垛随时有着火的可能。</p>
<p>As he rushed towards the wheat－rick that was most in dan-ger，he saw he was not alone. A crowd of farm workers had seen the fire and run into the field to help save the wheat，but they were so confused they did not know what to do. Gabriel took control and gave orders.</p>
<p>当他向最危急的一个麦垛冲去时，他看到在场的并不只是他一人。一群农场工人看到着了火，跑到地里来帮着抢救麦子。只是他们太混乱了，不知道该做什么。盖伯瑞尔控制住局面，开始发号施令。</p>
<p>‘Get a large cloth！’he shouted. ‘Put it over the wheat－rick，so the wind can't blow the flames from the hay－rick on to it！Now，you，stand here with a bucket of water and keep the cloth wet！’The men hurried to obey him. The flames，prevented from burning the bottom and sides of the wheat-32 rick，began to attack its roof.</p>
<p>“找一块大布来！”他喊道。“用布把麦垛裹住，这样干草垛上的火苗就不会被吹到麦垛上！你，拿一桶水站在这儿，让布保持湿润！”人们立刻听从他的指挥。烧不着麦垛底部和边部的火焰开始袭击顶部。</p>
<p>‘Get me a ladder！’cried Gabriel. ‘And a branch，and some water！’He climbed up the wheat－rick and sat on the top，beating down the flames with the branch. Billy Smallbury，one of the men who had been in the cart，climbed up with a bucket of water， to throw water on Gabriel and keep the flames off him. The smoke was at its thickest at this corner of the rick， but Gabriel never stopped his work.</p>
<p>“给我找一架梯子！”盖伯瑞尔大声说，‘再找一个树枝和一些水！”他爬上麦垛，坐在顶上，用树枝打灭火苗。斯摩伯里，马车上两人中的一个，提着一桶水爬了上来。他把水浇在盖伯瑞尔身上以免火苗烧到他的身上。盖伯瑞尔呆的这个角上浓烟滚滚，但他却一刻也没有停歇。</p>
<p>On the ground the villagers were doing what they could to stop the fire，which was not much. A little further away was a young woman who had just arrived on her horse，witn her maid on foot. They were watching the fire and discussing Gabriel.</p>
<p>地面上村民们也在尽自己所能地灭着火，尽管地面上的火并不大。不远处有一位骑马刚到的年轻姑娘，她的女仆步行跟着她。她们望着大火，议论着盖伯瑞尔。</p>
<p>‘He's a fine young man，ma'am，’said Liddy，the maid. ‘And look at his clothes！They're all burnt！’</p>
<p>“小姐，他真是个了不起的年轻人，”女仆利蒂说。“看他的衣服！全都烧了！”</p>
<p>‘Who does he work for？’asked the woman in a clear voice.</p>
<p>“他为谁做事？”女人用清晰的嗓音问。</p>
<p>‘I don't know，ma'am，nor do the others. He's a stranger. ’</p>
<p>“我不知道，小姐，其他人也不知道。他没来过这儿。”</p>
<p>‘Jan Coggan！’called the woman to one of her workers. ‘Do you think the wheat is safe now？’</p>
<p>“简&middot;考根！”女人向她的一个工人喊道。”麦子现在没有危险了吗？”</p>
<p>‘I think so，yes，ma'am，’he answered. ‘If the fire had spread to this wheat－rick，all the other ricks would have caught fire too. That brave young man up there on top of the rick is the one who's saved your wheat. ’</p>
<p>“我想没有危险了，小姐，”他答道。“如果火烧到这个麦垛，所有其它麦垛也都会着火的。垛顶上那位勇敢的年轻人就是救了你的麦子的人。”</p>
<p>‘He does work hard，’said the young woman，looking up at Gabriel, who had not noticed her. ‘I wish he worked for me. ’</p>
<p>“他确实很卖力，”年轻姑娘抬头看着盖伯瑞尔说道，他却没注意到她。“我真希望他是我的雇工。”</p>
<p>As the ricks were no longer in danger， Gabriel started to climb down，and at the bottom he met the maid.</p>
<p>麦垛没有什么危险了，盖伯瑞尔爬了下来，在下面他遇到了女仆。</p>
<p>‘I have a message from the farmer，who wishes to thank you for all you've done，’she said.</p>
<p>“我带来了农场主的口信，农场主想为你所做的一切感谢你，”她说。</p>
<p>‘Where is he？’asked Gabriel，suddenly aware of the chance of getting some work.</p>
<p>“他在哪儿？”盖伯瑞尔问，突然意识到这是一个找些活干的机会。</p>
<p>‘It isn't a he，it's a she，’answered the girl.</p>
<p>“不是他，是她，”姑娘答道。</p>
<p>‘A woman farmer？’asked Gabriel.</p>
<p>“女农场主？”盖伯瑞尔问。</p>
<p>‘Yes，and a rich one too！’said a villager who was standing near. ‘She inherited her uncle's farm，when he died suddenly. She has business in every bank in Casterbridge！’</p>
<p>“是的，而且还是个富有的农场主！”站在附近的一个村民说。“她的叔叔去世后，她继承了他的农常她与卡斯特桥的每家银行都有来往！”</p>
<p>‘She's over there，wrapped in a cloak，on her horse，’added the maid. In the darkness Gabriel could only see the shape of a woman sitting on a horse. He walked over to her. Although his face was black from the smoke and his clothes were burnt by the fire，he remembered to lift his hat politely，and asked, looking up at her，‘Do you want a shepherd，ma'am？’She let her cloak fall back from her head in surprise. Gabriel and his cold-hearted darling，Bathsheba Everdene，stared at each other. She did not speak. He only repeated sadly，‘Do you want a shepherd，ma'am？’</p>
<p>“她就在那儿，裹着斗篷，骑着马，”女仆加了一句。黑暗中盖伯瑞尔只能看见马上一个女人的轮廓。他向她走去。尽管他的脸被烟熏黑了，衣服也被火烧坏了，但他并没有忘记有礼貌地举举帽子。他抬头看着她问道，“小姐，你需要牧羊人吗？”她吃了一惊，斗篷从头上滑落下来，盖伯瑞尔与他冷酷的心上人，芭丝谢芭&middot;伊芙丁，对视着。她没有说话。他沮丧地又问了一句，“你需要牧羊人吗，小姐？”</p>
<p>Bathsheba turned away into the shadows to consider. She was a little sorry for him， but also glad that she had improved her position since they last met. She realized she had almost forgotten his offer of marriage on Norcombe Hill.</p>
<p>芭丝谢芭把头扭向阴影里考虑着。她有点为他难过，但又很高兴自从他们上次见面后自己的地位已今非昔比了。她意识到她差不多都不记得他在诺科姆山上曾向她求婚。</p>
<p>‘Yes，’she answered quietly，blushing a little，‘I do want a shepherd. But—’</p>
<p>“需要，”她平静地回答，脸有点红，“我的确需要一个牧羊人。只是——”</p>
<p>‘He's just the right man，ma'am，’said one of the villagers.</p>
<p>“小姐，他很合适.”一个村民说。</p>
<p>‘That's right！’said a second，and a third.</p>
<p>“一点不错！”第二个村民、第三个村民说。</p>
<p>‘Then will you men tell him to speak to the farm manager？’said Bathsheba in a businesslike way，as she rode off.</p>
<p>“那你们告诉他去和农场经理说一声，好吗？”芭丝谢芭一边骑马离开，一边以一种公事公办的口气说。</p>
<p>Gabriel soon arranged the details of his employment with Bathsheba's farm manager，Benjy Pennyways，and walked on to the village to find a place to live. As he walked，he thought of Bathsheba. How quickly the young girl he remembered had become the capable mistress of a farm！</p>
<p>盖伯瑞尔很快就与芭丝谢芭的农场经理宾尼威斯安排妥了有关他受雇的一些具体事宜，然后向村里走去，去找一个住的地方。他一边走，一边想芭丝谢芭。他认识的那个年轻姑娘才几天就成了一个农场的女主人！</p>
<p>When he passed the churchyard，and the ancient trees around it，he noticed that someone was standing behind one of the trees.</p>
<p>在经过教堂及教堂周围的古树时，他注意到有个人站在一棵树后。</p>
<p>‘Is this the right way to Weatherbury？’asked Gabriel.</p>
<p>“这是去威瑟伯里的路吗？”他问。</p>
<p>‘Oh yes，straight on，’said a girl's voice，low and sweet. After a pause she added，‘You're not a Weatherbury man？’</p>
<p>“噢，是的，一直往前走，”一个姑娘的声音，声音虽然低但甜美。停了一下她又说，“你不是威瑟伯里人？”</p>
<p>‘No，I'm the new shepherd，just arrived. ’</p>
<p>“不是，我是新来的牧羊人，刚到这里。”</p>
<p>‘Only a shepherd！You seem almost like a farmer to me. ’</p>
<p>“不过是个牧羊人！我觉得你差不多像个农场主。”</p>
<p>‘Only a shepherd，’repeated Gabriel in a dull voice，think－ing of the disaster that had destroyed his hopes of being a farmer.</p>
<p>“不过是个牧羊人，”盖伯瑞尔闷声闷气地重复着，想到了那场灾难，那场灾难破灭了他想成为农场主的希望。</p>
<p>‘Please don't tell anyone in the village that you've seen me，’begged the girl. ‘I'm rather poor，and I don't want anyone to know about me. ’ Her thin arms trembled in the cold.</p>
<p>“请你千万别对村里的任何人说看见了我，”姑娘哀求说。“我很穷，我不想让人们知道我的事。”她的瘦弱的胳膊由于天冷而颤抖着。</p>
<p>‘I won't tell anyone，’said Gabriel，‘but you ought to be wearing a cloak on a night like this. ’</p>
<p>“我谁也不告诉，”盖伯瑞尔说，“你在这样的晚上应该穿一件斗篷。”</p>
<p>‘Oh，it doesn't matter. Please go on and leave me. ’</p>
<p>“噢，没关系。请你继续赶路吧，你走吧。”</p>
<p>He hesitated ‘Perhaps you'd accept this. It's not much，but it's all I have to spare. ’He put a coin into her small hand，and as he touched her wrist he noticed how quickly the blood was beating. It was the same quick，hard beat that he felt in his lambs when they were close to death.</p>
<p>他犹豫着。“也许你会接受这个。虽然不多，我就这点富余。”他把一枚硬币放进她的小手里，触到她的手腕时，他察觉到她的脉搏跳动得异常快。他的羊羔临近死亡时，他也曾在它们身上感到了同样迅速、剧烈的跳动。</p>
<p>‘What's the matter？Can't I help you？’he asked. He felt a deep sadness in this thin，weak creature.</p>
<p>“出了什么事？我不能帮你吗？”他问道。他感到这瘦弱可怜的人儿怀有一种深深的悲哀。</p>
<p>‘No，no！Don't tell anyone you've seen me！Good night！’She stayed in the shadows，and Gabriel went on to Weather-bury.</p>
<p>“不，不！别告诉任何人你见过我！再见！”她呆在黑暗中，盖伯瑞尔继续向威瑟伯里走去。</p><a href='4.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
