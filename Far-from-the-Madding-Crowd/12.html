<p><b>12 芭丝谢芭作出抉择 </b></p>
<p>On the same day that Bathsheba arrived home， Mr Boldwood went to apologize to her for speaking so violently the last time he had seen her. He knew nothing of her trip to Bath，and supposed she had only been to visit Liddy. But at her door he was told he could not see her，and he realized she had not forgiven him.</p>
<p>芭丝谢芭到家的那天，伯德伍德先生前去准备向她致歉，告诉她上次见她时自己说话不该那么粗声粗气。他并不知她去过巴斯，只以为她是刚去看过利蒂。但是到了她家门口，有人告诉他不能见她，他这才知道她并未原谅他。</p>
<p>On his way home through Weatherbury he saw the coach from Bath. It stopped at the usual place，and a soldier in a red and gold uniform jumped down. Sergeant Troy picked up his bag and was about to take the road to Bathsheba's house，when Boldwood stepped forward.</p>
<p>在穿过威瑟伯里回家的路上，他看见了来自巴斯的马车。车停在老地方，一个身着红色镶金制眼的士兵跳了下来，是托伊中士。他提起包，正准备向芭丝谢芭家走，伯德伍德走上前来。</p>
<p>‘Sergeant Troy？I am William Boldwood. ’</p>
<p>“托伊中士吗？我叫威廉&middot;伯德伍德。”</p>
<p>‘Indeed？’said Troy，showing little interest.</p>
<p>“是吗？”托伊说着，一副不感兴趣的样子。</p>
<p>‘I want to speak to you—about two women. ’</p>
<p>“我想和你谈谈——谈谈两个女人的事。”</p>
<p>Troy saw the heavy stick Boldwood was holding，and real－ized how determined he was. He decided it was worth being polite.</p>
<p>托伊看到伯德伍德拿着的大棒，知道这人决意要谈，于是便想，礼貌点还是划算的。</p>
<p>‘I'll listen with pleasure，but do speak quietly. ’</p>
<p>“我将很乐意听你说，不过请不要声张。”</p>
<p>‘Well then，I've heard about your relationship with Fanny Robin，and I think you ought to marry her. ’</p>
<p>“好吧。我听说你与范妮&middot;罗宾有关系，我想你应当娶她为妻。”</p>
<p>‘I suppose I ought. Indeed，I want to，but I cannot. ’</p>
<p>“我想是应当。我也确实想这样，可我不能。”</p>
<p>‘Why can't you？’</p>
<p>“为什么不能？”</p>
<p>Troy was going to reply immediately，but he stopped him－self. ‘I am too poor，’he said，looking quickly at Boldwood to see if the farmer believed him. Boldwood did not notice the look.</p>
<p>托伊准备马上回答，可又停住口。“我太穷了，”他说，一边瞥了伯德伍德一眼，看着这位农场主信不信自己的话。可伯德伍德并没有注意到他的表情。</p>
<p>‘I don't want to talk about right or wrong，I just want to discuss business with you. I was engaged to Miss Everdene，when you came and—’</p>
<p>“我并不想谈论是与非，我只是想和你谈正事。你来的时候，我和芭丝谢芭已经订婚了——”</p>
<p>‘Not engaged，’said Troy.</p>
<p>“没有订婚吧，”托伊说。</p>
<p>‘More or less engaged，’insisted Boldwood. ‘If you hadn't come，she would certainly have accepted my proposal by now. Well，her position in society is so much higher than yours that you can't hope to marry her. So all I ask is that you don't bother her any more，and marry Fanny. ’</p>
<p>“差不多订婚了，”伯德伍德坚持道。“如果不是你来，现在她肯定早已接受我的求婚了。嗯，她的社会地位远比你高，你就别指望娶她了。所以，我请你做的事就是，别再烦她，和范妮结婚吧。”</p>
<p>‘Why should I？’asked Troy carelessly.</p>
<p>“我干吗要这样？”托伊漫不经心地问道。</p>
<p>‘I'll pay you. If you leave Weatherbury today，I'll give you fifty pounds Fanny will have fifty pounds for wedding clothes，and I'll give her five hundred pounds the day she marries you. ’Boldwood's manner showed that he was a little ashamed of offering money，but he was prepared to do almost anything to prevent Troy marrying Bathsheba.</p>
<p>“我付给你钱。如果你今天就离开威瑟伯里，我付你50镑。范妮也会得到50镑去买嫁衣。她嫁给你那天，我会再给她500镑的。”伯德伍德的样子像是因付钱而略显羞臊，但是，他准备不借一切阻止托伊把芭丝谢芭娶到手。</p>
<p>Troy appeared to consider the offer. ‘It's true I like Fanny best，although she's only a maid. Fifty pounds now，you said？’</p>
<p>托伊似乎在考虑这一提议。“我是喜欢范妮，虽然她只是个女仆。现在付50镑，对吗？”</p>
<p>‘Here's the money，’said Boldwood，handing the soldier a purse of gold coins.</p>
<p>“给你钱，”伯德伍德说着，把一袋金币递给了那个兵。</p>
<p>‘Stop，listen！’said Troy in a whisper. Light footsteps could be heard on the road，coming from Bathsheba's house.</p>
<p>“等一下！你听！”托伊悄声说道。轻微的脚步声从路上传来，来自芭丝谢芭的房子。</p>
<p>‘It's Bathsheba！She's expecting me. I must go and speak to 132 her，and say goodbye to her，as you and I have arranged. ’</p>
<p>“是芭丝谢芭！她在等我，我得跟她去说句话，告个别。按你我安排的那样。”</p>
<p>‘Why do you need to speak to her？’</p>
<p>“你干吗要和她说话？”</p>
<p>‘She'll look for me if I don't. Don't worry，you'll hear every word I say to her. It may help you in your courting，when I've gone！Stand over there behind the tree，and listen. ’</p>
<p>“我不和她说句话，她会找我的。别担心，我对她说的每个字都会让你听到的，我走后，这些话对你追求她会有用处的。过来站在树后听着。”</p>
<p>Troy stepped forward and whistled a double note.</p>
<p>托伊迈步向前，用口哨吹了一个双音。</p>
<p>‘Frank，darling，is that you？’It was Bathsheba's voice.</p>
<p>“弗兰克，亲爱的，是你吗？”这是芭丝谢芭的声音。</p>
<p>‘Oh God！’said Boldwood，unheard behind the tree.</p>
<p>“喔哟，天哪！”伯德伍德说道。不过因在树后，没有人听到。</p>
<p>‘Yes，it's me，’replied Troy.</p>
<p>“是的，是我。”托伊回答道。</p>
<p>‘You'rs so late，Frank，’she continued. ‘The coach arrived a long time ago！Frank，it's so lucky！There's nobody in my house except me tonight，so nobody will know about your visit. ’</p>
<p>“你来晚了，弗兰克，”她接着说。“马车早就到了！弗兰克，咱们真走运！今晚，我屋里除了我没有别人，谁也不会知道你来。”</p>
<p>‘Excellent，’said Troy. ‘But I'll just have to cdlect my bag，so you run home and I promise to be there in ten minutes. ’</p>
<p>“好极了，”托伊说。“不过我得去拿我的包。这样吧，你先回去，我保证十分钟后到。”</p>
<p>‘Yes，Frank. ’She ran back to her house.</p>
<p>“好吧，弗兰克。”她跑回了家。</p>
<p>Troy turned to Boldwood，who had stepped out from behind the tree，his face white and his whole body trembling.</p>
<p>伯德伍德从树后走出来，脸色惨白，浑身发抖。托伊向伯德伍德转过身去。</p>
<p>‘Shall I tell her I cannot marry her？’laughed the soldier.</p>
<p>“我对她说不能娶她，好吗？”这个兵笑了起来。</p>
<p>‘No，no，wait！I have more to say to you！whispered Boldwood，the muscles in his face strangely out of control.</p>
<p>“别，别！等一下！我还有话对你说！”伯德伍德低声说。他脸部的肌肉不可思议地失去了控制。</p>
<p>‘Now，’said Troy，‘you see my problem. I can't marry them both. But I have two reasons for choosing Fanny. First，I like her best，I think，and second，you're paying me for it. ’</p>
<p>“这下你看到我的问题了吧，”托伊说，“我又不能娶她们两个人。不过我选择范妮有两个理由，首先，我想我最喜欢她；再说，你还为此付钱。”</p>
<p>At that moment Boldwood lost control. He attacked Troy fiercely，holding his neck with botn hands.</p>
<p>伯德伍德再也控制不住了。他猛地袭向托伊，用双手掐住了他的脖子。</p>
<p>‘Wait，’gasped Troy，who had not expected this，‘let me breathe！If you kill me，you injure the woman you love！’</p>
<p>“等等，”托伊有点透不过气来了，他没想到会是这样。“让我出口气！你要是掐死我，你就会伤害你爱的女人。”</p>
<p>‘What do you mean？’cried the farmer. ‘I should kill you like a dog！’But he let go of Troy's neck，and listened.</p>
<p>“什么意思？”农场主喊道。“我杀你就像杀一只狗！”他松开托伊的脖子，听他说话。</p>
<p>‘You heard how Bathsheba loves me and expects me to visit her tonight Soon the whole village will know this. The only way to save her good name，and her position in Weatherbury，is for me to marry her. ’</p>
<p>“芭丝谢芭怎样爱我，你都听到了。她晚上还等着我去呢，这事全村人很快就都会知晓的。要想为她保留好名声，保住她在威瑟伯里的地位，唯一的办法就是让我娶她。”</p>
<p>‘True，true，’agreed Boldwood after a pause. ‘Troy，marry her！Poor，weak woman！She must love you madly to give herself so completely to you！’</p>
<p>“对，说得对，”伯德伍德顿了一顿后说道。“娶了她吧，托伊！可怜的弱女子！她这么完全献身给你，肯定是爱你爱得发疯！”</p>
<p>‘But what about Fanny？’asked the soldier cleverly.</p>
<p>“不过，范妮怎么办？”那士兵机巧地问。</p>
<p>‘Don't desert her，Troy，I beg you！I don't mean Fanny，I'm speaking of Bathsheba！How can I persuade you？I know！I'll pay you five hundred pounds on the day you marry Bathsheba！’</p>
<p>“别抛弃她，托伊，我求你！我不是说范妮，我是说芭丝谢芭。我怎么说服你呢？我知道！你娶芭丝谢芭的那天，我给你500镑！”</p>
<p>Troy was secretly shocked at Boldwood's wild offer.</p>
<p>伯德伍德这样胡乱给钱，令托伊暗自吃惊。</p>
<p>‘And I'll receive something now as well？’he asked.</p>
<p>“现在我也会得到点什么吗？”他问道。</p>
<p>‘Yes，all the money I have with me！’He counted the coins in his pocket. ‘Twenty－one pounds—it's all for you！’</p>
<p>“是的，我身上带的钱全都给你！”他数着衣袋里的硬币。“21镑——都给你！”</p>
<p>‘Give me the money，and we'll go to her house. I'll ask her to marry me. Of course I won't say anything about the money. ’</p>
<p>“把钱给我，然后咱们去她家。我请她嫁给我。当然了我不会提钱的事。”</p>
<p>They went along the road to the farmhouse，and Boldwood waited outside while Troy entered. He returned in a moment with a piece cut out of a Bath newspaper.</p>
<p>他们二人沿路向农场走去，托伊进了房内，伯德伍德则在外边等候。不一会儿，托伊出来了，手里拿着一张巴斯一家报纸的剪报。</p>
<p>‘Here，read this first，’he said，smiling. And Boldwood read：</p>
<p>“来，先念一念。”他微笑着说。伯德伍德念道：</p>
<p>MARRIAGES：On the 17th，in Bath，Frank Troy，Sergeant，to Bathsheba Everdene of Weatherbury.</p>
<p>结婚启事：中士弗兰克&middot;托伊与威瑟伯里的芭丝谢芭&middot;伊芙丁于17日在巴斯结婚。</p>
<p>The paper fell from Boldwood's hands，as the soldier began to laugh. ‘Fifty pounds to marry Fanny. Twenty－one pounds not to marry Fanny，but Bathsheba. And now you see I'm already Bathsheba's husband. You're a fool，Boldwood. Although I may be a bad man，I'd never bribe anyone to mar-ry，as you've tried to. And Fanny？She left me long ago，and I don't know where she is. I've searched everywhere for her. Now take your money back！I don't want it！’and Troy threw the gold coins into the road.</p>
<p>剪报从伯德伍德手中滑落，士兵托伊笑了起来。“给了我50镑娶范妮，给了我21镑要我不娶范妮，娶芭丝谢芭。现在你看见了吧，我已经是芭丝谢芭的丈夫了。你是个傻瓜，伯德伍德。虽然我可能是个坏人，可是我决不会像你那样花钱买动别人去娶老婆。范妮呢？她早就离我而去了，我不知道她现在何处，我四处寻找过她。把你的钱拿回去吧，我不想要！“托伊说着，把钱扔到了路上。</p>
<p>‘You black－hearted dog！I'll punish you one day，remember that！’cried the broken man. Troy laughed loudly as he closed Bathsheba's front door.</p>
<p>“你这个黑了心的狗！你记着，我总有一天要惩罚你的！”伯德伍德心情沮丧地大叫。托伊哈哈大笑着关上了芭丝谢芭家的前门。</p>
<p>Through the whole of the long night that followed，Boldwood's dark figure could be seen walking over the hills of Weatherbury like a ghost.</p>
<p>那天晚上长长的一整夜，人们都能看见伯德伍德黑乎乎的身影像幽魂一样在威瑟伯里的山上行走。</p>
<p>Just before the clock struck five the next morning，Gabriel and Coggan were walking to the hayfields past their mistress's house，when they saw a surprising sight. Bathsheba's bedroom window was open，and looking out of it was a hand-some man，with his red jacket undone. It was Sergeant Troy.</p>
<p>次日清晨，钟还没有敲五点，盖伯瑞尔和考根路过女主人的房子向干草地走去，突然看到一个意外的情景。芭丝谢芭卧室的窗户打开着，有个英俊男子正在向外张望，红色上衣解开着。那是托伊中士。</p>
<p>‘She's married him！’whispered Coggan. Gabriel said nothing，but he felt so ill that he had to rest on the gate for a moment. He thought with pity of her future，as he knew her marriage to Troy could not be happy for long.</p>
<p>“她嫁给他啦！”考根悄声说道。盖伯瑞尔什么也没有说，可心里直堵，只得靠在大门上歇一会儿。他为她的将来感到惋惜，因为他知道，她与托伊的婚姻会好景不长。</p>
<p>‘Good morning，friends！’shouted Troy cheerfully to the men.</p>
<p>“早上好啊，朋友们！”托伊兴高采烈地向他们喊道。</p>
<p>‘We must be polite to him，’whispered Coggan，‘if he's married the mistress. ’</p>
<p>“咱们得对他礼貌一点，”考根悄声说道。“他不是娶了咱们女主人欧。”</p>
<p>‘Good morning，Sergeant Troy，’said Gabriel miserably.</p>
<p>“早上好，托伊中士，”盖伯瑞尔痛苦地说。</p>
<p>‘Now that I've left the army，I'll soon be down in the fields with you again，’said Troy lightly. ‘My new position won't change that，and I'll be friendly with you all，just as before. Drink to my health，men. ’And he threw a coin towards Gabriel，who refused to pick it up. Coggan，however，put it in his pocket.</p>
<p>“我退了伍，就很快会再和你们到地里干活的，”托伊轻快地说。“我的新身份也不会改变这一点的，我还会对你们友好如初。为我的健康喝一杯去吧，伙计们。”他向盖伯瑞尔扔出一个硬币，盖伯瑞尔没捡，但考根把硬币捡起来放到了衣兜里。</p>
<p>As they went on their way，they noticed Mr Boldwood riding past them. Gabriel forgot his own sadness when he saw the bitterness and deep despair on the farmer's face.</p>
<p>他们走在路上，看到伯德伍德先生骑马走过他们身边。盖伯瑞尔看到农场主脸上的苦楚与深深的绝望，自己的悲伤心情便忘记了。</p><a href='13.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
