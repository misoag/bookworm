<p><b>4 范妮&middot;罗宾失踪了 </b></p>
<p>The farm manager had advised Gabriel to go straight to the malthouse in Weatherbury，to ask for somewhere to stay. That was the place where the men of the village spent their evenings，drinking beer and talking by the fire. When Gabriel entered the warm，dark room，some of Bathsheba's workers recognized him.</p>
<p>农场经理劝盖伯瑞尔径直去威瑟伯里的酒吧问问住的地方。这是一个村里的人消磨晚上的时光、喝酒、围着火聊天的地方。盖伯瑞尔进到这个暖和、昏暗的屋子时，芭丝谢芭的一些雇工认出了他。</p>
<p>‘Come in，shepherd，you're welcome，’said one.</p>
<p>“进来，牧羊人，欢迎你，”一个村民说。</p>
<p>‘Gabriel Oak is my name，neighbours. ’</p>
<p>“我叫盖伯瑞尔&middot;奥克，乡亲们。”</p>
<p>The ancient maltster，with his white hair and long white beard，turned his old head stiffly towards Gabriel. ‘Gabriel Oak of Norcombe！’he said. ‘I knew your grandparents well！My boy Jacob and his young son Billy know your family too. ’His boy Jacob was bald and toothless，and young Billy was about forty.</p>
<p>年老的酒店老板，留着白发和长长的白胡子，僵硬地把头转向盖伯瑞尔。“诺科姆的盖伯瑞尔&middot;奥克！”他说，“我与你的祖父母很熟！我儿子雅各布和他的小儿子比利也认识你们家。”他的儿子雅各布头秃了，牙也没了。小儿子比利大约有四十岁。</p>
<p>‘You must be very old，maltster，’said Gabriel politely，‘to have such an old son as Jacob here. ’</p>
<p>“有雅各布这样大的儿子，你一定年纪不小了，老板，”盖伯瑞尔礼貌地说。</p>
<p>‘Yes，I've lived for over a hundred years，’replied the little old man proudly. ‘Sit down and drink with us，shepherd. ’</p>
<p>“是的，我活了有一百多年了，”小老头骄傲地答道。“牧羊人，坐下和我们喝一杯。”</p>
<p>The cup of warm beer passed round the circle of drinkers. There was silence for a moment. Then Gabriel turned the conversation to the matter closest to his heart.</p>
<p>盛有热啤酒的杯子在一圈饮酒者中传递着。一阵沉默之后，盖伯瑞尔把话题转到他最关心的事情上。</p>
<p>‘What kind of mistress is Miss Everdene？’he asked.</p>
<p>“伊芙丁小姐是个什么样的女主人？”他问。</p>
<p>‘We know almost nothing of her，shepherd，’answered Jan Coggan，a big，cheerful man with a red face. ‘She only arrived here a few days ago，when her uncle died. But the Everdenes are a good family to work for. Of course，it's the farm manager who'll be giving us our orders. ’</p>
<p>“牧羊人，我们对她几乎一无所知，”简&middot;考根答道。这是一个有着一张红脸，大大的个子，快快活活的人。“几天前她叔叔死后她才来到这里。不过，给伊芙丁家族干活没错。当然，对我们发号施令的是农场经理。”</p>
<p>‘Ah！’said the maltster，frowning. ‘Benjy Pennyways！’</p>
<p>“噢！”酒店老板皱着眉说。“本杰&middot;宾尼威斯！”</p>
<p>‘You can't trust him！’added Jacob darkly.</p>
<p>“他让人信不过！”雅各布恨恨地接着说。</p>
<p>Soon afterwards Gabriel left with Jan Coggan，who had offered the shepherd a bed in his house. The remaining men were just preparing to leave when suddenly a young man called Laban Tall rushed into the malthouse，almost too excited to speak.</p>
<p>盖伯瑞尔接着就与简&middot;考根离开了，简说在他家里可以给盖伯瑞尔找个床位。正当其他人准备离去时，一个名叫拉班&middot;托尔的年轻人冲进酒店。他激动得有点说不出话来。</p>
<p>‘It's Benjy Pennyways！’he cried. ‘Miss Everdene's caught him stealing wheat from the barn！She's sent him away！And worse than that——Fanny Robin，you know，Miss Everdene's youngest maid，is missing！The mistress wants us to look for her tomorrow. And Billy Smallbury，she wants you to go to Casterbridge，to see if you can find the young soldier who's been courting Fanny. ’</p>
<p>“是本杰&middot;宾尼威斯！”他大声说。“伊芙丁小姐抓住他在谷仓偷麦子！小姐已把他打发走了！还有更糟的事呢——伊芙丁小姐最年幼的女仆范妮&middot;罗宾失踪了！女主人要我们明天去找她。另外，比利&middot;斯摩伯里，女主人要你去卡斯特桥，看是否能找到一直在追求范妮的那个年轻士兵。”</p>
<p>That night the news spread fast round the village，but did not reach Gabriel，whose dreams were only of Bathsheba. Through the long slow hours of darkness he saw her lovely face and forgot that she did not love him.</p>
<p>那天夜里，消息传遍了整个村庄，唯有盖伯瑞尔不知晓，因为他脑子里只想着芭丝谢芭。在漫长的黑夜里，他看到了她姣美的面庞，忘记她并不爱他。</p>
<p>The next morning Bathsheba and her maid Liddy were dust-ing some books，when a visitor arrived at the front door. It was Mr Boldwood，who had a large farm in Weatherbury.</p>
<p>第二天早晨，芭丝谢芭和女仆利蒂在清扫书上的灰尘时，一位来访者站在了前门。此人是伯德伍德先生，他在威瑟伯里拥有一个大农常</p>
<p>‘I can't see him like this，Liddy！’said Bathsheba，looking in horror at her dusty dress. ‘Go down and tell him I'm busy. ’</p>
<p>“利蒂，我不能这样去见他！”芭丝谢芭说，惊慌地看着自己满是灰尘的裙子。“下去告诉他我很忙。”</p>
<p>When Liddy came back， after Mr Boldwood had gone，Bathsheba asked，‘What did he want， Liddy？ And who is he，exactly？’</p>
<p>伯德伍德先生走后，利蒂返了回来，芭丝谢芭问，“他有什么事，利蒂？他究意是谁？”</p>
<p>‘He just wanted to ask if Fanny had been found，miss. You know，as she had no family or friends，he was kind enough to pay for her to go to school，and found her a job here with your uncle. He's your neighbour. His farm is next to yours. ’</p>
<p>“小姐，他只想问问范妮是否找到了。你知道，范妮没有家，也没有朋友，伯德伍德先生好心地给她付钱让她去上学，还在你叔叔这里给她找了事干。他是你的邻居，他的农场就挨着你的农常”</p>
<p>‘Is he married？ And how old is he？’</p>
<p>“他结婚了吗？他有多大年纪？”</p>
<p>‘He isn't married. He's abeut forty，very handsome—and rich. All the girls in the area have tried to persuade him to marry. But he just doesn't seem interested in women. Have you ever had an offer of marriage，miss？’</p>
<p>“他还没有结婚。四十来岁，很英俊，也很有钱。这个地方的姑娘们都想劝说他结婚。可他好像对女人不感兴趣。小姐，有人向你求过婚吗？”</p>
<p>‘Yes，I have，Liddy，’answered Bathsheba after a pause，thinking of Gabriel. ‘But he wasn't quite good enough for me. ’</p>
<p>“有过，利蒂，”芭丝谢芭停了一下说，想起了盖伯瑞尔。“不过，他有点配不上我。”</p>
<p>‘Oh，how nice to be able to refuse，when most of us are glad to accept the first offer！ And did you love him，miss？’</p>
<p>“噢，我们大部分人都是一有人求婚就赶快接受，而你却能拒绝，多好啊！小姐，你爱他吗？”</p>
<p>‘Oh no. But I rather liked him. ’</p>
<p>‘不，不过我挺喜欢他。”</p>
<p>In the afternoon Bathsheba called her workers together，and spoke to them in the old hall of the farmhouse.</p>
<p>下午，芭丝谢芭把她的雇工都召集到屋子里的旧大厅里。</p>
<p>‘Men，I want to tell you that I'm not going to employ a new farm manager. I shall manage the farm myself. ’There were gasps of surprise from the men. She gave her orders for the next week's farm work and then turned to one of the 46 men. ‘Billy Smallbury， what have you discovered about Fanny Robin？’</p>
<p>“乡亲们，我想告诉你们我并不打算雇一个新的农场经理。我想自己管理农常”人群中传出惊叹声。她布置了下星期农场的工作，然后转向其中一人。“比利&middot;斯摩伯里，范妮&middot;罗宾有消息吗？”</p>
<p>‘I think she's run away with her young man，ma'am. The soldiers have left Casterbridge，and I suppose she's gone with them. ’</p>
<p>“小姐，我猜她是跟她的那个年轻人跑了。士兵们已经离开了卡斯特桥，我想她跟他们一起走了。”</p>
<p>‘Well，perhaps we'll discover more later. One of you can go and tell Mr Boldwood what Billy says. Now，men，I hope I can trust you all to do your work well for me. Goodnight. ’</p>
<p>“好吧，也许以后会发现些什么。你们一个人去告诉伯德伍德先生比利所说的。乡亲们，我希望我可以相信你们所有的人会为我好好干的。晚安。”</p>
<p>Later that evening，in a town many miles north of Weather bury，a small white shape could be seen walking slowly along a path beside a large building. It was a dull，snowy night，with heavy grey clouds hanging low in the sky，the kind of night when hopes are destroyed and love is lost.</p>
<p>那天晚上晚些时候，在威瑟伯里以北好几英里的一个镇上，人们可以看到一个白色的、矮小的影子在一幢大建筑物旁的小路上慢慢地走着。这是一个阴沉的、下着雪的夜晚，乌云低低地挂在天边，这是那种破灭希望、失去爱情的夜晚。</p>
<p>‘One. Two. Three. Four. Five. ’The white shape was counting windows in the building. Then it began to throw small stones，covered in snow，at the fifth window. At last the window opened，and a man called out，‘Who's there？’</p>
<p>“一、二、三、四、五。”白色的影子数着建筑物上的窗户。然后她开始朝第五个窗口投掷裹着雪的小石头。终于，窗户打开了，一个人喊道，“谁在那儿？”</p>
<p>‘Is that Sergeant Troy？’asked a girl's voice.</p>
<p>“是托伊中士吗？”一个姑娘的声音问。</p>
<p>‘Yes，’answered the man. ‘Who are you？’</p>
<p>“是我，”那人答道。“你是谁？”</p>
<p>‘Oh Frank，don't you know me？’cried the girl desperately.</p>
<p>“欧，弗兰克，你不认识我了吗？”姑娘绝望地喊道。</p>
<p>‘I'm your—I'm Fanny Robin. ’</p>
<p>“我是你的——我是范妮&middot;罗宾。”</p>
<p>‘Fanny！’gasped the man in surprise. ‘How did you get here？’</p>
<p>“范妮！’那人惊叫道。“你是怎么到了这里的？”</p>
<p>‘I walked most of the way from Weatherbury. But，Frank，are you glad to see me？ Frank，when will it be？’</p>
<p>“我从威瑟伯里一路走着来的。弗兰克，见到我你高兴吗？弗兰克，那事定在什么时候？”</p>
<p>‘What are you talking about？’</p>
<p>“你说什么？”</p>
<p>‘You know，you promised. When shall we be married，Frank？’</p>
<p>“你知道，你答应过。我们什么时候结婚，弗兰克？”</p>
<p>‘Oh，I see. Well—you need proper clothes—we must inform the vicar. It takes time. I didn't expect you to come so soon. ’</p>
<p>“噢，明白了。可是——你需要合适的衣服——我们需要通知牧师。这些需要时间。我没料到你这么早就会来。”</p>
<p>‘Oh Frank，I love you so！And—you said you'd marry me—’</p>
<p>“欧，弗兰克，我非常爱你。你说过要和我结婚——”</p>
<p>‘Don't cry now！It's foolish. If I said so，of course I will. I'll come and see you tomorrow to decide the details. ’</p>
<p>“好了，别哭。别犯傻。如果我那样说过，当然我会和你结婚。我明天去看你，咱们到时商量细节。”</p>
<p>‘Oh yes，Frank，do！I'm staying at Mrs Twill’s in North Street. Come tomorrow，Frank！Goodnight，Frank！’</p>
<p>“好的，弗兰克，你可一定来！我住在北街退尔太太旅店。明天一定来，弗兰克！再见，弗兰克！”</p><a href='5.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
