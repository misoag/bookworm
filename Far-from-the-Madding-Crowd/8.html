<p><b>8 芭丝谢芭的羊群遇到了危险 </b></p>
<p>Because Bathsheba was not at all in love with Farmer Boldwood，she was able to consider his proposal of marriage calmly. It was an offer which many women of good family in the area would have been delighted to accept. He was serious，respectable and rich. If she had wanted a husband，she could not have found a good reason for refusing to marry him. But she was still enjoying her new position as mistress of a farm and house，and although she respected and liked him，she did not want to marry him However she was honest enough to feel that，as she had begun the courting by sending him the valentine，she ought not to refuse him now. There was only one person whose opinion she trusted more than her own，and that person was Gabriel Oak. So the next day she decided to ask his advice. She found him with Jan Coggan，sharpening the shears which would be used to shear the sheep.</p>
<p>芭丝谢芭一点儿也不爱农场主伯德伍德，所以她可以平心静气地考虑他的求婚。他的求婚是这个地区许多家境富裕的女人都求之不得的。伯德伍德严谨、可敬，而且富有。如果芭丝谢芭要找一个丈夫的话，她找不出理由来拒绝和他结婚。不过，她现在还相当喜欢她的这个农场女主人的新位置的。尽管她尊敬他，喜欢他，但并不想和他结婚。她诚心诚意地觉得，既然是由于自己给他寄了情人卡而开始了这场求婚，所以不应该现在拒绝他。只有一个人的意见她比对自己的意见更加信赖，这个人就是盖伯瑞尔&middot;奥克。第二天，她决定去问问他的意见。她发现他和简&middot;考根在一起磨剪羊毛的剪刀。</p>
<p>‘Jan，go and help Joseph with the horses，’she ordered. ‘I'll help you，Gabriel. I want to talk to you. ’</p>
<p>“简，你去帮约瑟夫弄马去，”她命令说。“我来帮你，盖伯瑞尔。我想和你谈谈。”</p>
<p>The shears were sharpened on a stone which was turned by a wheel，which was itself turned by a handle. Bathsheba could not manage the handle，so she held the shears while Gabriel turned the handle. ‘You aren't holding them right，miss，’he told her. ‘Let me show you how He let go of the handle，and put his large hands round hers，to hold the shears. ‘Like that，’he said，continuing to hold her hands for a peculiarly long time.</p>
<p>剪刀是在一块由一个轮子带着转动的石头上磨快，轮子上按着一个摇柄。芭丝谢芭摇不了摇柄，所以她拿着剪刀，盖伯瑞尔摇摇柄。“小姐，你拿剪刀的方法不对，”他对她说。“我来教你怎么拿。”他松开摇柄，用他的大手握住她的手，拿着剪刀。“像这样拿着，”他说，好半天一直握着她的手。</p>
<p>‘That's enough，’said Bathsheba. ‘I don't want my hands held！Turn the handle！’They went on sharpening the shears. ‘Gabriel，what do the men think about me and Mr Bold-wood？’</p>
<p>“行了，”芭丝谢芭说。“我不想让人握着我的手！去摇摇柄！”他们继续磨剪刀。“盖伯瑞尔，人们怎么看我和伯德伍德先生？”</p>
<p>‘They say you'll marry him before the end of the year，miss. ’</p>
<p>“小姐，人们说你在年底前会和他结婚。”</p>
<p>‘What a foolish thing to say！I want you to contradict it，Gabriel. ’</p>
<p>“这样说是愚蠢的！盖伯瑞尔，我要你反驳这种说法。”</p>
<p>‘Well，Bathsheba！’said Gabriel，staring at her in surprise.</p>
<p>“怎么回事？芭丝谢芭！”盖伯瑞尔吃惊地瞪着她说。</p>
<p>‘Miss Everdene，you mean，’she said.</p>
<p>“你该称呼伊芙丁小姐吧，”她说。</p>
<p>‘Well，if Mr Boldwood really asked you to marry him，I'm not going to contradict that，just to please you. ’</p>
<p>“如果伯德伍德先生真的要你和他结婚，那我并不想为了取悦你而去反驳那种说法。”</p>
<p>‘I said I wanted you just to say it wasn't true that I was going to marry him，’she said，less confidently.</p>
<p>“我说我只是想要你说我没有打算和他结婚这回事，”她有点心虚地说。</p>
<p>‘I can say that，if you wish，Miss Everdene. I could also give my opinion of the way you've behaved. ’</p>
<p>“伊芙丁小姐，如果你希望，我可以去说。我还可以对你的所作所为谈谈我的看法。”</p>
<p>He continued with his work. Bathsheba knew that he would always give his honest opinion，even if she asked him whether she should marry another man，and there was nobody else she could trust. ‘Well，what is your opinion of my behaviour？’she asked.</p>
<p>他继续干他的活。芭丝谢芭知道既使她问他自己是否应该和另一个男人结婚，他也总是会实实在在地说出他的看法的。没有谁比盖伯瑞尔更使她信任了。“那你怎么看我做的那件事？”她问。</p>
<p>‘No good，respectable woman would behave like that，’he replied. ‘You should never have sent him that valentine. ’</p>
<p>“不怎么样，体面的女人不会那样做的，”他回答说。“你决不该送他那张情人卡。”</p>
<p>Bathsheba blushed angrily. ‘Luckily I don't care about your opinion！Why do you think I'm not good or respectable，I wonder？Because I didn't agree to marry you，perhaps！’</p>
<p>芭丝谢芭气红了脸。“幸好我不在乎你说的！我不知道你怎么会觉得我不好，不体面！也许是因为我不同意和你结婚！”</p>
<p>‘Not at all. ’said Gabriel quietly. ‘I've long ago stopped thinking about that. ’</p>
<p>“根本不是，”盖伯瑞尔平静地说。“很久以前我就不想那件事了。”</p>
<p>‘Or wishing it，I suppose，’she said，expecting him to protest that he still loved her.</p>
<p>“我猜想也不抱希望了？”她说，希望他会抗议说他仍爱着她。</p>
<p>‘Or wishing It，’repeated Gabriel calmly.</p>
<p>“不抱希望了，”盖伯瑞尔平静地重复。</p>
<p>Bathsheba would not have minded being spoken to angrily by Gabriel for her thoughtlessness，if only he had told her he loved her. But his cold words of blame annoyed her greatly.</p>
<p>若是盖伯瑞尔告诉芭丝谢芭他爱她的话，芭丝谢芭并不会在意他由于她欠考虑而斥责她。但是他责备时冷漠的言词却使她很恼火。</p>
<p>‘I cannot allow any man to accuse me of bad behaviour！’ she cried. ‘So you will leave the farm at the end of the week！’</p>
<p>“我不能允许任何人指责我行为不检点！”她大声说。“你这个周末走吧！”</p>
<p>‘All right，I will，’said Gabriel calmly. ‘In fact I would rather go at once. ’</p>
<p>“行，我会走的，”盖伯瑞尔平静地说。“实际上我更愿意现在就走。”</p>
<p>‘Go at once then！’she replied angrily. ‘Don't let me see your face any more. ’</p>
<p>“那现在就走吧！”她生气地说。“别再让我看见你。”</p>
<p>‘Very well，Miss Everdene. ’And so be took his shears and walked quietly away.</p>
<p>“很好，伊芙丁小姐。”他拿起剪刀，默默地走了。</p>
<p>It was only twenty－four hours after Gabriel had left the farm that three men came running to report a disaster to Bathsheba.</p>
<p>就在盖伯瑞尔刚离开农场一天，三个人跑来向芭丝谢芭报告一起灾难。</p>
<p>‘Sixty of your sheep—’said Joseph Poorgrass，breathless.</p>
<p>“你的60只羊——”约瑟夫&middot;普格拉斯上气不接下气地说。</p>
<p>‘Have broken through throgh the gate said Billy，also breathless.</p>
<p>“冲坏了大门——”比利也上气不接下气地说。</p>
<p>‘And got into a field of young clover！’said Laban Tall.</p>
<p>“到了一片长着嫩三叶草的地里！”拉班&middot;托尔说。</p>
<p>‘They're eating the clover，and they're all swollen up！’</p>
<p>“羊正在吃三叶草，肚子都胀起来了！”</p>
<p>‘They'll all die if someone doesn't do something！’</p>
<p>“要是不想办法，他们会死的！”</p>
<p>‘Oh you fools！’cried Bathsheba. ‘Go straight to the field and get them out！’ She rushed towards the clover field，followed by the men. Her sheep were all lying down，their stomachs badly swollen. Joseph，Billy and Laban carried the sheep back into their own field，where the poor creatures lay helplessly without moving.</p>
<p>“哼，你们这帮蠢才！”芭丝谢芭嚷道。“快去地里，把羊弄出来！”她朝长着三叶草的地里跑去，后面跟着那几个人。她的羊肚子胀得鼓鼓的，全都躺着。约瑟夫、比利和拉班把羊扛回它们自己的地里，那些可怜的羊一动也不动地躺在那里。</p>
<p>‘Oh，what can I do，what can I do？’cried Bathsheba.</p>
<p>“哎呀，我该怎么办，我该怎么办？”芭丝谢芭大声地说着。</p>
<p>‘There's only one way of saving them，’said Laban.</p>
<p>“要救这些羊只有一个办法，”拉班说。</p>
<p>‘Soemeone must make a hole in the sheep's side，’explained Billy，‘with a special tool. Then the air comes out，and the sheep will survive. ’</p>
<p>“用一种特殊的工具在羊身体的一侧钻一个洞，”比利解释说，“肚子里的气出来，羊就有救了。”</p>
<p>‘Can you do it？Can I do it？’she asked wildly. ‘No，ma'am If it isn't done very carefully，the sheep will die Most shepherds can't even do it. ’ ‘Only one man in the area can do it，’said Joseph.</p>
<p>‘你会干吗？我会干吗？”她气急败坏地问。“不会，小姐。如果操作不当，羊会死的。大多数牧羊人也都干不了。”“这个地方只有一个人能干这个事，”约瑟夫说。</p>
<p>‘Who is he？Let's get him！’said his mistress.</p>
<p>“是谁？我们去找他！”女主人说。</p>
<p>‘It's Gabriel Oak. Ah，he's a clever man！’replied Joseph. ‘That's right，he certainly is，’agreed the other two. ‘How dare you say his name to me！’she said angrily.</p>
<p>“盖伯瑞尔&middot;奥克。他是个聪明的人！”约瑟夫回答说。“对，他是很聪明，”另外两人附和着说。“你们怎敢在我面前提他的名字！”她生气地说。</p>
<p>‘What about Farmer Boldwood？Perhaps he can do it？’</p>
<p>“农场主伯德伍德怎么样？也许他会？”</p>
<p>‘No，ma‘am，’answered Laban. ‘When his sheep ate some clover the other day，and were swollen just like these，he sent for Cabriel at once，and Gabriel saved their lives. ’</p>
<p>“不行，小姐，”拉班答道。“那天他的羊吃了三叶草，肚子鼓得也像这样，他立刻派人去请盖伯瑞尔，盖伯瑞尔把羊救活了。”</p>
<p>‘I don't care！Don't just stand there！Go and find someone！’cried Bathsheba. The men ran off，without any clear idea where they were going，and Bathsheba was left alone with her dying sheep. ‘Never will I send for him，never！’she promised herself.</p>
<p>“我不管这些！别站在那儿！去找个人来！”芭丝谢芭大声说。那几个人走了，并不知道该往哪里去。只剩下芭丝谢芭和她快死的羊。“我决不去请他，决不！”她暗自下决心。</p>
<p>One of the sheep jumped high in the air，fell heavily and did not move. It was dead. Bathsheba knew she must swallow her pride，and called to Laban，who was waiting at the gate.</p>
<p>一只羊跳了起来，重重地落在地上，不动了。羊死了。芭丝谢芭明白她必须收起她的自尊，她招呼等在大门口的拉班。</p>
<p>‘Take a horse，and go and find Gabriel，’she ordered. ‘Give him a message from me，that he must return at once. ’</p>
<p>“牵一匹马，去把盖伯瑞尔找来，”她命令说。“告诉他我说了他必须立刻回来。”</p>
<p>Bathsheba and her men waited miserably in the field. Several more sheep jumped wildly into the air，their stomachs horribly swollen and their muscles stiff，then died. At last a rider could be seen across the fields. But it was not Gabriel，it was Laban.</p>
<p>芭丝谢芭和她的雇工在地里苦苦地等着。又有几只羊抽疯似地跳了起来，它们的肚子鼓得可怕，肌肉僵硬，然后死了。终于，看到一个人骑着马穿过了田地。但却不是盖伯瑞尔，而是拉班。</p>
<p>‘He says he won't come unless you ask him politely，’Laban reported to Bathsheba.</p>
<p>“他说除非你客气地请他，否则他不回来，”拉班向芭丝谢芭报告说。</p>
<p>‘What！’said the young woman，opening her eyes wide. Joseph Poorgrass hid behind a tree in case she became violent. ‘How dare he answer me like that！’Another sheep fell dead. The men looked very serious，and did not offer their opinion. Bathsheba's eyes filled with tears，and she did not try to hide her anger and her injured pride.</p>
<p>“什么！”这年轻女人说，眼睛瞪得大大的。约瑟夫&middot;普格拉斯藏到了树后，害怕她会发作。“他怎么敢这样答复我！”又有一只羊落在地上死了。人们表情严肃，不发表意见。芭丝谢芭的眼里满是泪水。她并不想隐藏她的愤怒和受伤的自尊心。</p>
<p>‘Don't cry about it，miss，’suggested Billy sympathetically.</p>
<p>“别哭，小姐，”比利同情地建议说“干吗不用更客气的方式去请盖伯瑞尔呢？我敢保证他会来的。”</p>
<p>‘Why not ask Gabriel in a gentler way？I'm sure he'll come then. ’ ‘Oh，he's cruel to me！’said Bathsheba，drying her eyes. ‘But I'll beg him，yes，I'll have to！’She wrote a few words quickly on a piece of paper，and at the last moment added at the bottom：</p>
<p>“唉，他对我很冷酷！”芭丝谢芭擦干眼泪说。“我会恳求他，当然，我只能恳求他！”她在一张纸上很快地写了几个字，最后又在下边加了一句：</p>
<p>Gabriel，do not desert me！</p>
<p>盖伯瑞尔，别抛弃我！</p>
<p>She blushed a little as she wrote this，and gave the letter to Laban，who rode off again to find Gabriel.</p>
<p>写这个时，她脸红了。她把信给了拉班，拉班又骑马去找盖伯瑞尔去了。</p>
<p>When Gabriel arrived，Bathsheba knew from his expression which words in her note had made him come. He went straight to work on the swollen sheep，and managed to save almost all of them When he had finished，Bathsheba came to speak to him.</p>
<p>盖伯瑞尔来了，芭丝谢芭从他的表情得知是字条上的话促使他来的。他立即着手给那些肚子鼓胀的羊治病，差不多把所有的羊都救活了。他干完时，芭丝谢芭走过来跟他说话。</p>
<p>‘Gabriel，will you stay on with me？’she asked，smiling.</p>
<p>“盖伯瑞尔，你愿意继续留在我这儿吗？”她笑着问。</p>
<p>‘I will，’said Gabriel. And she smiled at him again.</p>
<p>“愿意，”盖伯瑞尔说。她又冲他笑笑。</p>
<p>A few days later the sheep－shearing began. The sheep were shorn every year at the beginning of June，and their wool was sold. The shearing was always done in the great barn，which had stood on the farm for four centuries. Today the sunshine poured in on the shearers. Bathsheba was watching them care－ fully to make sure that the sheep were not injured，and that all the wool was cut off Gabriel was the most experienced shearer. He loved being watched by Bathsheba，and felt warm with pride when she congratulated him on his speed.</p>
<p>几天后，开始剪羊毛了。每年六月初剪羊毛，然后把羊毛卖掉。剪羊毛总是在巨大的仓房进行，这个仓房在农场已有四百年了。这一天，阳光照在剪羊毛的人的身上。芭丝谢芭仔细地看着他们，她要确保羊没有被伤着，而且羊毛也剪干净了。盖伯瑞尔剪得最熟练。他很愿意让芭丝谢芭看着，当她祝贺他剪得快时，他感到无比自豪。</p>
<p>But he was not happy for long Farmer Boldwood arrived at the door of the barn，and spoke to Bathsheba. They stepped outside into the bright sunlight to carry on their conversation. Gabriel could not hear what they were saying，but noticed that Bathsheba was blushing. He continued shearing，feeling sud－ denly very sad. Bathsheba went back to the house，and returned a short while later in her new green riding dress. She and Boldwood were obviously going for a ride together. As Gabriel's concentration was broken for a moment，his shears cut the sheep's skin. Bathsheba，at the door of the barn，noticed the animal jump，and saw the blood.</p>
<p>不过，他没高兴多久。农场主伯德伍德来到了仓房门口，和芭丝谢芭说话。他们走出去，在灿烂的阳光下继续着他们的谈话。盖伯瑞尔听不到他们在说什么，但他注意到芭丝谢芭脸红了。他继续剪着羊毛，突然感到很沮丧。芭丝谢芭回到屋里，片刻又返身出来，穿着崭新的绿色骑马服。她显然要与伯德伍德一起去骑马。由于盖伯瑞尔注意力不集中，他的剪子剪到了羊的皮肉。在仓房门口的芭丝谢芭注意到那只牲畜跳了一下，也看到了血。</p>
<p>‘Oh Gabriel！’she said. ‘Be more careful！’Gabriel knew she was aware that she herself had indirectly caused the poor sheep's wound. But he bravely hid his hurt feelings，and watched Boldwood and Bathsheba ride away，feeling as sure as the other workers that the couple would soon be married.</p>
<p>“喂，盖伯瑞尔！”她说。“当心点！”盖伯瑞尔知道芭丝谢芭意识到她自己是这只可怜的羊受伤的间接原因。盖伯瑞尔坚强地藏起自己受伤的感情，看着伯德伍德和芭丝谢芭一同骑马走了，像其他雇工一样确信这一对很快就会结婚。</p><a href='9.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
