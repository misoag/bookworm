<p><b>9 芭丝谢芭遇到一位英俊的士兵 </b></p>
<p>Farmers always gave a special supper to the sheep shearers when they had finished their work. This year Bathsheba had ordered her maids to put a long table in the garden，with the top end of the table just inside the house. The farm workers took their seats，and she sat at the top of the table，so that she was with them，but a little apart. There was an empty place at the bottom of the table. At first she asked Gabriel to sit there，but just then Mr Boldwood arrived， apologizing for his lateness.</p>
<p>农场主们在剪羊毛的人剪完羊毛后，总要设宴款待他们一次。今年，芭丝谢芭命令女仆们在院子里摆了一张长桌子，桌子的上端在屋子里。雇工们入了座，她在主座上坐下。这样，她和他们既坐在一起，又保持一点距离。在桌子的尾端空着一个位子。起初，芭丝谢芭让盖伯瑞尔坐在那里，但伯德伍德刚好来了，抱歉地说他来晚了。</p>
<p>‘Gabriel，’said Bathsheba，‘will you move again please， and let Mr Boldwood sit there？’Gabriel moved away in silence to another seat. They all ate and drank，and celebrated the end of the sheep－shearing by singing their favourite songs. Mr Boldwood seemed unusually cheerful，and at the end of the meal he left his seat and went to join Bathsheba at her end of the table，just inside the sitting-room . It was growing dark，but Gabriel and the other men could not avoid noticing how Boldwood looked at her. It was clear that the middle－aged farmer was deeply in love.</p>
<p>“盖伯瑞尔，”芭丝谢芭说，“请你再动一下，让伯德伍德先生坐在那里好吗？”盖伯瑞尔默默地移到了另一个座位上。人们一边吃喝，一边唱着自己喜爱的歌曲，庆祝剪羊毛的结束。伯德伍德好像异常兴奋，宴会快结束时，他离开他的座位，到位于起居室的桌子上端，和芭丝谢芭坐在了一起。天渐渐黑了，盖伯瑞尔和其他人都注意到伯德伍德看芭丝谢芭的样子。很显然，这位中年农场主坠入了情网。</p>
<p>After a while Bathsheba said goodnight to her farm workers，and closed the sitting－room door and windows. Now she and Boldwood were alone. Kneeling in front of her，he took her hands.</p>
<p>过了一会儿，芭丝谢芭和她的雇工道别，关上了起居室的门和窗户。现在，只剩下她和伯德伍德。他跪在她的面前，握住她的手。</p>
<p>‘Tell me，tell me what you've decided！’he begged. ‘I'll try to love you，’she answered in a trembling voice. ‘And if you think I'll make a good wife，I'll agree to marry you But，Mr Boldwood，any woman would hesitate before deciding on something as important as marriage. Could you wait a few weeks until I'm sure？’</p>
<p>“告诉我，告诉我你的决定！”他恳求地说。“我将尽量爱你，”她用颤抖的声音回答。“如果你觉得我会是一个好妻子，我会同意和你结婚。可是，伯德伍德先生，任何女人在决定像婚姻这样的大事时，都会犹豫的。在我决定之前，你能等几个星期吗？”</p>
<p>‘I'll be away on business for five or six weeks anyway. Do you really think that by that time you will…’</p>
<p>“我由于业务上的事会离开五、六个星期。你真的觉得那时你会……”</p>
<p>‘I feel almost sure that when you come back，at harvest time，I'll be able to promise to marry you. But，remember，I can't promise yet. ’</p>
<p>“我几乎敢肯定你在收割季节回来时，我就能答应和你结婚。不过，记住，我现在不能许诺。”</p>
<p>‘I don't ask for anything more. I can wait. Goodnight， Miss Everdene！’And he left her. Bathsheba now realized how thoughtlessly she had behaved towards him，and understood how deeply he loved her. She was very sorry for her mistake and was therefore punishing herself by agreeing to marry him.</p>
<p>“我不要求别的。我可以等待。晚安，伊芙丁小姐！”他们分手了。芭丝谢芭现在意识到她当初的举动是多么的轻率，她也明白他是多么深地爱着自己。她对自己所犯的错误非常内疚，因此，想以与他结婚来惩罚自己。</p>
<p>That evening she went round the farm as usual，lighting her lamp whenever necessary，to check that all the animals were safe. On her way back，she was walking along the narrow public path which led to her house. It was very dark there， among the trees，and she was a little surprised to hear some footsteps coming towards her. It was unfortunate that she would meet the traveller at the darkest point of the path. As she was about to pass the dark shape，something seemed to attach her skirt to the ground，and she had to stop ‘What's happened？Have I hurt you，friend？'a man asked.</p>
<p>那天晚上，她像通常一样到农场各处去查看是否所有的牲口都安然无恙。她不时地把灯点着。回去的时候，她沿着一条能通到她的屋子的小路走着。小路从树林中穿过，所以很黑。听到有脚步声走来，她有点吃惊。糟糕的是她与这位旅行者相遇的地方恰好是路上最黑的地方。她正要与那个黑色人影擦肩而过时，地面上有什么东西挂住了她的裙子，她只好站祝“怎么了？我伤着你了吗，朋友？”一个男人的声音问。</p>
<p>‘No，’said Bathsheba，trying to pull her skirt away.</p>
<p>“没有，”芭丝谢芭说，使劲地扯裙子。</p>
<p>‘Ah！You're a lady！The spur on my boot has got tied up with your dress. Have you got a lamp？I'll light it for you. ’</p>
<p>“噢，是一位女士！我靴子上的马刺把你的裙子缠住了。你有灯吗？我给你照着。”</p>
<p>The light from the lamp shone suddenly on a handsome young man in a bright red and gold army uniform. He looked admiringly at Bathsheba.</p>
<p>灯光照在一个英俊的年轻人身上，他身穿大红色和金色相间的军装。他赞赏地看着芭丝谢芭。</p>
<p>‘Thank you for letting me see such a beautiful face！’he said.</p>
<p>“谢谢你让我看到一张如此美丽的面庞！”他说。</p>
<p>‘I didn't want to show it to you，’she said coldly， blushing. ‘Please undo your spur quickly！’He bent down to pull rather lazily at his boots. ‘You are making it even worse，’she accused him angrily，‘to keep me here longer！’</p>
<p>“我不想让你看我的脸，”她冷冷地说，红了脸。“请你赶快松开你的马刺！”他弯腰慢慢地拉他的靴子。“你把事情搞得更糟了，”她生气地指责，“让我在这儿呆这么久！”</p>
<p>‘Oh no，surely not，’smiled the soldier. ‘Don't be angry. I was doing it so that I could have the pleasure of apologizing to such a lovely woman. ’ Bathsheba had no idea what to say. She wondered whether to escape by pulling the material away，but did not want to tear her best dress.</p>
<p>“噢，不，我没有那个意思，”土兵笑着说。“别生气。我这样做就有机会向一位可爱的女人道歉，这是我很乐意做的。”芭丝谢芭不知说什么好。她在想是否该拽出裙子，赶快走开，可她不想撕坏自己最好的裙子。</p>
<p>‘I've seen many women in my life，’continued the young man，staring into her face，‘but I've never seen a woman as beautiful as you. I don't care if you're offended，that's the truth. ’</p>
<p>“我一生中见过许多女人，”年轻人盯着她，继续说，“但我从未见过像你一样漂亮的女子。我不在乎你是否生气，我说的是实话。”</p>
<p>‘Who are you，then，if you don't care who you offend？’</p>
<p>“如果你不在意你惹了谁，那你是谁呢？”</p>
<p>‘People know me in Weatherbury. My name's Sergeant Troy. Ah，you see，your skirt's free now！I wish you and I had been tied together for ever！’</p>
<p>“威瑟伯里的人都认识我，我是托伊中士。你看，裙子解开了！我真希望我和你能永远拴在一起！”</p>
<p>She pulled her dress quickly away from his spurs，and ran up the path and into her house. The next day she discovered from Liddy that Sergeant Troy's supposed father was a doctor，but people said his real father was a nobleman. He had been brought up in Weatherbury，and was well known as a young soldier with a great interest in girls. Bathsheba could not remain angry for long with someone who admired her as much as he obviously did. It was unfortunate that Boldwood，when courting her，had forgotten to tell her，even once，that she was beautiful.</p>
<p>她迅速把裙子从马刺上拉开，沿着路跑回了屋里。第二天，芭丝谢芭从利蒂那里得知托伊中士所谓的父亲是一个医生，人们说他真正的父亲是个贵族。他在威瑟伯里长大，人人都知道他是个对女孩子有极大兴趣的年轻士兵。对于一个像他这样明显地赞赏自己的人，芭丝谢芭不会生他的气。多么遗憾，伯德伍德在追求她时，一次也没提起她长得漂亮。</p>
<p>Sergeant Troy was certainly an unusual man. He lived only in the present，caring nothing for the past or the future. Because he never expected anything，he was never disappoint－ed. To men he usually told the truth，but to women，never. He was intelligent and well－educated， and proud of his success with women.</p>
<p>托伊中士当然不是一般的人，他只管眼前，不考虑过去和将来。由于他从不期望什么，所以他也从未失望过。对男人，他是讲真话的，但对女人，却从没有一句实话。他聪明，受过良好的教育，对自己在女人方面所取得的成功很自豪。</p>
<p>A week or two after the sheep－shearing，Bathsheba was in the hayfields，where her workers were cutting the hay. She was surprised to see a bright red figure appear from behind a cart. Sergeant Troy had come to help on the farm. She blushed as the young soldier came to speak to her.</p>
<p>在剪完羊毛一、两周后，芭丝谢芭正在干草地里，她的雇工们正在割草。她很惊讶地看到马车后面走出一个红色的人影。托伊中士来到农场帮忙。当年轻士兵走上前来和她讲话时，她红了脸。</p>
<p>‘Miss Everdene！’he said. ‘I didn't realize it was the “Queen of Casterbridge market”I was speaking to the other night. I apologize for expressing my feelings so strongly to you 102 then. Of course，I'm not a stranger here. I often helped your uncle on the farm，and now I'm helping you. ’</p>
<p>“伊芙丁小姐！”他说。“我没有意识到那天晚上和我讲话的是‘卡斯特桥市场的女王’。我为自己当时露骨的表白道歉。当然，我在这儿也不是外人。我过去常帮你叔叔在农场干活，现在我帮你。”</p>
<p>‘I suppose I must thank you for that，’replied the Queen of Casterbridge market rather ungratefully.</p>
<p>“既然如此，那我得谢谢你了，”卡斯特桥市场的女王不领情地说。</p>
<p>‘You're cross because I was honest when I spoke to you that night. But I couldn't look at you，and say you aren't beautiful！’</p>
<p>“你因为那天晚上我对你说了实话生气了。可我不能看着你，说你不漂亮！”</p>
<p>‘You are pretending，Sergeant Troy！’said Bathsheba，laughing in spite of herself at his clever way of talking.</p>
<p>“托伊中士，你在说谎！”芭丝谢芭为他聪明的谈话方式忍不住笑起来。</p>
<p>‘No，Miss Everdene，you must let me say how lovely you are！What's wrong with that？’</p>
<p>“没有，伊芙丁小姐，你一定要允许我说你是多么地漂亮！这有什么错呢？”</p>
<p>‘It's wrong because—it isn't true，’she said，hesitating.</p>
<p>“有错，因为这不是真的，”她有点犹豫地说。</p>
<p>‘But you know that everybody notices how beautiful you are，don't you？’</p>
<p>“你心里清楚人们都注意到你是多么的漂亮，难道不是吗？”</p>
<p>‘Well，no—that is，I've heard Liddy say they do，but…’She paused. She had never intended to become involved in this kind of conversation with the soldier，but somehow he had trapped her into replying. Thank you for helping the men with the hay， she continued. ‘But please don't speak to me again. ’</p>
<p>“不，我只听利蒂说过人们都这么说，可是……”她不说了，她根本没想过跟这个士兵谈论这个，是他设计让她回答这个问题。“谢谢你帮着割草，”她接着说。“别再跟我讲话了。”</p>
<p>‘Oh Miss Bathsheba！That's too hard！I won't be here long. I'm going back to the army in a month. ’</p>
<p>“欧，芭丝谢芭小姐！这太不近人情了！我在这儿呆不了多久。我一个月后就要回军队去。”</p>
<p>‘But you don't really care about a word from me，do you？</p>
<p>“我说话对你根本无所谓，不是吗？”</p>
<p>‘I do，Miss Everdene. Perhaps you think it's foolish of me to want just a “good morning”，but you have never loved a beautiful woman like yourself，as I do. ’</p>
<p>“不，伊芙丁小姐，我只听一声‘早安’就满足了，也许你觉得这样很傻，但你从未像我一样爱上一个你这样漂亮的女人。”</p>
<p>‘But you only saw me the other night！I don't believe you could fall in love so fast. I won't listen to you any more. I wish I knew what time it was. I've spent too much time with you.</p>
<p>“可你只是那天晚上才见到我！我不信你这么快就会爱上我。我不想听你再说下去。我希望我知道现在几点了。我跟你呆的时间太长了。”</p>
<p>‘Haven't you got a watch，miss？I'll give you one，’and he handed her a heavy gold watch. ‘That watch belonged to a nobleman，my father，and is all the inheritance I have. ’</p>
<p>“你没表吗，小姐？我给你一块，”他递给她一块沉甸甸的金表。“这块表属于一个贵族，我的父亲，是我继承的全部财产。”</p>
<p>‘But Sergeant Troy，I can't take this！It's your father’s，and so valuable！’said Bathsheba，horrified.</p>
<p>“托伊中士，我不能要这块表！这是你父亲的，而且如此珍贵！”芭丝谢芭惊恐地说。</p>
<p>‘I loved my father，true，but I love you more. ’The young man was not pretending now，as he looked at Bathsheba's beautiful，excited face.</p>
<p>“我爱我的父亲，这不假，可我更爱你。”这个年轻人看着芭丝谢芭美丽、激动的面庞，不无真情地说。</p>
<p>‘Can it be true，that you love me？You have seen so little of me！Please take it back！’</p>
<p>“你爱我，这会是真的吗？你根本就没见过我几次！请你把这块表拿回去！”</p>
<p>‘Wll then，I'll take it，’he said，‘because it's all I have to prove that I come of good family. But will you speak to me while I'm in Weatherbury？Will you let me work in your fields？’</p>
<p>“既然如此，我就不给你了，”他说，“它是证实我出身高贵的唯一的东西。我在威瑟伯里这段时期你会跟我讲话吗？你会让我在你的地里干活吗？”</p>
<p>‘Yes！Or no，I don't know！Oh，why did you come and disturb me like this！’</p>
<p>“会的！也许不会，我不知道！唉，你为什么要来这样打扰我呢！”</p>
<p>‘Perhaps，in setting a trap，I've caught myself. Such things sometimes happen. Goodbye，Miss Everdene！’</p>
<p>“也许是为了设陷阶，我把自己陷住了。这种事情有时也会发生。再见，伊芙丁小姐！”</p>
<p>Blushing and almost crying，Bathsheba hurried home，whis-pering to herself，‘Oh what have I done？What does it mean？I wish I knew how much of what he says is true！</p>
<p>芭丝谢芭红着脸，差不多都要哭了，匆忙回到了家。她低声自语着，“唉，我都干了些什么？这意味着什么？我希望我知道他说的有多少是真话！”</p><a href='10.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
