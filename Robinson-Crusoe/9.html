<p><b>9 英国的家 </b></p>
<p>When I came back to England，I felt like a stranger in the country. Many things were different，and not many people remembered me. I went home to York，but my fa-ther and mother were dead，and also my two brothers. I did find the two sons of one of my brothers. They were happy to learn that I was alive，and I was pleased to find some family.</p>
<p>当我回到英格兰，我觉得自己好像是这个国家的一个陌生客人。许多东西都变了样，没有几个人能记得我。我回到约克郡的家，我的父母亲及我两个兄弟都已去世了。我找到了我一个兄弟的两个儿子。知道我还活着他们非常高兴，我很高兴找到了一些家人。</p>
<p>After some months I decided to go down to Lisbon in Portu-gal. I had friends there who could help me to sell my land in Brazil，and I needed the money. Friday came with me. He was always a good and true friend to me. In Lisbon I found the Portuguese captain，who took me in his ship to Brazil，all those years ago. It was good to see him again，and he helped me with my business. Soon I was ready to go home again—by land. No more adventures and dangers by sea for me！</p>
<p>过了几个月我决定去葡萄牙的里斯本。我有些朋友在那儿可以帮我卖掉在巴西的土地，我需要钱。星期五和我一起去。他一直是我的一位忠实的好朋友。在里斯本我找到了多年前带我去巴西的葡萄牙船长。再次见到他真是太好了，他帮助我做生意。不久我又准备回家——是经陆路。对我来说在海上航行已没有更多的冒险和危险。</p>
<p>It was a long，hard journey. We had to cross the mountains between Spain and France in winter，and the snow was deep. Poor Friday was very afraid of the snow. In his country it was always hot，and he did not like cold weather.</p>
<p>这是一次长途跋涉的旅行。我们不得不在冬天穿越位于西班牙和法国之间的大山，积雪很深。可怜的星期五非常害怕雪。在他的国家天气总是很热，他不喜欢寒冷的天气。</p>
<p>Back in England I found a house and began to live a quiet life. My two nephews came to live with me. The younger one wanted to be a sailor，and so I found him a place on a ship. Af-ter a while I married，and had three children，two sons and a daughter. Then my wife died，and my nephew，who was now the captain of a ship，came home to see me. He knew that I did not really like a quiet life.</p>
<p>回到英国我找了座房子，开始过平静的生活。我的两个侄子来和我住在一起。小的一个想做一名水手，于是我给他在船上找了个职位。过了不久我结婚了，生了三个孩子，两个儿子和一个女儿。后来我的妻子去世了，我的那个侄子回家看我，他现在已当了船长。他知道我并不真正喜欢平静的生活。</p>
<p>'I have a fine ship，uncle，'he said. 'I'm going out to the East Indies-India，Malaya，the Philippines…Why don't you come with me？'</p>
<p>“我有一艘好船，叔叔，”他说，“我将去东印度——印度、马来西亚、菲律宾……为什么你不同我一起去呢？”</p>
<p>And so，in 1694，I went to sea again，and had many more ad-ventures. Perhaps one day I'll write another book about them.</p>
<p>于是，1694年，我再次出海，有了更多冒险的经历。或许有一天我会另外写一本关于它们的书。</p></body></html>
