<p><b>2 南下非洲海岸 </b></p>
<p>For two long years I lived the life of a slave. I worked in escape，but it was never possible. I thought about it day and night. My master liked to go fishing in a little boat，and he al-ways took me with him. A man called Moely，and a young boy also went with us.</p>
<p>两年多的时间里，我过着奴隶的生活，我在屋子里、花园里干活，每天都计划着逃跑，但一直没能成功。我日夜思考着逃跑的事。我的主人喜欢乘小船去钓鱼，而且总是带上我。一个名叫莫雷的男人及一个小男孩也总跟随着我们。</p>
<p>One day my master said to us，'Some of my friends want to go fishing tomorrow. Get the boat ready. '</p>
<p>一天主人对我们说：“我有些朋友明天想去钓鱼，把船给准备好。”</p>
<p>So we put a lot of food and drink on the boat，and the next morning，we waited for my master and his friends. But when my master arrived，he was alone.</p>
<p>于是，我们搬了很多食物和饮料到船上，在第二天早上，我们等候着主人和他的朋友，但主人来时却是他独自一人。</p>
<p>'My friends don't want to go fishing today，'he said to me. 'But you go with Moely and the boy，and catch some fish for our supper tonight. '</p>
<p>“我的朋友今天不想去钓鱼了，”他对我说，“但你和莫雷及这孩子去为我们今天的晚餐捕些鱼来。”</p>
<p>'Yes，master，'I answered quietly，but inside I was excited. 'Perhaps now I can escape，'I said to myself.</p>
<p>“是，主人。”我平静地回答，但我内心很激动。心想，“也许这回我可以逃脱了。”</p>
<p>My master went back to his friends and we took the boat out to sea. For a time we fished quietly，and then I moved carefully behind Moely and knocked him into the water. 'Swim！'I cried. 'Swim to the shore！'</p>
<p>主人回到他的朋友们那儿去了，我们坐船出了海。静静地钓了一阵鱼，然后我小心翼翼地移到莫雷的身后把他推到了海里。“游回去，”我大声喊着“朝岸上游！”</p>
<p>My master liked to shoot seabirds and so there were guns on the boat. Quickly，I took one of these guns. Moely was swim－ming after the boat and I shouted to him：</p>
<p>我的主人喜欢打海鸟，所以有几只枪在船上。我迅速地抓过一支枪，莫雷正跟在船后面游，我朝他叫道：</p>
<p>Go back to the shore！You can swim there—it's not too far. I won't hurt you，but if you come near the boat，I'll shoot you through the head！'So Moely turned，and swam back to the shore as quickly as he could.</p>
<p>“回到岸上去！你可以游到那儿，这儿离海岸不太远。我不会伤害你，但如果你一靠近这只船，我就会打穿你的睑袋！”于是，莫雷转过身尽他最快的速度游回岸上去了。</p>
<p>Then I said to the boy，'Xury，if you help me，I'll be a good friend to you. If you don't help me，I'll push you into the sea too. '</p>
<p>然后，我对这小孩说：“苏里，如果你帮我，我会是你的好朋友，如果你不帮我，我同样会把你丢到海里去。”</p>
<p>But Xury was happy to help me. 'I'll go all over the world with you，'he cried.</p>
<p>但苏里很乐意帮助我。“我愿意跟着你走遍世界，”他大声说。</p>
<p>I wanted to sail to the Canary Islands，but I was afraid to go too far from the shore. It was only a small boat. And so we sailed on south for some days. We had very little water，and it was dangerous country here，with many wild animals. We were afraid，but we often had to go on shore to get more water. Once I used a gun to shoot a wild animal. I don't know what animal it was，but it made a good meal.</p>
<p>我想驶向加纳利岛，但是不敢远离海岸，这只是一只小船。因此我们向南航行了几天，我们只有很少的水，这儿是危险的国度，有许多野生动物。我们害怕，但是我们常常不得不上岸去取水，有一次我用枪射死了一只野兽，我不知道这是什么动物，但它成了一顿美餐。</p>
<p>For about ten or twelve days we sailed on south，down the coast of Africa. Then one day we saw some people on the shore—strange，wild people，who did not look friendly. By now we had very little food，and We really needed help. we were afraid，but we had to go on shore.</p>
<p>沿着非洲海岸我们朝南航行了大约10天至12天，随后一天我们看到岸上有些人——古怪的野人，他们看起来并不友善，那时我们的食物很少了，我们实在需要帮助，我们害怕，但我们不得不上岸。</p>
<p>At first，they were afraid of us，too. Perhaps white people never visited this coast. We did not speak their language，of course，so we used our hands and faces to show that we were hungry. They came with food for us，but then they moved away quickly. We carried the food to our boat，and they watched us. I tried to thank them，but I had nothing to give them.</p>
<p>开始，他们也害怕我们。或许白人从没有访问过这海岸。当然，我们不会说他们的语言，我们只好用手势和脸部表情来表明我们很饿。他们把食物搬给我们，随即迅速地离开。我们把食物搬上船，他们瞧着我们。我试图感谢他们，却没有什么东西可以送给他们。</p>
<p>Just then two big wild cats came down to the shore from the mountains. I think they were leopards. The people were afraid of these wild cats，and the women cried out. Quickly，I took a gun，and shot one of the animals. The second wild cat ran back up into the mountains.</p>
<p>正在这时候，两只大野猫从山上窜到海边来。我想它们是豹子。那些人们害怕这些野猫，那些妇女们尖叫起来。很快地，我拿起一枝枪，击中了其中一只野兽。另外一只跑回了山里。</p>
<p>Guns were new to these African people，and they were afraid of the loud noise and the smoke. But they were happy about the dead wild cat. I gave them the meat of the dead animal，and they gave us more food and water.</p>
<p>枪对这些非洲居民来说很新奇，他们害怕这轰响的声音与烟雾。但他们对死的野猫很感兴趣。我送给他们这只死兽的肉，他们给了我们更多的食物和水。</p>
<p>We now had a lot of food and water，and we sailed on. Eleven days later we came near the Cape Verde Islands. We could see them，but we couldn't get near because there was no wind. We waited.</p>
<p>现在我们有了很多的食物和水，我们继续航行。11天后我们接近佛得角群岛。我们可以看见它们，但由于没有风我们不能靠近。我们等候着。</p>
<p>Suddenly Xury called to me，'Look，a ship！'</p>
<p>突然，苏里对我叫着，“看哪，一只船！”</p>
<p>He was right！We called and shouted and sailed our little boat as fast as we could. But the ship did not see us. Then I re-membered the guns which made a lot of smoke. A few minutes later the ship saw us and turned.</p>
<p>他是对的！我们叫喊着并且尽可能快地划着小船。但是那只船并没看到我们。这时我想起枪可以产生很多烟雾。几分钟后那只船看到了我们并且转了过来。</p>
<p>When we were on the ship，the Portuguese captain listened to my story. He was going to Brazil and agreed to help me，but he wanted nothing for his help. 'No，'he said，when I tried to pay him. 'Perhaps，one day，someone will help me when I need it. '</p>
<p>等我们上了他们的船，葡萄牙船长倾听了我的故事。他正要去巴西并且答应帮助我，但他对我的帮助不要任何偿报。当我试图付钱给他时，他说：“不，也许，有一天，当我需要帮助时，有人也会帮助我。”</p>
<p>But he gave me money for my boat，and for Xury，too. At first，I did not want to sell Xury as a slave，after all our danger-ous adventures together. But Xury was happy to go to the cap-tain，and the captain was a good man. 'In ten years'time，'he said，'Xury can go free. '</p>
<p>但是他却付钱买下我的船，也买下了苏里。起初，我不愿意把苏里卖作奴隶，毕竟一起经历了我们所有危险的冒险过程。但苏里很乐意跟随船长，这位船长是一个好人。“十年后，”他说，“苏里将会获得自由”。</p>
<p>When we arrived in Brazil three weeks later，I said goodbye to the captain and Xury，left the ship，and went to begin a new life.</p>
<p>三星期后我们抵达巴西，我告别了船长和苏里，离开了船。继续开始了一个新的生活。</p><a href='3.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
