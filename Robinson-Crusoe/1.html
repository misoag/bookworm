<p><b>1 我的第一次海上旅行 </b></p>
<p>Before I begin my story，I would like to tell you a little about myself.</p>
<p>开始我的故事之前，我想先向你谈一点我自己的情况。</p>
<p>I was born in the year 1632，in the city of York in the north of England. My father was German，but he came to live and work in England. Soon after that，he married my mother，who was English. Her family name was Robinson，so，when I was born，they called me Robinson，after her.</p>
<p>我1632年出生在英国北部的约克郡。我父亲是德国人，但他却来到英国居住和工作。此后不久，他与我母亲结了婚。我母亲是英国人，娘家姓鲁宾孙，因此，我出生后他们都称呼我鲁宾孙，沿用了我母亲的姓氏。</p>
<p>My father did well in his business and I went to a good school. He wanted me to get a good job and live a quiet，com-fortable life. But I didn't want that. I wanted adventure and an exciting life.</p>
<p>我父亲在生意上做得很出色，并且我也进了一所好学校。他希望我得到好的工作，过一种平静的、舒适的生活。但是我不希望如此。我喜欢冒险和刺激的生活。</p>
<p>'I want to be a sailor and go to sea，'I told my mother and father. They were very unhappy about this.</p>
<p>“我想成为一名水手去航行，”我告诉父母亲。他们对此很不高兴。</p>
<p>'Please don't go，'my father said. 'You won't be happy，you know. Sailors have a difficult and dangerous life. 'And be－cause I loved him，and he was unhappy，I tried to forget about the sea.</p>
<p>“不要去，”父亲说。“你不会幸福的，你知道。水手过着艰苦而且危险的生活。”因为我爱父亲，他不高兴，我便试图忘掉大海。</p>
<p>But I couldn't forget，and about a year later，I saw a friend in town. His father had a ship，and my friend said to me，'We're sailing to London tomorrow. Why don't you come with us？'</p>
<p>但我不可能忘掉，大约一年后，我在镇里遇到一个朋友。他的父亲有一艘船，我的朋友对我说，“明天我们航行去伦敦。你为什么不和我们一起走呢？”</p>
<p>And so，on September 1st，1651，I went to Hull，and the next day we sailed for London.</p>
<p>于是，1651年9月1日，我到了赫尔港，第二天我们驶向伦敦。</p>
<p>But，a few days later，there was a strong wind. The sea was rough and dangerous，and the ship went up and down，up and down. I was very ill，and very afraid.</p>
<p>但是，几天后，刮起了狂风，狂暴的大海危机四伏，船不断颠簸。我晕船晕得厉害，非常害怕。</p>
<p>'Oh，I don't want to die！'I cried. 'I want to live！If I live，I'll go home and never go to sea again！'</p>
<p>“哦，我不想死！”我哭喊起来。“我想活着！假如我活着，我就要回家，再也不出海了！”</p>
<p>The next day the wind dropped，and the sea was quiet and be autiful again.</p>
<p>第二天，风停了，大海又重新恢复了平静而美丽。</p>
<p>'Well，Bob，'my friend laughed. 'How do you feel now？The wind wasn't too bad. '</p>
<p>“好了，鲍伯，”我的朋友笑着说。“现在你感觉如何？这风并不太令人讨厌。”</p>
<p>'What！'I cried. 'It was a terrible storm. '</p>
<p>“什么！”我大叫起来。“这可是一场可怕的风暴。”</p>
<p>'Oh，that wasn't a storm，'my friend answered. 'Just a lit－tle wind. Forget it. Come and have a drink. '</p>
<p>“哦，这不算风暴，”我的朋友回答。“仅仅是小风而已。忘记它吧，来，喝一杯。”</p>
<p>After a few drinks with my friend，I felt better. I forgot about the danger and decided not to go home. I didn't want my friends and family to laugh at me！</p>
<p>和朋友喝了几杯，我感觉好多了。我忘记了危险，决定不回家了。我不愿意我的朋友和家人嘲笑我！</p>
<p>I stayed in London for some time，but I still wanted to go to sea. So，when the captain of a ship asked me to go with him to Guinea in Africa，I agreed. And so I went to sea for the second time.</p>
<p>我在伦敦停留了一段时间，但我仍然想去航行。所以，当一位船长要求我和他一起去非洲的几内亚时，我答应了。于是，我第二次去航海。</p>
<p>It was a good ship and everything went well at first，but I was very ill again. Then，when we were near the Canary Is-lands，a Turkish pirate ship came after us. They were famous thieves of the sea at that time. There was a long，hard fight，but when it finished，we and the ship were prisoners.</p>
<p>这是一艘好船，开始一切都很顺利，但是我又晕得厉害。此后，当我们接近加纳利群岛时，一艘土耳其海盗船跟上了我们。他们是当时有名的海盗。经过一场长时间激烈的交火，一切都结束时，我们连人带船都成了俘虏。</p>
<p>The Turkish captain and his men took us to Sallee in Moroc－co. They wanted to sell us as slaves in the markets there. But in the end the Turkish captain decided to keep me for himself，and took me home with him. This was a sudden and terrible change in my life. I was now a slave and this Turkish captain was my master.</p>
<p>土耳其船长和他的部下把我们带到摩洛哥的萨利。他们想在那儿的市场上把我们当作奴隶卖掉。但最后土耳其船长决定把我留给他自己，带我随他回家。这是我一生中一次突然的可怕的变故。现在我成了奴隶，这位土耳其船长是我的主人。</p><a href='2.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
