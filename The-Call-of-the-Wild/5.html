<p><b>5 更艰苦的工作 </b></p>
<p>Thirty days after leaving Dawson City， the team arrived back in Skagway． They were very， very tired Buck now weighed only fifty kilograms， and the other dogs were also very thin．</p>
<p>离开道桑镇30天后，队伍回到了斯开格威。他们筋疲力荆巴克瘦得只剩下50公斤，别的狗也是瘦骨伶仃。</p>
<p>They were not ill； they just needed a long， long rest． But at Skagway there were mountains of letters waiting to go north，so the men had to buy new， strong dogs The old ones， now useless for work， were sold．</p>
<p>他们并没有生病，只是需要一个长长的休息。但是在斯开格威还有堆积如山的信等着运到北方。所以人们买了更强壮的狗，以前的狗因为对工作没有用，被卖掉了。</p>
<p>Two American men， called Hal and Charles， bought Buck and his team， together with the harness． Charles was forty years old， with light hair and watery blue eyes． Hal was a young man of twenty with a big shiny gun and a big knife in his belt ．These things， more than anything， showed how young he was Both men were clearly new to the north， and its hard and dangerous life．</p>
<p>两个美国人，哈尔和查尔斯，连同挽具买下了巴克和他的队伍。查尔斯大约40岁左右，浅色的头发，有一双水汪汪的蓝眼睛。哈尔20岁上下，皮带上别着一把闪光的大枪和一把大刀。这两样东西比任何东西都能显示他的幼稚。这两个人显然对北方和它艰苦危险的生活茫然无知。</p>
<p>They took the dogs back to their untidy camp， where a woman was waiting ．This was Mercedes—Charles's wife and Hal's sister．</p>
<p>他们把狗带回凌乱的帐篷，有一个女人正等在那里。她是查尔斯的妻子，哈尔的姐姐，叫玛尔赛蒂。</p>
<p>Buck watched the men take down the tent and load all their luggage on the sledge． They didn't know how to do it sensibly， and every time they put something on the sledge，Mercedes moved it． Often they had to take things off the sledge and start again．</p>
<p>巴克冷眼瞧着他们拆掉帐篷，把所有的东西都放到雪撬上。他们不懂得如何把东西有条理地安置好。而且更糟的是，每一次刚把东西放到雪撬上，玛尔赛蒂就动手移开它。所以他们常常不得不把东西搬下来重新开始。</p>
<p>Three men came up and watched， laughing</p>
<p>3个男人走上前看到这情景，笑了起来。</p>
<p>‘You've got a heavy load on that sledge，’ said one of them ‘Why don't you leave the tent here in Skagway？’</p>
<p>“你们放在雪撬上的东西太沉了，”其中一个人说道，“你们干嘛不把帐篷留在斯开格威？”</p>
<p>‘How could we live without a tent？’ asked Mercedes，throwing up her hands in the air．</p>
<p>“没有帐篷我们怎么活下去呢？”玛尔赛蒂问道，向空中伸出双手。</p>
<p>‘It's spring now．You won't have any more cold weather．’</p>
<p>“春天来了，天气不会再冷啦。”</p>
<p>‘I must have a tent，’she answered， and helped Charles and Hal with the last few boxes．</p>
<p>“我可不能没有帐篷。”她答道，帮着查尔斯和哈尔搬着最后几只箱子。</p>
<p>‘Do you think that load will stay on？’asked another man．</p>
<p>“你那些东西装的不太稳当吧？”另一个人说。</p>
<p>‘Why shouldn't it？’ asked Charles．</p>
<p>“这为什么呢？”查尔斯问。</p>
<p>‘Well， it's a bit heavy on top． Do you think your dogs will be able to pull that？’</p>
<p>“哦，顶头太重了。你想你的狗拉这么多东西吃得消吗？”</p>
<p>‘Of course they will，’said Hal． The sledge was now ready to go．‘ Come on，dogs， pull！’ he shouted ．</p>
<p>“他们当然拉得动。”哈尔说。雪撬已经准备起程。“来，狗，拉车。”他喊道。</p>
<p>The dogs pulled as hard as they could， but the sledge did not move．</p>
<p>狗使出全身的力气拉，但雪撬纹丝未动。</p>
<p>‘The lazy animals！’shouted Hal， picking up his whip．</p>
<p>“懒东西！”哈尔叫着，抡起了鞭子。</p>
<p>But Mercedes stopped him ‘Oh， Hal， you mustn't，’ she cried， pulling the whip away from him ．‘The poor dogs．You must promise to be nice to them or I'm staying here！’</p>
<p>然尔玛尔赛蒂制止了他，“哦，哈尔，别这样！”她哭叫道，夺过鞭子。“可怜的狗。你必须发誓从此要善待他们，不然我就呆在这儿不走了。”</p>
<p>‘You know nothing about dogs，’ answered Hal．‘ Leave me alone Dogs are lazy， and you have to whip them． Everybody knows that． Ask those men if you don't believe me．’</p>
<p>“你懂什么，”哈尔回答，“别管我。狗都是犯懒的，你必须鞭打它们。这道理人人皆知，不信你问问那些人。”</p>
<p>Mercedes turned and looked at the watching men．</p>
<p>玛尔赛蒂转身去看围观的人。</p>
<p>‘They’ re tired， if you really want to know，’ said one of them ‘They’ ve been working very hard and they need a rest．’</p>
<p>“他们太累了，如果你真想知道答案的话，”一个人说。“他们干的太苦了，着实需要休息一下。”</p>
<p>‘Rest？’laughed Hal．‘These stupid dogs are just lazy．’</p>
<p>“休息？”哈尔笑道。“这些蠢狗只是犯懒。”</p>
<p>Now Mercedes decided that her brother was right．‘Don't listen to that man，’she said ‘You're driving our dogs and you do what you think is best．’</p>
<p>现在玛尔赛蒂认为她弟弟是对的。“别听那人的，”她说。“你驾驭我们的狗，你觉得怎么好就怎么办。”</p>
<p>Now Hal used his whip on the dogs. They pulled and pulled，but the sledge stayed where it was．Hal was still using his whip when Mercedes stopped him again and put her arms around Buck．</p>
<p>于是哈尔对狗抡起了鞭子。他们拉呀拉呀，但是雪撬仍然原地不动。正当哈尔抽打狗的时候，玛尔赛蒂又制止了他，然后她用手搂住巴克。</p>
<p>‘You poor，poor dears，’she said．‘Why don't you pull hard？—then nobody will whip you．’</p>
<p>“你这可怜的，可怜的宝贝，”她说，“你为什么不使劲拉呢——这样没有人会打你了。”</p>
<p>One of the men watching now spoke again．‘I don't care what happens to you，’ he said，‘but I'm sorry for the dogs．The sledge is frozen to the snow，and you'll have to break it out． Push it from one side to the other to break the ice．’</p>
<p>其中一个观望的人又说话了，“我可不愿管你们，”他说，“但我认为狗太可怜了。雪撬冻到雪地上了，你必须把冰砸开，从一边向另一边推雪撬可以破冰。”</p>
<p>Hal tried again，but this time he broke the ice under the sledge．The heavy sledge started to move slowly，Buck and his team pulling hard under the whip．After a hundred metres they had to turn into another street．It was a difficult turn with a top-heavy load，and Hal was not a good driver．As they turned，the sledge went over onto its side，throwing boxes and packets into the street．The dogs didn't stop． The sledge was not so heavy now and they pulled it easily on its side．The whip had made them angry and they started to run．Hal cried ‘Stop！’ but the dogs continued through Skagway，and the rest of the luggage fell off as they ran．</p>
<p>哈尔又试了一次，但这一次他终于把雪撬下的冰弄破了，沉重的雪撬慢慢地开始移动。巴克和他的队伍艰难地在鞭打下拉着雪撬，100米之后他们不得不拐到另一条街上去。拉着头重脚轻的雪撬是很难转弯的，何况哈尔又不是个赶车的好手。转弯时，雪撬向一边倾斜，把一些包裹和箱子扔到了街上，但狗并未停住脚。雪撬此时不再那么沉重，而他们拉起来容易多了。鞭答激怒了他们，他们开始奔跑。哈尔叫着“停下”，但狗却继续在斯开格威跑着，其余的行李也随着他们的奔跑纷纷掉下来。</p>
<p>People helped to catch the dogs and to pick up all the things from the street． They also told the men that if they wanted to reach Dawson，they needed twice as many dogs and half as much luggage．Hal and Charles went back to the camp and started to look at the luggage and throw things away．Tent，blankets and plates were taken out．Mercedes cried when most of her clothes went．When they had finished，Mercedes was still crying，there was a lot of luggage on the road，and there was still a lot to go on the sledge．</p>
<p>人们帮着拉住狗，捡起街上掉落的行李。他们还告诉这些人如果他们想到达道桑，他们需要多一倍的狗，而行李必须减半。哈尔和查尔斯返回营地，开始检查行李，扔掉多余的东西。帐篷，毯子和碟子被拿了下来。玛尔赛蒂哭喊起来，她大部分衣服也被扔掉了。最后他们结束时，玛尔赛蒂仍然在哭泣。路上仍然有许多行李，而雪撬上的东西仍然太多。</p>
<p>Then Charles and Hal went out and bought six more dogs，so they now had fourteen． But the new dogs were not real sledge－dogs and they knew nothing about the work．Charles and Hal put them into harness， but Buck could not teach them how to pull a sledge．So now there were six dogs who couldn't pull at all， and eight who were tired after pulling for four thousand kilometres．But Charles and Hal were happy．They had more dogs than any sledge that they had seen at Skagway．They didn’ t know that no sledge could carry enough food for fourteen dogs．</p>
<p>然后查尔斯和哈尔跑出去买了6条狗，现在他们有14条狗。但是这些新狗并不是真正的拉雪撬的狗，他们不知道如何工作。查尔斯和哈尔给他们套上挽具，但巴克却无法教他们如何拉雪撬。于是有了6条根本不会拉车的狗，和8条在跋涉了4000公里之后筋疲力尽的狗。但查尔斯和哈尔很高兴，他们的狗比斯开格威任何一座雪撬上的狗都多。他们根本不知道没有一个雪撬可以负载14条狗的食物。</p>
<p>The next morning Buck led the team up the street．They moved slowly， because they were tired before they started．Buck had pulled to Dawson and back twice，and he didn't want to do it again．He had watched Hal and Charles and Mercedes and he saw that they didn't know how to do any thing．And，as the days passed，he saw that they could not learn．It took them half the evening to get everything ready for the night；and it took them half the morning to get ready to leave． And when they did start， they often had to stop because something had fallen off the sledge．On some days they travelled twenty kilometres and on some days only ten．</p>
<p>第二天早上，巴克带领狗队沿街出发了。他们走得很慢，因为在旅途开始前他们就很疲惫了。巴克已经从道桑来回往返了两次，他不想再跑了。他观察了查尔斯、哈尔和玛尔赛蒂，他看出他们对所有的事情都手足无措。而且，随着时间一天天过去，他发现他们学不会任何东西。他们花掉半个夜晚准备晚上的休息；然后又花了半个早晨才准备停当起程。而真正起程后，他们经常不得不停下来，因为有些东西从雪撬上滑落下来，有一阵子他们每天只走20公里，有时只走10公里。</p>
<p>They didn't have enough dog food when they started，and they used what they had much too quickly．Hal gave the dogs extra food because he wanted them to pull harder．Mercedes gave them extra food because she was sorry for them．But it was not food that they wanted，but rest．</p>
<p>他们起程时就没有足够的狗食。现在他们的给养用得太快了。哈尔给狗加餐因为他想让他们更加卖力地拉车。玛尔赛蒂也总是多给狗食物，因为她可怜他们。但是他们需要的不是食物，而是休息。</p>
<p>Soon Hal saw that they had travelled only a quarter of the way to Dawson，but had eaten half their food．He had to give the dogs less food． It was easy to give them less food，but it was impossible to make them travel faster．</p>
<p>很快，哈尔发现他们只走了去道桑的四分之一的路，却吃掉了一半的食物，他不得不减少给狗的食物。少给狗食物容易办到，但是却无法让他们跑快。</p>
<p>Dub had pulled hard and well all the way from Skagway，but he had hurt his leg．It got worse and worse until finally Hal had to shoot him．The six new dogs，now weak and ill from hunger and hard work，died next．</p>
<p>达布在离开斯开格威的一路都拉得很卖力，但是他的腿受了伤。他的腿伤越来越厉害，直到最后哈尔不得不杀了他。那6条新狗，由于饥饿和辛苦而病弱不堪，很快就死掉了。</p>
<p>Hal，Charles，and Mercedes had started the journey happily；but now they were tired，cross and miserable．Charles and Hal argued about everything，because each thought that he was working harder than the other．And Mer cedes was unhappy because she thought that she shouldn't have to work．She was tired，so she rode on the sledge，mak ing the work even harder for the dogs．She rode for days，until the dogs could not move the sledge．The men asked her to walk，but she would not leave the sledge．One day they lifted her off．She sat in the snow and did not move．They went off with the sledge and travelled five kilometres．Then they turned，went back，and lifted her on again．</p>
<p>哈尔、查尔斯和玛尔赛蒂开始旅行时高高兴兴，但现在他们疲惫，暴躁又沮丧。查尔斯和哈尔为每件事争吵不休，每个人都自觉比别人干的活儿更多。玛尔赛蒂也不高兴，因为她觉得她不应该工作。她很累，所以就坐到雪撬上，这使狗的工作更加艰难。她一直坐着直到狗拉不动雪撬了。男人们请求她走路。但她不肯离开雪撬，一天他们把她抬了下来，她坐到雪地上不肯起来，他们扔下她走了5公里，然后又返回来捎上了她。</p>
<p>Buck and the other dogs were now just skin and bone．They pulled when they could，and when they couldn't they lay down in the snow．When they were whipped，they stood up and tried to pull again．</p>
<p>巴克和其余的狗都已瘦得皮包骨头了。他们能拉车时就拉，拉不动时就倒在雪地上，当鞭子抽打下来时，就再站起来吃力地拉雪撬。</p>
<p>One day Billee fell and could not stand up．Hal killed him and threw him into the snow． Buck and the other dogs knew that soon they were going to die，too．On the next day Koona died，and there were only five dogs left：Joe，Pike，Sol－leks the one－eyed，Teek，and Buck．</p>
<p>一天，贝利倒下去再也没有站起来。哈尔杀了他然后把他抛在了雪地上。巴克和别的狗都意识到他们很快也要死去。第二天，科娜也死了，现在只剩下五条狗：乔，派克，独眼索拉克斯，蒂克还有巴克。</p>
<p>It was beautiful spring weather．The snow and ice were melting，the plants were growing，and the forest animals were waking from their winter sleep．It was a lovely morning when the two men， and the five dogs pulling Mercedes on the sledge，came into John Thornton's camp at White River．They stopped，and the dogs dropped down immediately to rest．</p>
<p>美丽的春天终于来了，冰雪消融，万物复苏。在一个可爱的早晨，两个人，和5条狗拉着雪撬上的玛尔赛蒂，抵达了白河河畔，约翰&middot;桑顿的营地。他们刚停下来，狗立刻瘫倒在地休息。</p>
<p>John Thornton was mending an axe，and he went on working as he talked to Hal．</p>
<p>约翰&middot;桑顿正在做一把斧子，他一边同哈尔聊天一边干活儿。</p>
<p>‘Is it safe to cross the river here？’asked Hal．</p>
<p>“现在过河安全吗？”哈尔问道。</p>
<p>‘No，the ice is too thin．It's much too dangerous，answered Thornton．</p>
<p>“不行，冰太薄了，非常危险。”桑顿回答。</p>
<p>‘People have told us that before，’laughed Hal，‘but we got here with no problems．’</p>
<p>“人们老早就告诉过我们这个。”哈尔笑道，“但是我们平安到了这里。”</p>
<p>‘Only somebody very stupid would cross the White River here，’said Thornton．</p>
<p>“只有愚蠢的人才会从这儿过白河。”桑顿说。</p>
<p>‘That's what you think，’said Hal．‘But we've got to get to Dawson．’He pickd up his whip．‘Come on，Buck！Get up now！Let's go！’</p>
<p>“也就你这么想吧，”哈尔说，“但我们无论如何是要到道桑去的。”他拾起鞭子。“来，巴克！现在起来！我们走！”</p>
<p>Thornton went on working．He had warned them，but he knew he couldn't stop these stupid men from going on．</p>
<p>桑顿继续他的工作。他已经警告过他们，但是他知道他无法阻止这些愚蠢的人。</p>
<p>But Buck didn't get up．Sol-leks stood up slowly，then Teek and Joe，and finally Pike．But Buck stayed where he was．The whip came down on him again and again．Thornton started to speak，then stopped，and began to walk up and down．</p>
<p>但是巴克却没有起来，索拉克斯慢腾腾地爬起来，然后是蒂克和乔，最后是派克。只有巴克没挪身子，鞭子一次又一次抽到他的身上。桑顿想说什么，又忍住了，然后他开始走来走去。</p>
<p>Hal now put down his whip and started to hit Buck with a club．But Buck had decided not to get up．He had felt thin ice under his feet all day and he saw thin ice in front of him．The club hit him again and again，but Buck felt almost nothing．</p>
<p>哈尔放下鞭子开始用木棍打巴克。但是巴克铁了心不再站起来。整整一天他的脚下都是稀薄的冰，现在他看到那不堪重负的冰层就在面前。木棍劈头盖脸砸下来，而巴克却全无知觉。</p>
<p>Then suddenly， with a wild cry，John Thornton jumped on Hal，throwing him backwards．Mercedes screamed．</p>
<p>突然，伴着一声狂吼，约翰&middot;桑顿扑向哈尔，把他向后撞去。玛尔赛蒂尖叫起来。</p>
<p>‘If you hit that dog again，I’11 kill you，’Thornton shouted．</p>
<p>“如果你再动那狗一下，我就宰了你，”桑顿怒喊着。</p>
<p>‘He's my dog，’Hal replied．There was blood on his face．‘Get out of my way，or I’11 hit you，too．I'm going to Dawson．’</p>
<p>“他是我的狗。”哈尔回答说，他的脸上沾着鲜血。“别碍我的事儿，否则我连你一块揍，我要去道桑。”</p>
<p>Thornton stood between Hal and Buck and did not move．Hal took out his long knife，but Thornton knocked it out of his hand．Mercedes screamed again．Then Thornton picked up Hal's knife and cut Buck out of the harness．</p>
<p>桑顿站在哈尔和巴克中间一动未动。哈尔抽出了他的长刀，但是桑顿把它打落了。玛尔赛蒂又尖叫起来，然后桑顿拾起哈尔的长刀，劈开巴克身上的挽具。</p>
<p>Hal didn't want to fight，and Buck was not worth fighting for；he was nearly dead． Hal started the sledge and went down towards the river．Buck lifted his head and watched the sledge move away．Pike was leading，and Joe，Teek and Sol－leks were behind him．Hal was walking in front of the sledge and Mercedes was riding on it；Charles was walking behind．</p>
<p>哈尔并不想打架，何况为巴克也不值得去打架，他已经奄奄一息了。哈尔驾着雪撬向河驶去。巴克抬起头望着移动的雪撬。派克打头，乔，蒂克和索拉克斯跟在他后面。哈尔走在雪撬前面，玛尔赛蒂坐在雪撬上，查尔斯随后。</p>
<p>As Buck watched，Thornton felt his body with gentle hands，searching for broken bones．Buck was very thin，very tired and very weak，but Thornton didn't think he was going to die．Then both dog and man watched the sledge as it went slowly out on to the ice in the middle of the river．Suddenly the back of the sledge went down and the front went up into the air． Mercedes screamed，and Charles turned and took one step back． Then a big piece of ice broke off，and dogs，sledge and people disappeared；there was only a big hole in the ice．</p>
<p>巴克一边看着他们，桑顿一边用手轻轻抚摸着他的身体，寻找着破碎的骨头。巴克虽然瘦骨嶙峋，衰疲不已，但桑顿却仍然觉得他有救。人和狗一起注视着雪撬缓缓地行到河中央。突然雪撬的后部陷了下去，前部向空中翘起。玛尔赛蒂尖叫起来，查尔斯转身刚后退了一步，随后一大块冰破裂了，雪撬、狗还有人一起没了踪影，冰面上只留下了一个大洞。</p>
<p>John Thornton and Buck looked at one another．</p>
<p>约翰&middot;桑顿和巴克互相对视着。</p>
<p>‘You poor thing，’said John Thornton，and Buck licked his hand．</p>
<p>“你这可怜儿，”约翰&middot;桑顿说，巴克舔着他的手。</p><a href='6.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
