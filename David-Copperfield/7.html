<p><b>7 大卫的好消息和坏消息 </b></p>
<p>All this time I had gone on loving Dora more than ever．</p>
<p>在这段日子里，我对朵拉的爱越来越强烈。</p>
<p>The more evil there seemed to be in the world，the more brightly Dora's star shone down on me．I am sure I considered her a beautiful angel，far above the rest of us poor humans，and I had no real hope of persuading her to love me．</p>
<p>似乎这世上有越多的罪恶、黑暗，朵拉这颗星就会照得我心里越亮。我确信自己已经把她看作是美丽的天使，远远地高于我们这些可怜的凡人之上。我并不真想说服她来爱我。</p>
<p>Peggotty had come to London with me，as she was feeling rather lonely after Barkis's death and Daniel's departure，and I could not stop myself telling her all about Dora．She was very interested，and most encouraging．</p>
<p>辟果提和我一起来到伦敦，因为巴克斯的死和丹尼尔的离开使她感到非常孤独。我控制不住把有关朵拉的事全告诉了她。她很感兴趣，并且一个劲地鼓励我。</p>
<p>‘The young lady should be very proud to have such a hand－some，intelligent young man as you，Master Davie！’she cried．‘And I'm sure her father will be delighted to accept you as her husband！’But I could not share her hopeful view of the sitution．</p>
<p>“有你这样英竣聪明的年轻人追求她，这位年轻小姐应该感到十分自豪，大卫少爷！”她叫道，“而且我相信她父亲也会很高兴接受你这位女婿！”然而，我不敢赞同她对我的处境所持的乐观态度。</p>
<p>However，a wonderful thing happened．During a long conversation with Mr Spenlow in the office，he mentioned that it was Dora's birthday the following week，and invited me to a picnic to celebrate it．As soon as I heard this，I went completely mad，and could not think at all clearly．In the next week I bought expensive new clothes and boots，and arranged to hire a handsome white horse．On the day of the picnic， I got up at six in the morning and went to Govent Garden market to buy the freshest and most beautiful flowers for Dora，and by ten o’clock I was riding towards the Spenlows’house．</p>
<p>不过，绝好的机会出现了。在办公室与斯本罗先生的一次长谈中，他透露下周是朵拉的生日，并邀请我一起去野餐以示庆祝。听到这消息，我完全喜疯了，根本不能冷静地考虑什么。到了第二周，我买了一身昂贵的衣服和一双靴子，订租了一匹漂亮的白马。野餐那天，我6点钟起床，到科文特花市给朵拉买了最新鲜最漂亮的一束花。10点钟，我骑着马来到了斯本罗先生家。</p>
<p>How lovely Dora looked，in her sky－blue dress and white hat，when I met her in the garden in front of the house！And when she accepted my flowers with delight，I almost thought I would die of happiness．</p>
<p>在门前的花园里我遇见了朵拉，多么可爱的朵拉，穿一身天蓝色的衣服，戴一顶白色的帽子！当她高兴地接过我的鲜花时，我感觉自己都快要幸福死了！</p>
<p>‘You'll be glad to hear，Mr Copperfield，’she said，smiling prettily，‘that cross Miss Murdstone isn't here．She'll be away for at least three weeks．Instead I have my dear friend，Miss Julia Mills，here with me．’</p>
<p>“跟你说了你准高兴，科波菲尔先生，”她妩媚地一笑，说道，“那位严厉的摩德斯通小姐不在。她至少三个星期不会回来。我嘛，有我的好朋友朱莉亚&middot;米尔斯和我作伴。”</p>
<p>Sitting next to Dora was a young lady I had not noticed be－fore．Although she was only about twenty，she looked very calm and wise．I later discovered that she had had an unhappy experience in love，and had decided never again to become personally involved in matters of the heart．</p>
<p>坐在朵拉身边的是一位我刚才没注意到的年轻小姐。尽管她大约只有20岁，可她显得很沉稳，很机智。我后来知道，她有过一段不愉快的恋爱史，所以决定再也不卷入个人情感的漩涡中。</p>
<p>‘How delightful for you！’I answered，blushing as I always did when I spoke to Dora．‘And everything that is delightful to you is delightful to me，Miss Spenlow！’Miss Mills said nothing，but smiled kindly on us both．</p>
<p>“真替你高兴！”我红着脸回答，我一跟朵拉说话就脸红。“所有你高兴的事，我也高兴，斯本罗小姐！”米尔斯小姐没说什么，只是善意地冲我俩笑笑。</p>
<p>To get to the picnic place，which was some way from the house，Mr Spenlow，Dora and Miss Mills drove in an open carriage，while I rode by their side on my handsome white horse．I shall never have such a ride again．Dora sat with her back to the horses，looking towards me，and holding my flowers close to her sweet face．Our eyes often met，and I am surprised I did not fall off my horse．I did not notice the dust，or the road we were taking，Sometimes Mr Spenlow spoke to me about the scenery，and I replied politely，but I cannot remember what I said．All I could see was Dora．</p>
<p>野餐地点距离住所有一段距离，斯本罗先生、朵拉和米尔斯小姐坐在敞篷的马车上，我骑着我那漂亮的白马伴在他们旁边。我再也感觉不到那种骑马的感觉了。朵拉背对着马匹坐着，看着我，把我送给她的花贴到她甜美的脸上，我们的目光常常相遇，我奇怪自己居然没从马上摔下来。我注意不到飞扬的尘土，记不得我们走过的路线。有时，斯本罗先生跟我说几句赞美风景的话，我出于礼貌回答了，可我不记得自己说了什么，我所看见的只有朵拉。</p>
<p>I was very disappointed when we arrived，to find that other guests had been invited．I wat quite jealous even of the ladies，because they talked to Dora and took her away from me，but I hated all the men as soon as I saw them．There was a very unpleasant，talkative man with a red moustache，who insisted he knew all about preparing food，and soon had most of the young ladies round him．One of them was Dora．I felt that he was now my worst enemy．</p>
<p>到达目的地时，我很失望地发现，被邀请的还有其他客人。我甚至连小姐太太都嫉妒，因为她们总拉着朵拉说话，把她从我身边带走。我更恨那些男士们，从第一眼见到他们起。其中有一位很烦人、喋喋不休、留着红色小胡子的家伙，自称精通做饭之道，很快把绝大多数女士吸引到他身边，其中也包括朵拉。我觉得他是我当时最危险的敌人。</p>
<p>When we started eating，I saw to my horror that Red Moustache was sitting，with a huge plate of chicken，at Dora's feet！I could not think clearly，but I pretended to be cheerful．I sat with a young lady dressed in pink，and talked amusingly to her，and looked at her，and fetched her whatever she needed．Sometimes I looked over at Dora，and she looked back at me，but she had Red Moustache and I had the young lady in pink．</p>
<p>我们开始用餐时，我惊恐地发现“红胡子”端着一大碗鸡肉坐在朵拉的脚边！我的脑子不能清醒地思考了，可我仍装出一副高兴的样子。我坐到一位穿粉红衣服的年轻小姐身边，饶有兴致地跟她交谈，看着她，并帮她取她所需要的任何东西。时不时地，我抬头看朵拉几眼，她也回看我几眼，可她有“红胡子”，我有粉衣姑娘。</p>
<p>After the meal，the young lady's mother took her away，and I walked alone into a wood，feeling angry and desperate．I was just planning to ride away on my handsome white horse，although I did not know where to，when I saw Dora and Miss Mills coming to meet me．</p>
<p>饭后，这位年轻小姐的母亲把她带走了，我独自走进树林，心中既气愤又绝望。我准备骑上我那漂亮的小白马走开，尽管我不知道自己要去哪里，这时，我看见朵拉和米尔斯小姐向我走来。</p>
<p>‘Mr Copperfield，’said Miss Mills，‘You are unhappy．’</p>
<p>“科波菲尔先生，”米尔斯小姐说，“你不高兴。”</p>
<p>‘No，no，Miss Mills！’I protested firmly．‘Perfectly happy！’</p>
<p>“不，不，米尔斯小姐！”我坚定地否认，“我非常高兴！”</p>
<p>‘And Dora，’continued Miss Mills，‘you are unhappy．’</p>
<p>“还有你，朵拉，”米尔斯小姐继续道，“你不高兴。”</p>
<p>‘Oh good heavens，no，Julia！’cried Dora．‘Not at all！’</p>
<p>“哦，上帝！不，朱莉亚，我很高兴！”朵拉叫道。</p>
<p>‘Mr Copperfield and Dora，’said Miss Mills，looking old and wise，‘enough of this foolishness！You love each other！Confess it and be happy！Take the chance that life offers you！Listen to one who speaks from bitter experience！’</p>
<p>“科波菲尔先生，朵拉，”米尔斯小姐说道，看上去既老练又聪明，“愚蠢的把戏玩够了！你们俩各自都爱着对方！承认吧，高兴起来！抓住生活给你们创造的机会！相信一位有过痛苦经历的人的话吧！”</p>
<p>I was so hot and excited that I took Dora's little hand immediately and kissed it—and she let me！I kissed Miss Mills's hand too，and life seemed wonderful again．</p>
<p>我热血沸腾，激动万分，猛地抓起朵拉的手吻了一下——她没有抗拒！我也吻了米尔斯小姐的手，生活似乎又重放光彩了。</p>
<p>Dora shyly put her arm in mine and we walked about together，until，much too soon，we heard the other guests calling her name．So we had to go back，and when they wanted Dora to sing a song，Red Moustache offered to fetch the guitar from the carriage for her．But Dora told him nobody except me knew where it was．</p>
<p>朵拉很腼腆地把自己的手搭在我的臂弯里，我们一起朝前走，可是没过多会儿我们听到有客人叫她的名字，我们只好往回走。他们要求朵拉唱一首歌，“红胡子”自告奋勇提出为她去取吉他，但朵拉告诉他，除了我，谁也不知道吉他在哪儿。</p>
<p>So I fetched the guitar，and I held her gloves，and I sat beside her while she sang．And I knew that in that great crowd of people she was singing only for me，who loved her．</p>
<p>这样，我取来了吉他。她唱歌时我坐在她旁边，给她拿着手套。我知道，在这一群人中间，她只为我一个人，一个爱她的人歌唱。</p>
<p>When the guests left，I rode beside the carriage all the way back to the Spenlows’house．Mr Spenlow，who had drunk a lot of wine，was asleep in his seat，and Miss Mills was smiling in a motherly way，as Dora and I whispered happily to each other．Once Miss Mills called me to her side of the carriage．</p>
<p>客人们离开后，我骑着马一路护送马车回到斯本罗住宅。斯本罗先生喝了很多酒，在座位上睡着了。米尔斯小姐露出母亲般慈爱的微笑，看着朵拉和我幸福地窃窃私语。其中有一次，米尔斯小姐把我叫到她那一侧的马车前。</p>
<p>‘Dora is coming to stay with me，’she told me quietly，‘ the day after tomorrow．Perhaps you would like to visit us？’</p>
<p>“朵拉要去我那儿，”她平静地告诉我，“后天。你或许愿意去看看我们？”</p>
<p>‘Miss Mills！How can I ever thank you？’I said．‘What a friend you are—to Miss Spenlow and me！’</p>
<p>“米尔斯小姐！我怎么才能感谢你呢？”我说，“你是多好的朋友——斯本罗小姐和我的朋友！”</p>
<p>When we arrived at the Spenlows ’house，I had to say goodbye to Dora and ride back to London．On the way，I remembered everything she had done or said ten thousand times．I decided I had to tell her I loved her as soon as possible，and ask whether she loved me too．It was the most important question in the world，and only Dora could give me the answer to it．</p>
<p>我们到达斯本罗住所后我不得不和朵拉道别，骑马回伦敦。一路上，我成千上万次地回忆起朵拉和我说的和做的每一件事情，我决定尽快告诉她我爱她，并问她是否也爱我。这是世界上最重要的问题，而且只要朵拉才能给我问题的答案。</p>
<p>So，two days later，I dressed in my finest clothes and went to the address Miss Mills had given me．The servant took me to the sittingroom，where I found Julia Mills learning a song，and Dora painting the flowers I had given her！After a short conversation Miss Mills made an excuse and left the room，and Dora and I were alone together．</p>
<p>于是，两天后我穿上最好的衣服，按米尔斯小姐给我的地址来到她家。用人把我领进客厅，我看见米尔斯小姐正在学唱一支歌，朵拉正在画我送给她的花！短短地聊了几句后，米尔斯小姐找了个借口离开了，朵拉和我就单独留在客厅。</p>
<p>‘I hope your poor horse wasn't tired the other night，’said Dora，raising her beautiful eyes to mine．‘It was a long way for him，to and from the picnic place．’</p>
<p>“我希望前天夜里你的马不致于太累吧，”朵拉抬起她美丽的大眼睛看着我，说，“从野餐地点来回地跑，对它来说是段很长的路。”</p>
<p>I must ask her today！I thought．My whole body was trembling．‘It was a long way for him，’I answered．‘For me it seemed very short，because of my happiness in being so near you．’</p>
<p>我一定要今天问她！我心里想着，浑身上下都在颤抖。“对它来说是一段很长的路，”我回答，“可对我却似乎很短，因为有你离我这么近，带给我快乐。”</p>
<p>There was a moment's silence．Then Dora said，‘You didn't seem to care for that happiness earlier in the day，when you were sitting with the lady in pink．But I expect you don't mean what you say．And of course you're quite free to do whatever you like！’</p>
<p>沉默了一阵后，朵拉说道：“在那天的早些时候，你好像并不在乎这种快乐，当你坐在那位穿粉红色衣服的女孩身边。不过，我希望你只是说说而已。当然，你有权爱怎么做就怎么做！”</p>
<p>I don't know how I did it．It happened so quickly．Suddenly I had Dora in my arms and I couldn't stop speaking．I told her how I loved her．I told her I would die without her．And when she blushed and cried a little，I said I had loved her day and night since the moment I had first seen her．I told her that nobody had ever loved or could ever love as much as I loved her．</p>
<p>我不知道我是怎么做的。一切发生得如此迅速。我突然抱住朵拉，滔滔不绝地说个没完。我告诉她我有多爱她，我告诉她没有她我就会死掉。当她红着脸，轻声地哭泣时，我说，从看见她的一瞬间起，我日日夜夜都在爱她，我告诉她，没有人曾像我这么爱她，并永远像我这样爱她。</p>
<p>Somehow I found myself sitting quietly next to Dora on the sofa，holding her little hand．We were engaged！I suppose we realized that one day we would get married，but for the moment we were going to keep our engagement secret from Mr Spenlow．When Miss Mills came in，she was delighted to hear our news，and promised to help us as much as possible．</p>
<p>不知不觉地，我发现自己安静地坐在朵拉身边，握着她的小手。我们订下了终身！我想我们明白将来有一天我们会结婚，但目前我们打算先对斯本罗先生保守我们已经订婚的秘密。米尔斯小姐进来了，她很高兴听到这个消息，并答应尽最大努力帮助我们。</p>
<p>Now began one of the happiest times of my life．When I look back，I see how foolish I was，but how loving and sincere！I visited Dora every day，and I did not have time for anyone or anything else．But in the middle of my excitement I suddenly thought of Agnes，of her clear calm eyes and her gentle face，and I sat down immediately to write to her，and tell her all about Dora．I knew that as my adopted sister she would share my happiness，and I wanted her approval．</p>
<p>这样，我一生中最幸福的时光开始了。我现在回想起来，觉得自己好傻，可又是那么可爱，那么真诚！我每天去看朵拉，没有时间顾及别人，干别的事情。然而，在我兴奋之中我突然想到了阿格尼斯，想到她沉稳的目光和温柔的神情，我立刻坐下来给她写信，告诉她有关朵拉的一切。我知道，作为我的义姐，她会分享我的快乐，而且我需要她的支持。</p>
<p>One day when Peggotty and I were having tea in my flat，Tommy Traddles came to visit me．‘My dear Copperfield！’he cried．‘I've been several times before，but you've been out．’</p>
<p>一天，我正和辟果提在我寓所喝茶，汤米&middot;特拉德尔来找我。“亲爱的科波菲尔！”他叫道，“我来过好几次，你都没在家。”</p>
<p>‘My dear Traddles，’I replied，‘yes，I'm very sorry， I've been visiting my—Miss，D，you know．’</p>
<p>“亲爱的特拉德尔，”我回答，“是的，我很抱歉，我总去找我的——D小姐，你知道。”</p>
<p>‘I expect she lives in London，doesn't she？Mine—that's Sopby—beautiful name，isn't it？Mine lives in Devon，I think I told you．So I don't see her very often．She really is the dearest girl！She's very busy at home，you know，looking after the other nine children．And her mother，who's unable to walk．’</p>
<p>“我想她住在伦敦，是吧？我的——索菲——很美的名字，是吧？我的那位住在德文，我想我跟你说过。所以我不常见她。她的的确确是最可亲的姑娘！她在家非常忙，你知道，要照看其他9个孩子，还有她的母亲，不能行动的母亲。”</p>
<p>‘What a wonderful girl she must be！’I agreed politely．‘And tell me，Traddles，how is Mr Micawber？’</p>
<p>“她真是位了不起的姑娘！”我礼貌地附和道，“告诉我，特拉德尔，米考伯先生怎么样了？”</p>
<p>‘I'm not living in his house at the moment，’said Traddles，‘because his creditors demanded payment of his debts recently，and he had to move to another house．To avoid these unpleasant men，he's even changed his name to Mortimer，and he only comes out of the house after dark，wearing glasses．’</p>
<p>“我现阶段没住他们家，”特拉德尔说，“因为他的债主们最近总是催债，他只好搬到别处去祝为了避免这些讨厌的人，他甚至把自己的名字改作摩尔提么，他只在天黑后出门，并带上眼镜。”</p>
<p>‘So nothing has turned up for him yet？And what abut the money you lent him，Traddles？’</p>
<p>“看来他还是没遇到转机？你借给他的钱怎么样了，特拉德尔？”</p>
<p>‘I'm afraid I may not get it back．But Mr Micawber promises to give it back one day．He's a fine，honest man，isn't he？’And Traddles looked hopefully at me．</p>
<p>“恐怕是要不回来了，可米考伯先生答应我总有一天会还给我。他是一个好人、一个很善良的人，是吧？”特拉德尔乐观地看我一眼。</p>
<p>Before I could reply，we heard footsteps on the stairs．I was very surprised to see my aunt coming upstairs．She was carrying two cases and her cat，and was followed closely by Mr Dick，carrying two more cases．</p>
<p>我正要回答，只听得楼梯口一阵脚步声。我很吃惊看见姨婆正往上走。她提着两个箱子，抱着她的宠猫，身后紧跟着迪克先生，提着另外两个箱子。</p>
<p>‘My dear aunt！’I cried．‘What an unexpected pleasure！’We kissed each other，and I shook hands with Mr Dick．Traddles left quietly，as he could see we would be discussing family matters．Peggotty made some more tea for my aunt，who had sat down heavily on her cases．</p>
<p>“亲爱的姨婆！”我叫道，“多么意外的惊喜！”我们互相亲吻了一下，我和迪克先生握了握手。特拉德尔悄悄地离开了，因为他知道我们接下来就要商讨家事。辟果提给姨婆另沏了一些茶，可她却重重地坐在了她的箱子上。</p>
<p>‘Dear aunt！’I said．‘Make yourself more comfortable！Sit in an armchair，or sit on the sofa！’</p>
<p>“亲爱的姨婆！”我说，“您可以让自己舒服点！坐到椅子上或是沙发上吧！”</p>
<p>‘Why do you think I'm sitting on my cases？she asked，looking seriously at me．</p>
<p>“你知道我为什么坐在箱子上吗？”她问，很认真地看着我。</p>
<p>I shook my head，unable to guess．</p>
<p>我摇了摇头，猜不出来。</p>
<p>‘Because what I'm sitting on is all I have！Because I've lost all my money，my dear！’</p>
<p>“因为我坐着的就是我的全部所有！我失去了全部的积蓄，我亲爱的！”</p>
<p>I couldn't have been more shocked if the house and all of us in it had fallen into the River Thames．</p>
<p>没有比这让我更震惊的消息了，那怕是这房子和这房子里的人都掉进了泰晤士河。</p>
<p>‘Yes，’continued my aunt，putting her head calmly on my shoulder．‘I'll tell you all about it tomorrow，David，but tonight we must find a bed for Mr Dick，and I'll sleep here，to save money．’So that night，my aunt agreed to take my bed，while I planned to sleep on the sitting-room sofa，and I took Mr Dick to a neighbour's house to rent a room．When I returned，I found my aunt walking up and down in front of the sitting-room fire．</p>
<p>“是的，”姨婆接着说道，把头静静地枕在我的肩上，“明天我会告诉你一切，大卫，但今晚我们必须给迪克先生找个地方睡觉，我可以睡在这里，省点钱。”就这样，那天晚上，姨婆同意了睡我的床，我自己则准备睡客厅的沙发，我给迪克先生租了一间附近邻居的房间。我回来时，发现姨婆在客厅里踱来踱去。</p>
<p>‘That Peggotty woman is very fond of you，David！’ she said．‘ She's been offering to give us some of her money—the money she inherited from her husband！Of course I refused at once．But she's a good woman．</p>
<p>“那位叫辟果提的女人对你很好，大卫！”她说，“她提出要拿出她从她丈夫那儿继承到的一部分钱给我们！我自然一口回绝了，可她是个好人。</p>
<p>And she's been telling me about the trouble at Yarmouth—’</p>
<p>她把雅茅斯的悲剧告诉了我。”</p>
<p>‘Yes，poor Emily！’I could not stop myself saying．</p>
<p>“是的，可怜的埃米莉！”我情不自禁地叫道。</p>
<p>‘Silly Emily，you mean！But I'm sorry for you，because you cared for her once．And now Peggotty tells me you're in love again！’</p>
<p>“你是说愚蠢的埃米莉吧！可我为你感到惋惜，因为你曾经一度关心过她。辟果提告诉我你如今又爱上了一个人！”</p>
<p>I blushed．‘I love Dora with all my heart，aunt！’</p>
<p>我脸红了。“我是真心爱着朵拉，姨婆！”</p>
<p>‘I suppose the little thing is very lovely，is she？’</p>
<p>“我猜那小东西一定很可爱，是吗？”</p>
<p>‘No one can imagine how lovely she is！’</p>
<p>“没有人能想像得出她有多可爱！”</p>
<p>‘She isn't at all silly，is she？’asked my aunt．</p>
<p>“她一点儿都不愚蠢吧，是吗？”姨婆问。</p>
<p>I had never considered this possibility before，and could only repeat what my aunt had said．‘Silly， aunt？’</p>
<p>我以前从未考虑过这种可能性，所以只重复着姨婆的问话，“愚蠢吗，姨婆？”</p>
<p>‘Well，well，I only ask，’replied my aunt gently．‘David，you're very loving，like your poor mother，and you need a good，serious，sensible person to love．’</p>
<p>“好了，好了，我只是随口问问，”姨婆温和地回答，“大卫，你很多情，像你的母亲一样，你需要有个善良、认真、懂事理的人来爱你。”</p>
<p>‘Aunt，if you only knew how sensible Dora is！’I replied．</p>
<p>“姨婆，你要知道朵拉有多懂事理就好了！”我回答。</p>
<p>‘Oh David！’she answered．‘Blind，blind，blind！’</p>
<p>“噢，大卫！”她回答，“盲目，盲目，盲目呀！”</p>
<p>This made me feel a little uncomfortable，but I was glad she knew my secret．I thought perhaps she was rather tiredt，so I said goodnight．She went to my bedroom，and I lay down on the sofa．</p>
<p>她的话使我很不舒服，可我很高兴她知道了我的秘密。我想或许她太累了，就跟她道了晚安。她进了我的卧室，我躺在沙发上。</p>
<p>How miserable I was that night！I knew I should be thinking of my poor aunt's situation，but I could not prevent myself from thinking of Dora．How could I marry her if I had no money，no expensive clothes to wear，no handsome white horse to ride or flowers to give her？</p>
<p>那是多么痛苦的一宿！我知道我该考虑考虑可怜的姨婆的处境，但我控制不住要想朵拉。我要是没钱，没有贵重的衣服，没有漂亮的白马，或者没有鲜花送给她，我怎么能跟她结婚？</p>
<p>The next morning I got up early to have a walk in the fresh air，and on the way home，a carriage stopped beside me，and Agnes Wickfield got out．I immediately felt better when I saw her beautiful calm face smiling at me．She had heard that my aunt was in trouble，and had come to London to see her．We walked together to my flat．</p>
<p>第二天早上，我起得很早，边散步边呼吸着新鲜空气。往回走时，一辆马车在我身边停下来，阿格尼斯&middot;威克菲尔走下车。我看到她那美丽、沉稳的脸正冲我微笑，我顿时觉得心情好多了。她听说我姨婆遇上了麻烦，特到伦敦来看望她。我们一起朝我的寓所走去。</p>
<p>‘You know that Uriah Heep is my father's partner now？'she said quietly．‘His influence over my father is far too great．Father is much，much worse．He looks years older，and I'm afraid that，encouraged by Uriah，he drinks more than ever．Uriah and his old mother live with us now，so I can't always be with Father—to—to protect him from whatever Uriah is planning．I just hope that love and truth will always be stronger than evil！’</p>
<p>“你知道吗，尤赖亚&middot;希普如今已是我父亲的生意合伙人了？”她平静地说道，“他对我父亲的影响太大，父亲身体更加糟糕了。他看上去苍老了好几岁，而且恐怕他受尤赖亚的挑唆喝酒比以前更凶了。尤赖亚和他的老母亲如今和我们住在一起，所以我不能总跟父亲在一起——来——来保护他不受尤赖亚的牵制。我仅仅希望亲情和真诚会战胜罪恶！”</p>
<p>I could not give her my opinion of Uriah，because by then we had arrived at the flat．My aunt was very pleased to see Agnes again，and made us sit down on the sofa next to Peggotty．</p>
<p>我没能谈谈我对尤赖亚的看法，因为那时我们已经走到了我的寓所。姨婆很高兴又一次见到阿格尼斯，并把我们让到辟果提旁边的沙发上坐下。</p>
<p>‘Now let me explain to you all what happened to my money，’said my aunt firmly．I was surprised to see that Agnes was pale and trembling．Betsey Trotwood continued，‘I saved a lot of money over the years，and my lawyer，Mr Wickfield，used to help me invest it in the right companies．But recently I thought he wasn't such a good lawyer as he used to be，so I decided to invest my money myself．What a lot of mistakes I made！Who knows where it's gone？In gold，and foreign banks，and so on．It's no good worrying about it，but I can tell you，there's nothing left．’</p>
<p>“现在我来跟你解释我的钱到底出什么事了，”姨婆坚定地说。奇怪的是，我看见此时的阿格尼斯脸色苍白，浑身发抖。贝茜&middot;特拉伍德继续说，“这些年来我存了一大笔钱，我的律师威克菲尔先生曾帮助我把钱投资到合适的企业。但最近我觉得他已不是原来的那么好的律师了，所以我只好自己决定投资方向。我犯了个多大的错误！谁知道那些钱都去了哪里？换成了黄金，入了外国银行，亦或是别的。为此犯愁没有用，但我可以告诉你，现已一分不剩了。”</p>
<p>The colour was beginning to return to Agnes's face．‘So it—it wasn't my father's fault，dear Miss Trotwood？’</p>
<p>阿格尼斯的脸上重新恢复了血色，“那么说这——这不是我父亲的错，亲爱的特拉伍德小姐？”</p>
<p>‘Not at all，Agnes，’said my aunt cheerfully．‘Now can any of you give me some advice？I've asked my servant Janet to rent my little house in Kent．That will bring in about seventy pounds a year．I think we'll need more than that，to live on．’</p>
<p>“根本不是，阿格尼斯，”姨婆情绪高昂地说道，“现在谁能给我出点主意吗？我已经让我的女仆詹妮特租掉了我在肯特的小别墅。那会给我们带来每年70英镑左右的收入，我想我们靠这些生活是远远不够的。”</p>
<p>‘You and David could share this flat very cheaply，with Mr Dick just round the corner in his rented room，’suggested Agnes．‘And I think I can find a little job for David．Do you remember Dr Strong，the headmaster of the Canterbury school？Now that he's retired and come to live in London，he needs a private secretary to work for him in the mornings and evenings，at his house．He was asking Father about it the other day．What do you think？’</p>
<p>“您和大卫住这套房子，迪克先生就住拐脚处租来的那间房间，开销很小嘛，”阿格尼斯建议道。“而且我想我能给大卫找一份差事。你还记得斯特朗博士吗，坎特伯雷城那所学校的校长？他现已退休，住在伦敦，他需要一位私人秘书，早晚到他家为他工作。他那天向父亲打听此事。你觉得如何？”</p>
<p>‘Agnes！I cried．‘What would we do without you？ You are my good angel，I told you so before！I could easily be Dr Strong's secretary，as well as continuing my work in Mr Spenlow's firm．I'll go and see him today，and arrange it with him．’</p>
<p>“阿格尼斯！”我叫起来，“没有你我们能做什么呢？你是我的好天使，我以前就已经告诉过你！我可以毫不费力地做斯特朗博士的秘书，同时可以继续在斯本罗先生的事务所工作。我今天就去见他，把此事跟他谈妥。”</p>
<p>Agnes gave me her beautiful smile as she got up to leave．I went downstairs with her，and as we walked together to the coach station，I saw an old beggar with a white stick in the street．He was holding out his thin hand for money，and crying，‘Blind！Blind！Blind！’It sounded like an echo of what my aunt had said the day before．Oh Agnes，dear sister！If I had only known then what I discovered long afterwards！</p>
<p>阿格尼斯起身告辞时冲我甜美地一笑。我送她下楼，并一同走到长途马车站，在街上我看见一位年老的乞丐，手拿一根白手杖。他伸着干瘦的手要钱，嘴里叫着，“盲目！盲目！盲目呀！”听起来与我姨婆那天说的那几句相响应。啊，阿格尼斯，亲爱的姐姐！要是我当时就知道这个我很久以后才明白的道理就好了！</p><a href='8.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
