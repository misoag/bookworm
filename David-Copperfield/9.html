<p><b>9 大卫结婚了 </b></p>
<p>When I returned to London， I was delighted to discover that Dora's aunts had decided to allow me to visit her． So every Saturday and Sunday I walked to their house in Putney， and spent the afternoons there． Sometimes Dora sang or played the guitar， sometimes we walked by the river， and sometimes I brought Traddles or my aunt with me． What happy times they were！</p>
<p>我回到伦敦，欣喜地发现朵拉的姑姑决定允许我去看朵拉。所以，每到星期六和星期天，我就徒步走到普特纳她们的家，把下午的时间花在那儿。有时，朵拉唱歌、弹吉他，有时，我们到河边散步，有时我带上特拉德和我姨婆一起去。多快乐的一段时光！</p>
<p>Mr Spenlow had seemed a very rich man to me， but when he died the lawyers discovered that Dora would not inherit much from him after all， as there were many debts to pay． So I did not feel worried that anyone would suspect me of marrying Dora for her money． Mr Spenlow's firm lost a lot of business after his death， and I realized I would have to find another profession． I had always been good at writing， so I continued as secretary to Dr Strong， and also began reporting what was said in parliament， for the daily newspapers． I even wrote some stories， which were published in magazines， and was very pleased with the money I was earning．</p>
<p>斯本罗先生在我看来似乎很富有，但他死后，律师们发现朵拉居然从他那儿继承不到什么，因为还有很多债务要还。所以，我不用担心别人会怀疑我与朵拉结婚是图她的钱。斯本罗先生事务所在主人死后失去了许多业务，我意识到我必须另找一份职业。我的文笔一直不错，所以我继续充当斯特朗博士的秘书，此外，我开始为一些日报报导国会日常议事。我甚至写一些短篇故事，发表在一些杂志上，我很高兴就此挣到钱。</p>
<p>The months passed， and I reached my twenty-first birthday． Traddles was still studying to be a lawyer， and still hoping to marry ‘the dearest girl in the world’． I had moved out of my flat into a pleasant little house， and at last Dora's aunts had agreed to our marriage． I was looking forward to the happiest day of my life． The next few days went by very fast in a mist of excitement and happiness． My aunt and Mr Dick moved into an even smaller house near mine， and Peggotty travelled from Yarmouth to be present at my wedding．</p>
<p>几个月过去了，我迎来了21岁的生日。特拉德依旧在学律师，依旧准备和他那位“世界上最可爱的女孩”结婚。我已从我的公寓搬出，搬到一所比较舒适的小房子里。终于，朵拉的姑姑们同意了我们的婚事。我盼望着这一生中最幸福的一天。接下来的几天在激动和喜悦中过得飞快。姨婆和迪克先生搬进了离我不远的一所更小的房子，辟果提也从雅茅斯赶来，准备参加我的婚礼。</p>
<p>I had always wanted Agnes to meet Dora， so I was glad when they met， the day before the wedding . It was beautiful to see Dora's pretty face next to Agnes's calm one， and Dora whispering her secrets into Agnes's ears，as a child does to its mother． But after Agnes had gone to see my aunt， Dora said seriously to me， when we were alone，‘ Perhaps if I'd had Agnes as a friend when I was younger， David dear， I wouldn't be so foolish and silly.’</p>
<p>我一直想让阿格尼斯见见朵拉，所以我很高兴婚礼前一天她们见面了。朵拉美丽的脸挨着阿格尼斯恬静的脸，真是美妙极了。朵拉对着阿格尼斯的耳朵说着悄悄话，就像一个孩子跟她母亲说话一样。可当阿格尼斯去看我姨婆，房间里就剩我们俩时，朵拉认真地对我说：“也许我要是从小就有阿格尼斯这样的朋友，大卫，亲爱的，我就不会这么蠢，这么笨。”</p>
<p>‘ But I love you as you are， Dora！’ I replied.</p>
<p>“可我爱你这样，朵拉！”我回答。</p>
<p>‘ I wonder why you ever fell in love with me！’</p>
<p>“我不明白你为什么竟然爱上我！”</p>
<p>‘ Because nobody can see you， and not fall in love with you！’</p>
<p>“因为任谁见到你都会产生爱慕之心！”</p>
<p>‘ But if you'd never seen me， David， I wonder who you'd have married…’</p>
<p>“但假如你从未遇见我，大卫，我猜想你要娶的人会是…”</p>
<p>I laughed and kissed her pretty lips， and she was soon as cheerful as usual again.</p>
<p>我笑起来，亲吻她美丽的嘴唇，她很快又像往常一样高兴了。</p>
<p>I cannot remember much about the wedding， except Dora by my side， in her beautiful dress and with a blushing face .Only when we were driving away from Putney together， did I wake from the dream． I believed it at last！ It was my dear little wife I was sitting next to， whom I loved so much！</p>
<p>我不记得婚礼上更多的事情，只记得朵拉在我身边，穿一身漂亮的衣服，羞红了脸。一直到我们驾车离开普特纳，我才从梦中醒来。我最终相信了这一切！坐在我身边的是我衷爱着的、我的亲爱的娇妻！</p>
<p>It seemed strange to return from our week's holiday and to find myself in my own small house with Dora． It was difficult to believe that we were going to spend the rest of our lives together． But soon I realized that married life was not as comfortable as it appeared． Neither Dora nor I knew anything about managing the house． We had a servant， of course， who managed us． She served our meals late， drank all our wine，and stole all our silver spoons． When she finally left， we had another who behaved in a similar way． I felt I had to speak to Dora about it．</p>
<p>度完一周的蜜月，和朵拉一起回到我的小房子，自己似乎总觉着别扭。很难相信这以后我俩要一起度过下半辈子。然而，我很快意识到婚后的生活并不像表面看上去那么舒适。朵拉和我谁也不知道如何管家。当然，我们有一位用人来管我们。她开饭晚点，喝掉了我们所有的酒，还偷走了我们所有的银汤勺。最后她走了，我们又请了一位用人，但情况一模一样。我觉得有必要跟朵拉谈谈了。</p>
<p>‘ My love，’ I began，‘ couldn't you perhaps control the servants a little better？’</p>
<p>“我的宝贝，”我开始了，“你能不能，哪怕是稍微管好一点用人们？”</p>
<p>‘ David， don't be cross with your little Dora，’ she said，coming to sit on my knee． But I wanted to show I could be firm．</p>
<p>“大卫，别冲你的小朵拉发火，”她说着，走过来坐到我膝盖上。但我想显示一下我的严厉。</p>
<p>‘My sweet Dora， I really do think you should do something． I mean， yesterday I had no supper at all because the beef was burnt， and last week， when Traddles came to dinner， the meat wasn't cooked at all！’</p>
<p>“我的心肝朵拉，我真觉得你应该做点什么。我是说，昨天我压根儿没吃晚饭，因为牛肉烧糊了；上星期特拉德来家里吃饭，肉根本就没做熟！”</p>
<p>‘You knew before you married me what a silly girl I am！You shouldn't have married me if you were going to be angry with me！I don't think you love me at all！’ And large tears ran down her pretty little face．</p>
<p>“结婚前你知道我是个多笨的女孩！你要对我发火就不该娶我！我想你根本就不爱我！”大大的泪珠顺着她美丽的脸庞滑下来。</p>
<p>‘ Dora，my love！ Of course I love you！Don't cry！’ I could not continue our conversation then． But when she was calmer，and had dried her tears， she said very seriously， ‘David， will you do something for me？ Will you call me your child-wife？’</p>
<p>“朵拉，我的宝贝！当然我爱你！别哭了！”我不能再继续谈这个话题了。可她平静下来后，擦干眼泪，十分认真地说道：“大卫，能为我做点事吗？你能叫我童妻吗？”</p>
<p>‘ Whatever do you mean， my dearest？’ I asked in surprise．</p>
<p>“你这是什么意思，我最亲爱的？”我奇怪地问道。</p>
<p>‘Just that， whenever you feel I'm being very foolish， you should remember that I'm like a child， not as clever as you， or anyone else．Don't be disappointed with me， just remember that your child-wife loves you very， very much．’</p>
<p>“就这意思，不管什么时候你觉得我很愚蠢，你就记住我像个孩子，不如你聪明，不如任何人。别对我失望，只要记住你的童妻非常非常爱你。”</p>
<p>Of all the conversations we had， I remember that one very clearly． It made a strong impression on me， and I am glad now that I did not try to change Dora any more． I had fallen in love with an innocent child-like girl，and I could not expect her to become a wise， experienced woman in such a short time． But this meant that I had to carry all Our problems on my own shoulders， and sometimes I felt sorry that I did not have a real partner in life， with whom to share these worries．</p>
<p>在所有我们俩的谈话中，这一次我记得很清楚。给我留下了很深的印象，我很高兴我当时没再设法改变朵拉。我爱上了天真的、没长大的女孩，我不能期望在短时间内把她变成一位聪慧、能干的女人。可这意味着我将一个人承担所有的困难，有时我感到很遗憾，生活中没有一位真正的伴侣，一位能分担忧愁的伴侣。</p>
<p>At about this time， my first book was published， and was a great success． Dora and my aunt were equally proud of me． I was becoming， however， rather worried about Dora． She had been ill for some time， and did not seem to be getting better．She was not strong， and could not walk anywhere by herself．I began to carry her downstairs every morning， and upstairs every night， and my aunt came every day to look after her．My little wife was still very pretty， and cheerful， but I knew how light she was， and how weak． I began to fear she would not be with me for much longer．</p>
<p>这期间，我的第一本书问世，而且十分成功。朵拉和姨婆为我同样骄傲。然而，我开始非常担心朵拉的身体状况。她病了一段时间，似乎并没有好转。她浑身没劲，不能自己走动。我开始每天早上背她下楼，每天晚上背她上楼，姨婆也天天来照顾她。我的娇妻依旧很美丽、很开心，但我知道她体重有多轻，身体有多虚弱。我开始害怕她可能不会跟我生活太久了。</p>
<p>Early one morning when I was walking in the garden， I saw Danie I Peggotty opening the gate and coming towards me． His clothes were dusty， and he looked older than before， with white hair escaping untidily from under his hat． But his face was brown， and he looked healthy and strong．</p>
<p>有一天一大早，我在花园里散步，看见丹尼尔&middot;辟果提推开门朝我走来。他的衣服上满是尘土，看上去比以前老了许多，白头发零乱地散落在帽子外边。但他脸色棕红，显得健康。</p>
<p>‘ Master David！’ he said gladly，when he saw me．‘I've come to tell you—you were always our friend—I've found her！’</p>
<p>“大卫少爷！”他看见我高兴地说，“我来告诉你——你是我们永远的朋友——我找到她了！”</p>
<p>‘ You've found little Emily！’ I cried delightedly．‘ But where— and how？’</p>
<p>“你找到小埃米莉了！”我兴奋地叫起来，“在哪儿——怎么找着的？”</p>
<p>‘ I heard she'd travelled with that wicked Steerforth to Italy， and lived there for a while． But in the end he became tired of her， and left her．She didn't know what to do， or where to go， poor thing！ But she came back to London． And that’ s where I found my dear child！ Because I've been all over Europe looking for her， but I knew she'd come back to England one day．So every night I've been searching the city streets for her． And last night I found her， hopeless and exhausted， on a bridge looking down into the river． If I hadn’ t found her then，I don't like to think what she would have done！ But God was looking after my dear girl， and she's safe with me now．’ He passed his strong hand over his eyes， and smiled at me．‘ I've planned what we'll do， Master David，and I want to tell you about it． Emily and I are going to Australia．It's a new country， where nobody knows anything about her past．We'll be able to start a new life together．We'll be leaving in about six weeks．’</p>
<p>“我听说她和恶棍斯提福兹去了意大利，在那儿住了一段。最后他厌倦她了，离开了她。她不知道怎么办，不知该去哪儿，可怜的孩子！但她回到了伦敦。我就是在那儿找到了我亲爱的孩子！因为我已经找遍了整个欧洲，我知道她总有一天会回到英国，所以我每天晚上走街串巷寻找她。昨天晚上我发现了她，万念俱灰、疲惫不堪，站在一座桥上看着河水。要是我当时没发现她，我不敢想象她会怎么办！然而，上帝在照看着我亲爱的孩子，她现在安全了，和我在一起。”他用强劲有力的手抹了一下眼睛，冲我笑了笑。“我已订好计划我们下一步该做什么，大卫少爷，我想把打算告诉你。埃米莉和我准备去澳大利亚，那是个新国家，没有人知道她的过去。我们俩要一起开创一种新生活。我们6个星期后出发。”</p>
<p>‘ Very sensible，’I said．‘ And what about the rest of your family？Are Ham and Peggotty going to Australia too？’</p>
<p>“非常明智的决定，”我说，“那家里其他人怎么办？哈姆和辟果提也去澳大利亚吗？”</p>
<p>‘ No， they aren't．Poor Ham will never be the same again．I really think his heart is broken．But he's got a good job， and is very popular in Yarmouth，so he'll stay there． My sister wants to stay too，partly because of you ，Master David， and partly to look after Ham．She cooks and cleans for him in Yarmouth， you know．’</p>
<p>“不，他们不去。可怜的哈姆不再是以前的他了。我想他的心是彻底的碎了。可他有一份好工作，在雅茅斯很受欢迎，所以他留在那儿。我妹妹也想留下，一半是因为你，大卫少爷，一半是为了照顾哈姆，她在雅茅斯给他做饭、洗衣，你知道。”</p>
<p>‘Well，my friend，’I said，shaking hands firmly with the old boatman，‘ I wish you and Emily all the best in your new life．’</p>
<p>“好啊，我的朋友，”我说着，紧紧地握着这位老船手的手，“我祝你和埃米莉在新的生活中一切顺利！”</p>
<p>‘ I'll do my duty， whether I'm in England or Australia，’said Daniel．‘ And I'll never be separated from my little Emily again！’</p>
<p>“我会尽自己的职责，不管在英国还是澳大利亚，”丹尼尔说，“我再不和我的小埃米莉分开了！”</p><a href='10.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
