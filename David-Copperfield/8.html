<p><b>8 大卫的新生活 </b></p>
<p>With Agnes's encouragement I felt much stronger，and no longer depressed．My life now bad a purpose．I intended to work as hard as I could，to help my aunt and to earn enough money to marry Dora．I got up every morning at five o’clock，walked to Dr Strong's house on the other side of London，worked with him for two hours every morning，and then walked back to Mr Spenlow's office，where I spent most of the day in the lawcourts．Then I returned to Dr Strong's for two or three more hours in the evening，and finally came home to my flat，where my aunt，Peggotty and Mr Dick would be waiting for me．I was glad to be able to tell my aunt that Dr Strong would pay me seventy pounds a year for my work．With that，and the rent from my aunt's house in Kent，we could live quite well，if we were careful．Because I was young and healthy，I did not mind hard work，and whenever I was tired，I told myself，‘You're doing it for Dora！’and that made me work even harder．</p>
<p>有阿格尼斯的鼓励，我的劲头更足了，并不再消沉。我的生活如今有了目标。我准备尽可能努力工作，为帮助我姨婆，也为娶朵拉而挣足够的钱。我每天早上5点钟起床，走着去位于伦敦城另一端的斯特朗博士家，每个上午跟他于两个小时，然后走回来到斯本罗先生的办公室，把我大部分时间花在法庭上。晚上，我又回到斯特朗博士处，干上两到三个小时，最后才回到我的寓所，我姨婆、辟果提和迪克先生在那儿等我。我很高兴地告诉姨婆，斯特朗博士将付给我每年70英镑的酬劳。加上姨婆在肯特的房租，我们能生活得很不错，只消谨慎安排就是了。由于我年轻、健康，我不在乎工作艰辛。累的时候，我对自己说，“一切为了朵拉！”那样我就会更努力地工作。</p>
<p>When I met Traddles one day near the courts，I told him about my new situation，and he was very sympathetic．</p>
<p>一天，我在法院附近遇上特拉德尔，我告诉他我的近况，他表示很同情。</p>
<p>‘But I have news for you too，Copperfield！’he said．‘The Micawbers are moving to Canterbury．’</p>
<p>“可我也有消息告诉你，科波菲尔！”他说，“米考伯一家搬到了坎特伯雷城。”</p>
<p>‘Oh！That means something must have turned up for them！’I replied，interested．</p>
<p>“噢！那就是说他们有了转机！”我很感兴趣地回答。</p>
<p>‘Yes，Mr Micawber is going to become assistant to someone called Uriah Heep，a partner in a firm of Canterbury lawyers．’</p>
<p>“是的，米考伯先生将成为一位名叫尤赖亚&middot;希普的人的助手，他是坎城一家律师事务所的合伙人。”</p>
<p>‘Heep！’I cried in horror．‘I know him！Why would Mr Micawber want to work for him？’</p>
<p>“希普！”我惊恐地叫道，“我知道他！米考伯先生怎么会想到给他干？”</p>
<p>‘Well，I do know that Heep has paid all Mr Micawber's debts in London，’answered Traddles．‘The whole family is leaving tomorrow．They asked me to tell you．’</p>
<p>“嘿，反正我知道希普为米考伯先生偿还了他在伦敦欠下的所有债务，”特拉德尔回答，“他们一家明天就离开。他们要我告诉你。”</p>
<p>I wondered why Heep wanted Micawber to work for him，and I felt sure Uriah had some evil plan in his ugly head．</p>
<p>我不明白希普为什么找米考伯给他干活，但我肯定尤赖亚丑陋的脑子里又在捉摸什么坏计划。</p>
<p>The next day Peggotty was returning to Yarmouth to look after Ham，while Daniel was away．After I had taken her to the coach station and said goodbye to her，I hurried to Miss Mills's house．I had not yet told Dora about the changes in my life，because I had not wanted to explain it all in a letter，but today she was visiting Julia Mills and was expecting me to come to tea．</p>
<p>第二天，辟果提要回雅茅斯照顾哈姆，因为丹尼尔不在。我把她送到长途马车站，跟她道别后，我急冲冲地来到米尔斯小姐的住处。我还未曾告诉朵拉我生活中的变化，因为我不想仅以一封信解释这一切。而今天她要来看看朱莉亚&middot;米尔斯，并约我一起喝茶。</p>
<p>How happy and heautiful Dora looked when she met me in the sitting-room！And how shocked and miserable she looked when I asked her immediately，‘Can you love a beggar，Dora？’My pretty little Dora！She had no idea what I meant．</p>
<p>当我在客厅见着朵拉时，她是那么高兴，那么美丽！当我突然问她：“你会爱一个穷光蛋吗，朵拉？”时，她是那么震惊，那么痛苦！我美丽的小朵拉！她不明白我的意思。</p>
<p>‘Don't be silly，David！’she cried．‘What are you talking about？’</p>
<p>“别犯傻了，大卫！”她叫道，“你在说什么？”</p>
<p>‘It's true，Dora，my love！’I cried．‘I've lost all my money！I'm a beggar！’And I looked so serious that Dora was frightened，and began to sob bitterly on my shoulder．</p>
<p>“真的，朵拉，我的宝贝！”我叫道，“我失去了所有的钱！我成了穷光蛋！”我显得很认真，竟把朵拉吓哭了，她靠在我肩上痛苦地抽泣起来。</p>
<p>‘But I love you，Dora，and always will！’I continued．‘It doesn't matter if we are poor，because I'll work hard to buy our bread．We don't need much as long as we have each other！Tell me your heart is still mine，dear Dora！’</p>
<p>“可我爱你，朵拉，永远爱你！”我继续道，“穷并没关系，因为我会努力工作，买到面包，只要有你有我，我们不需要更多的！告诉我你的心依然属于我，亲爱的朵拉！”</p>
<p>‘Oh yes！’she cried．‘Oh yes，it's all yours！Only，don't frighten me again！Don't talk of hard work and bread！I don't understand！I hardly ever eat bread！’</p>
<p>“噢，是的！”她哭道，“噢，是的，全部属于你！只要你别再吓我！别再谈努力工作和面包！我不懂！我几乎没吃过面包！”</p>
<p>I loved her more than ever．But I felt she was not very practical．In a few moments，when she had stopped crying and was calmer，I tried again to make her understand．</p>
<p>我比以前更爱她了，但我感觉到她很不现实。过了一会儿，当她停止哭泣，渐渐平静下来时，我又一次试图让她明白。</p>
<p>‘My dearest！May I mention something？’</p>
<p>“我最亲爱的！可以跟你说些事吗？”</p>
<p>‘Oh，please don't be practical！begged Dora，tears coming to her lovely eyes．‘It frightens me so much！’</p>
<p>“噢，请别谈现实”！她乞求道，可爱的双眼涌出泪水，“它让我好害怕！”</p>
<p>‘My dear one，if we work together，and share our problems，it will make us，and our love，stronger．</p>
<p>“亲爱的人，如果我们一起工作，一起克服困难，那将会使我们的爱情更坚固。”</p>
<p>‘But I'm not strong at all！’she cried miserably．‘Ask Julia！She'll tell you—I'm weak，and foolish！’</p>
<p>“可我一点儿都不坚强”！她痛苦地哭道，“你问朱莉亚！她会告诉你——我很懦弱，很愚蠢！”</p>
<p>‘But if you thought sometimes，my sweet Dora，that you are engaged to a poor man—if you tried to see how your father manages the servants，or how much food costs in the markets，it would be helpful to us．We must be brave，dear Dora！Our path in life is steep and rocky—’</p>
<p>“可如果你有时想一想，我的心肝朵拉，你要嫁的是一位穷人——如果你用心注意一下你父亲是怎么管理用人们，市场上的食品需要多少钱，那对我们将很有帮助。我们必须勇敢，亲爱的朵拉！我们的生活道路坎坎坷坷，很不平坦——”</p>
<p>I was becoming quite enthusiastic，but I suddenly realized I had said far too much．Poor little Dora was sobbing and screaming with fear，and in a moment was lying unconscious on the sofa．I really thought I had killed her．I threw water on her face and went down on my knees to ask her to forgive me．I called myself a selfish，heartless creature，and shouted for Julia Mills．At last she hurried in，and I explained what had happened．When Dora opened her eyes，her friend helped her upstairs．</p>
<p>我开始情绪激昂，可突然我发现自己说得太过火了。可怜的小朵拉恐怖地抽泣，尖叫着，不一会儿倒在沙发上，失去了知觉。我真以为自己杀了她。我往她脸上洒水，并跪下来请求她原谅。我骂自己是自私、无情的畜生，并大声呼喊朱莉亚&middot;米尔斯。最后她赶来了，我解释了发生的一切。朵拉睁开眼睛时，她朋友扶着她上了楼。</p>
<p>While Dora was upstairs，washing her face and calming herself，I asked Miss Mills's advice on the best way to encourage Dora to become more practical．Miss Mills shook her head sadly．</p>
<p>当朵拉上楼洗脸以使自己镇静的时候，我征求米尔斯小姐的意见，怎样通过最合适的渠道让朵拉变得更切实际。米尔斯小姐忧郁地摇了摇头。</p>
<p>‘I must be honest with you，Mr Copperfield．Our dearest Dora is a beautiful，innocent child of nature，full of light and happiness．She is above the things of this world，which we poor humans have to worry about．I think you'll just have to accept that fact．’</p>
<p>“实不相瞒，科波菲尔先生。我们最亲爱的朵拉是一位美丽、天真的自然之子，充满了生机和快乐。她超越了世间万物，不像我们凡俗之辈这样操心。我想你只能接受这一事实。”</p>
<p>When Dora came downstairs again，she looked so lovely that I felt bitterly angry with myself for making her unhappy， even for a moment．We had tea，and she sang her French songs to me，and played the guitar．We were happy again，until the moment when I stupidly mentioned that I had to get up at five o’clock the next morning．Suddenly her pretty face looked sad，and she did not play or sing again．When I got up to go，she came up close to me，and said lovingly，‘You bad boy，don't be so silly！Don't get up at five o’clock！Why should you？’</p>
<p>当朵拉又下楼时，她看上去是那么的可爱以致我痛恨自己带给她痛苦，甚至是片刻的痛苦。我们开始喝茶，她给我唱法文歌曲，弹奏吉他。我们重新快乐起来，直到我愚蠢地提到我第二天必须五点钟起床。突然，她美丽的脸上露出忧伤，不再继续弹唱。当我起身要走时，她来到我跟前，动情地说道：“你这个坏东西，别这么犯傻了！用不着五点就起来！为什么你该这样？”</p>
<p>‘But my love，I have work to do！I have to work in order to live！’ I replied．</p>
<p>“可是，我的宝贝，我有工作要做！为了生存我必须工作！”我回答。</p>
<p>‘ Work？Don't be so foolish， David dear！’and she seemed to think that was the end of the matter， as she gave me a kiss straight from her innocent little heart．</p>
<p>“工作？别犯傻了，大卫，亲爱的！”她似乎觉得事情就这么解决了，并发自她天真的内心给了我一个吻。</p>
<p>I loved her， and went on loving her． But I went on working hard too， and worrying about earning money． Some evenings，as I sat opposite my aunt in my little sitting-room at the end of another exhausting day， I was quite frightened， when I thought of the problems I was going to have to solve alone．</p>
<p>我爱她，而且一直都爱她。可我也得坚持拼命工作，拼命挣钱。有几天晚上，当我累了一整天，在我那小客厅里与我姨婆相对而坐时，我感到十分害怕，想着我必须一个人克服这些困难。</p>
<p>Several months passed in this way． Dora and I wrote to each other every day， and occasionally I was able to visit her at Miss Mills's house． But one morning when I arrived at the office for work， Mr Spenlow greeted me very coldly and asked me to step into his office， where we could talk privately．When I entered the room，I was surprised to see Miss Murd-stone standing by his desk， staring unpleasantly at me． I knew at once that Dora's father had discoversd our secret， and I guessed who had told him．</p>
<p>就这样过去了好几个月。朵拉和我每天通信，时而我也能去米尔斯小姐的住所看她。可有一天早上，当我来到办公室工作时，斯本罗先生冷冷地和我打了一声招呼，并要我到他办公室跟我单独谈谈。我走进房间，意外地发现摩德斯通小姐站在他的书桌边，很不愉快地盯着我。我立刻意识到朵拉的父亲已经发现了我们的秘密，而且猜到是谁告的状。</p>
<p>‘ Mr Copperfield，’ said Mr Spenlow， frowning sternly at me，‘ I am sorry to say that Miss Murdstone has found some letters which appear to be from you to my daughter Dora． Are they yours？’</p>
<p>“科波菲尔先生，”斯本罗先生朝我严肃地皱皱眉，说道，“我很抱歉告诉你，摩德斯通小姐发现了一些似乎是你写给我女儿朵拉的信。是你写的吗？”</p>
<p>I looked at the letters he handed to me， blushed， and whispered，‘ Yes， sir，’ Poor little Dora！I hoped she had not been frightened by that horrible Murdstone woman． I hated to think Of Dora's unhappiness at losing my letters．</p>
<p>我看了一下他递给我的几封信，红着脸轻声说道：“是的，先生。”可怜的小朵拉！希望她没被这位可怕的摩德斯通女人吓着。我不愿想象朵拉在丢失我的信后的痛苦状。</p>
<p>‘ I suspected something was wrong when Miss Spenlow came back from her last visit to Miss Mills，’ said Miss Murd-stone， looking very pleased with herself．‘ I always said Julia Mills was not a suitable friend for Miss Spenlow， and I was right！’</p>
<p>“我就觉察到斯本罗小姐上次从米尔斯小姐那儿回来时有些不太对劲。”摩德斯通小姐说，显得对自己很满意。“我一直说朱莉亚&middot;米尔斯不是斯本罗小姐合适的朋友，我说对了！”</p>
<p>Mr Spenlow appeared to agree， but rather sadly．</p>
<p>斯本罗先生表示同意，可他十分忧郁。</p>
<p>‘ I am very sorry， sir，’ I said，‘ but it is all my fault． Please don't blame Dora—’</p>
<p>“非常抱歉，先生，”我说，“那都是我的错。请别责怪朵拉——”</p>
<p>‘ Miss Spenlow to you， young man！’ said her father angrily.</p>
<p>“你只能称她斯本罗小姐，年轻人！”她父亲气愤地说道。</p>
<p>‘ I know it wasn't right to keep it secret， sir， but I love your daughter，and I hope that one day—’</p>
<p>“我知道保守秘密不对，先生，但我爱您的女儿，我希望有一天——”</p>
<p>‘ Don't speak to me of love， Mr Copperfield！ cried Mr Spenlow．‘ You are both much too young！ We'll throw these letters in the fire， and you must promise to forget the whole thing． There is no question of your marrying Dora！’</p>
<p>“别跟我谈爱，科波菲尔先生！”斯本罗先生叫起来。“你们俩都太年轻！我们会把这些信件烧掉，你必须保证忘掉这整件事。你不可能娶朵拉！”</p>
<p>‘ But sir，I can't forget her！I love her！’ I protested．</p>
<p>“可是，先生，我不能忘掉她！我爱她！”我反驳道。</p>
<p>‘That is my last word， M Copperfield！ When you have time to consider， you'll realize it's wiser to do as I say． Now go to your work！’</p>
<p>“这是我的最后通牒，科波菲尔先生！你要有时间考虑一下，就会意识到照我说的做是明智的。现在，干活去吧！”</p>
<p>I spent all day thinking of poor sweet Dora， and how she must be feeling． In the evening I hurried round to Miss Mills's house， but although she spoke wisely of love and broken hearts， she could not offer me any practical advice.</p>
<p>我一整天都在想可怜的心肝朵拉，想她会是什么感觉。到了晚上，我急急忙忙来到米尔斯小姐处，可虽然她对爱情和破碎的心有高见，但她也不能给我提供切合实际的建议。</p>
<p>The next day， after a sleepless night， I arrived at the office at the normal time， and discovered all the clerks standing talking at the front door． This was so unusual that I stopped to ask what had happened.</p>
<p>第二天，经过无眠的一夜后，我按老时间照常来到办公室，可我发现所有的职员都站在前门聊天。这一现象很反常，我停下来问他们发生了什么。</p>
<p>‘ Why，don't you know？’ asked one of them．‘The police have found Mr Spenlow dead！’I fell back， shocked．</p>
<p>“怎么，你不知道？”其中一位回答，“警察发现斯本罗先生死了！”我大为震惊，向后倒去。</p>
<p>‘ You look very pale， Mr Copperfield！’ said another．‘Sit down here， sir！’</p>
<p>“你脸色苍白，科波菲尔先生！”另一位说道，“坐这儿吧，先生。”</p>
<p>‘ Tell me——tell me what happened， I gasped．</p>
<p>“告诉我——告诉我怎么回事，”我喘着粗气说道。</p>
<p>‘Well， he went into town to dinner last night， and the carriage and horses came back at midnight without him. He was driving himself， you see． So the servants went to look for him， and found him dead in the road． He must have been ill，and have fallen out of the carriage． Anyway， he was dead when they found him.’</p>
<p>“嗯，他昨晚去城里吃晚饭，午夜时分马和马车回来了，车上没有他。他是自己驾着车去的，你知道。所以用人们出去找他，发现他已死在路边。他一定是病了，从马车上摔了下来。不管怎样，反正他们找到他时他已经死了。”</p>
<p>This was a terrible shock to me． Perhaps his anger with me had made him ill.In that case I was partly to blame for his death． But I am sorry to say I was also jealous of Dora's sadness． White she was crying for her dead father， she was not thinking of me， and I selfishly wanted to be the only person in her life．</p>
<p>这对我可是一种可怕的打击。或许是因为他对我的愤怒使他发玻要是那样的话，对他的死我就要负部分的责任。可我很抱歉，我还嫉妒朵拉的悲伤。因为当她为死去的父亲哭泣的时候，心里就没有我了，而我却自私地想成为她生活中唯一的人。</p>
<p>In the next few weeks I became quite desperate because I could not see or speak to my sweet Dora． Miss Mills reported that Dora cried all day， and when my name was mentioned，only sobbed more loudly and said，‘Oh poor dear Father！How wicked of me to keep a secret from him！ Oh！ Oh！’ So I did not feel encouraged to visit her． Soon after her father's funeral， Dora was taken to live with her two aunts at Putney，in south London， where she seemed to be further away from me than ever.</p>
<p>接下来的几周我变得十分绝望，因为我不能与我的心肝朵拉见面或聊天。据米尔斯小姐说，朵拉整天哭泣，当别人提到我的名字时，她只会哭得更厉害，并且说道：“噢，可怜的、亲爱的父亲！我有多坏呀，竟然对他严守秘密！噢！噢！”所以我没有勇气去看她。她父亲的葬礼结束不久，朵拉被带到伦敦南部的普特纳，和她的两位姑姑生活在一起。她似乎离我更远了。</p>
<p>My aunt， meanwhile， began to be seriously worried about my health， as I was getting more and more depressed． So she suggested I should go to Dover for a few days， to make sure that her house was still in good condition， and then to Canter-bury， to visit the Wickfields． I agreed willingly， as I was always happy to see Agnes． It was easy to take a few day's hoilday from my work at the lawcourts and with Dr Strong．</p>
<p>与此同时，姨婆开始真正地担心起我的身体状况，因为我一天比一天抑郁。所以她建议我去多佛呆几天，看看她的房子是否依然完好，然后再去坎特伯雷城看看威克菲尔父女。我欣然同意了，因为我总是很高兴见着阿格尼斯。而且从我工作的法院和斯特朗博士那儿请几天假比较容易。</p>
<p>I was glad to find that the person who was renting my aunt's house in Dover was looking after it well． I was then free to continue my journey to Canterbury， that beautiful ancient city， which seemed very little changed since my schooldays． The soft， clean air made me feel better than I had done for weeks．</p>
<p>我很欣慰，发现租用我姨婆在多佛那套房子的人把房子照看得很好。这样，我就有更多的时间继续我旅行的下一站，坎特伯雷，那个美丽而古老的城市，自从我上学时代到现在似乎也没什么改变。这儿轻柔、洁净的空气令我的感觉好了许多，走出了这几个星期以来的阴影。</p>
<p>When I arrived at the Wickfields’House， I found Mr Micawber in Uriah Heep's old office.</p>
<p>我到威克菲尔住所时，看见米考伯先生在尤赖亚&middot;希普原来的办公室。</p>
<p>We were pleased to see each other， but we both felt a little embarrassed. I realized that he did not want to talk about confidential matters concerning the firm of Heep and Wickfield， and he knew that I disliked his employer， Heep． So conversation was difficult，and in the end I was glad to leave him， and go upstairs to look for Agnes.</p>
<p>我们彼此都很高兴见到对方，但都感到有点尴尬。我注意到他不想透露有关希普&middot;威克菲尔律师事务所的机密消息，他知道我不喜欢他的雇主希普。所以谈话很难展开，最后，我很高兴跟他告别，来到楼上找阿格尼斯。</p>
<p>I found her in her sitting-room， and she looked up at me with such a warm welcome in her smile that I was very moved．</p>
<p>我在客厅里发现了她，她抬眼看我，热情地朝着我微笑，以示欢迎，我颇为感动。</p>
<p>‘Ah， Agnes！’ I sald．‘ I've missed you so much recently！You helped me such a lot in the old days that I suppose I never learnt to think for myself． I always feel I need your help and advice． I get into such trouble， and I get so worried， and have so little confidence in myself， but when I'm with you， you give me purpose！ You make me strong！ What is your secret，my dear adopted sister？’</p>
<p>“啊，阿格尼斯！”我说，“我最近非常想你！你在过去给过我那么多帮助，我想我从未学会独立思考。我总感觉需要你的帮助，你的建议。现在我陷入了困境，十分担心，没有一点自信，但跟你在一起时，你却使我目标明确！你让我充满力量！你的秘诀是什么，我亲爱的姐姐？”</p>
<p>Agnes gave me her hand， which I kissed， and she went on，in her sisterly way， to listen sympathetically as I told her everything that had happened in the past few weeks． As usual，she knew the right thing to do．She advised me to write to Dora's aunts， to ask if I could visit Dora occasionally， and she encouraged me in my hopes of marriage． I felt again that peace which Agnes always brought to me．</p>
<p>阿格尼斯伸给我一只手，我吻了一下，她继续像大姐姐一样，十分同情地倾听我诉说过去这几周里发生的每一件事情。像往常一样，她知道该怎么做。她建议我给朵拉的姑姑写信，询问是否能常去看朵拉，她还鼓励我实现结婚的希望，我又一次感受到阿格尼斯带给我的心灵的宁静。</p>
<p>We had not been sitting together long when Mrs Heep came in．She did not leave us for a moment all that evening， and I wondered whether Uriah had told her to watch over us．Whenever I looked at Agnes's lovely face， I saw Mrs Heep's evil black eyes staring at me．</p>
<p>我们俩还没坐多会儿，希普太太就进来了。她整个晚上都没有离开我们一步。我不知道是否是尤赖亚派她来监视我们的。我每次注视阿格尼斯可爱的脸时，总看见希普太太邪恶的黑眼睛紧盯着我不放。</p>
<p>The next day， Mrs Heep did not leave Agnes and me alone even for a minute． The Heeps， mother and son， seemed to me like two ugly great black birds hanging over the house， and they made me so uncomfortable that I went out for a walk in the afternoon． I was walking along a path near the house，wondering if I should warn Agnes about Uriah's plan of marriage，when I heard footsteps behind me，and turned to see Uriah himself running after me．</p>
<p>第二天，希普太太没给阿格尼斯和我留下片刻单独在一起的时间。这希普母子，在我看来，就像是徘徊在房子里的两只丑陋的大黑鸟，他们使我感到十分不舒服，所以到了下午，我就独自走出去散步。我沿着房子附近的一条小道走着，捉摸着我是否应该告诉阿格尼斯尤赖亚的结婚计划，这时我听见身后的脚步声，转身看见尤赖亚自己跑来追我。</p>
<p>‘Wait for me， Mr Copperfield！’ he cried．</p>
<p>“等等我，科波菲尔先生！”他叫道。</p>
<p>‘Actually，’ I said，‘I came out to be alone．’</p>
<p>“其实，”我说，“我出来是想单独呆会儿。”</p>
<p>‘ Ah！’ he said， with his oily smile，‘ you don't like my mother being there all the time， do you？’</p>
<p>“啊！”他僵硬地一笑，说，“你不喜欢我母亲总在那里，是吧？”</p>
<p>‘No，I don't，’I replied，not caring if I sounded rude.</p>
<p>“是的，不喜欢，”我回答，没在乎自己的说话是否粗鲁。</p>
<p>‘ But you see，’ he continued，‘ in my humble position，I have to be very careful． I'm not married to my Agnes yet，and you're a dangerous rival， Mr Copperfield．’</p>
<p>“可你知道，”他继续说道，“处在我这样卑微的位置，我不得不十分谨慎。我还没有把阿格尼斯娶过门，而你是一位危险的对手，科波菲尔先生。”</p>
<p>‘What！’I cried in disgust．‘ You allow Miss Wickfield no peace in her own home because of me？Don't you realize I think of her as my very dear sister， nothing more？ Let me tell you I am engaged to another lady！ There！ Is that enough for you？’</p>
<p>“什么！”我厌恶地叫道，“你不让威克菲尔小姐在自己家里有片刻的宁静是因为我？你没发现我只是把她当成我十分亲密的姐姐，仅此而已？我告诉你吧，我已经和另一位女士订了婚！瞧！放心了吧？”</p>
<p>‘ Oh Mr Copperfield！’ cried Uriah， gratefully shaking my hand with his cold fishy one．‘ I'll tell Mother to stop watching you at once！ Why didn't you tell me that before？ I know you've never liked and trusted me，as I've liked you！’</p>
<p>“噢，科波菲尔先生！”尤赖亚叫道，用他那冰凉的手，颇为感激地握了握我的手，“我马上告诉母亲停止对你的监视！你干吗不早跟我说呢？我知道你从来都没有喜欢过我，相信过我，而我却喜欢你！”</p>
<p>We returned to the house together in silence． That evening after dinner， when Agnes and Mrs Heep had left us， Uriah said to Mr Wickfield，‘Let's have some wine， partner，and drink to young Mr Copperfield's health． It isn't often we have the pleasure of his company， is it， partner？’</p>
<p>我们俩一起走回屋里，谁也没说话。那天吃完晚饭后，阿格尼斯和希普太太出去了，尤赖亚对威克菲尔先生说：“我们来点酒吧，我的伙伴，祝年轻的科波菲尔先生健康。我们不是能常常有幸请着他的，是吧，朋友？”</p>
<p>I knew Uriah was deliberately encouraging Mr Wickfield to drink too much， but I saw that although Agnes's father was aware of his weakness， he could no longer stop himself． As the evening passed， I was disgusted to see that Uriah became more and more cheerful as Mr Wickfield became more and more drunk． Finally Uriah stood up with a glass in his hand．</p>
<p>我知道尤赖亚故意鼓动威克菲尔先生酗酒，但我看出尽管阿格尼斯的父亲意识到自己身体虚弱，但他已不能克制自己。一晚上下来，我看见，随着威克菲尔先生越喝越醉，尤赖亚变得越来越高兴，这使我很气愤。最后，尤赖亚手中举着一杯酒站起来。</p>
<p>‘ Come， partner！’ he said with his evil smile．‘Let's drink to the health of the most beautiful woman in the world！’</p>
<p>“来，我的伙伴！”他阴险地笑了笑，说，“让我们为世界上最美丽的女人的健康干杯！”</p>
<p>Poor， broken Mr wickfield looked for a moment at the picture of his dead wife on the wall， so similar to Agnes．</p>
<p>可怜的、心碎的威克菲尔先生抬头看了一会儿墙上已过世的妻子的像片，她那么像阿格尼斯。</p>
<p>‘ I may be humble，’ continued Uriah，‘but I admire， no， I love your daughter Agnes！’</p>
<p>“我也许卑微，”尤赖亚继续道，“但我敬重，不，我爱你的女儿阿格尼斯！”</p>
<p>Suddenly a horrible cry came from Mr Wickfield．He had stood up， and was screaming with anger． He behaved so wildly and desperately that I thought he had gone mad．‘ My child and you， Heep！ No， never！ You've taken everything from me ， my business， my good name， my home， but you'll never take her！’</p>
<p>突然，威克菲尔先生发出一声可怕的叫喊，他站起身来，愤怒地尖叫着。他的行为如此疯狂、绝望，我真觉得他已经疯了。“我的孩子和你，希普！不，不可能！你夺走了我的一切，我的事业，我的名誉，我的房子，但你决夺不走她！”</p>
<p>‘ Perhaps I've said too much too soon，’ said Uriah， looking uncomfortable．‘But you'll be sorry， partner， if you say any more！ You need me， remember？ You've got nothing without me！ Remember that before you accuse me of anything！’</p>
<p>“或许我说得太多太早了，”尤赖亚不自在地说道，“但你要再说话，你会后侮的，伙伴！你需要我，记得吗？没有我你什么都得不到！在你指责我任何事之前记住这一点！”</p>
<p>Just then the door opened and Agnes entered silently．</p>
<p>正在这时，门开了，阿格尼斯静静地走进来。</p>
<p>‘ You're not well， Father， come with me，’ she whispered gently， and helped the ashamed old man out． I thought she must have heard what had been said．</p>
<p>“你不舒服，父亲，来，跟我走，”她温和地轻声说道，扶着这位狼狈的老人走出了房间。我想她一定听见了刚才的话。</p>
<p>Later that night she came to say goodnight to me in the sitting-room， where I was alone， reading．</p>
<p>那天晚上晚些时候，我正一个人在客厅里看书，她进来道晚安。</p>
<p>‘ Agnes， my dear sister，’ I said to her，‘ promise me that you will never agree to marry that evil creature， for any reason！’</p>
<p>“阿格尼斯，我亲爱的姐姐，”我对她说，“答应我你决不同意嫁给那个恶毒的畜生，不管出于什么原因！”</p>
<p>Through her tears she smiled calmly at me．‘ Don't worry，brother，I'm not afraid of him． My duty is to take care of Father， and I trust in God for the rest． Goodnight， David．’</p>
<p>透过泪水，她平静地冲我笑笑，“别担心，弟弟，我不怕他。我的职责就是照顾父亲，我相信上帝会安排一切。晚安，大卫。”</p><a href='9.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
