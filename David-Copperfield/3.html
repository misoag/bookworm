<p><b>3 孤儿大卫 </b></p>
<p>Life went on as normal for me at school，until my birthday two months later in March. I remember that day very well. It was cold，icy weather, and we boys had to blow on our fingers and rub our hands to keep warm in the freezing classrooms. When a message came for me to go and see Mr Creakle， I thought that Peggotty must have sent me a birthday present，and so I hurried gladly along to his room. But there I realized something unusual had happened，because it was Mr Creakle’ s wife who was waiting to speak to me.</p>
<p>学校生活一切照常，直到两个月后我三月份生日的那天。我对那天的情景记忆犹新。那是个寒冷冰冷的一天，孩子们坐在冰冷的教室里不得不哈着热气搓手取暖。有人带给我口信让我去见克里古尔先生，我以为是辟果提给我送生日礼物来了，所以兴冲冲地来到了他的房间。一到那儿我意识到事情有些异常，因为是克里古尔先生的妻子等在那里，准备跟我谈话。</p>
<p>‘David， my child, ’ she said kindly, holding my hand, ‘we all have to accept that our loved ones can die at any moment.’ I looked at her， trying to understand what she meant.</p>
<p>“大卫，孩子，”她握住我的手温和地说道，“我们都必须有思想准备，我们的亲人会随时离开我们。” 我看着她，竭力想理解她的意思。</p>
<p>‘I'm sorry to tell you，’she continued, ‘that your mother is dangerously ill.’ There was a mist in front of my eyes， and suddenly burning tears ran down my face. I knew the truth.</p>
<p>“我很难过，”她继续道，“你母亲病得很厉害。”我的眼前一片模糊，忽地，眼泪顺着脸颊往下流。我知道了真相。</p>
<p>‘Your mother is dead，’ she said. I was already sobbing loudly and I felt I was an orphan，quite alone in the world.</p>
<p>“你母亲死了，”她说。我大声地哭开了，感觉到自己已是个孤儿，孤单单一个人活在这世上。</p>
<p>Mrs Creakle packed my case herself， and sent me home on the coach for the funeral. I did not realize at the time that I would never return to Salem House.</p>
<p>克里古尔夫人亲自为我收拾行李，把我送上马车，回家参加葬礼。我当时没有想到我再也不能回萨伦学校了。</p>
<p>When I arrived home，Peggotty met me at the door, and we cried miserably in each other’ s arms. Mr Murdstone seemed very sad， and did not speak to me at all. Miss Murdstone, however，showed her usual firmness of character（ which she and her brother were so proud of） by checking that I had brought all my clothes back from school. After that she showed no interest in me at all.There was a deathly stillness in the house. Peggotty took me up to the room where my dear mother's dead body lay，with my little brother, who had died a few hours after her. Everything was fresh and clean in the room， but I could not look at my mother's lovely face, which would never smile at me again， without crying.</p>
<p>我到家时，辟果提在门口迎我，我们俩33抱头痛哭。摩德斯通先生似乎很悲伤，几乎不跟我说话。摩德斯通小姐则带着她一惯严肃的表情（她和她兄弟都以此为荣）检查了一下我是否把我在学校的衣物都拿回来了。之后，她对我不再有任何兴趣。家里面死一般地寂静。辟果提把我带到楼上安放我母亲遗体的房间，还有我的小弟弟的遗体，他是在母亲去世数小时后死去的。房间里每一件东西都清新整洁，可我看不见母亲动人的脸，它再也不会对着我微笑，再也不会哭泣。</p>
<p>‘How did it happen，Peggotty？’I asked, sobbing.</p>
<p>“怎么会这样，辟果提？”我抽泣着问道。</p>
<p>‘She was ill for a long time， Master David. She got worse after the baby was born， you see. She was sometimes unhappy and forgetful， but she was always the same to me, her old Peggotty. Those two downstairs often spoke crossly to her and made her sad， but she still loved them， you know—she was so sweet and loving！I always sat beside her while she went to sleep. It made her feel better， she said. There was a short silence while Peggotty dried her eyes， then took both my hands in hers.‘On the last night，she asked me for some water, and then gave me such a patient smile！She looked so beautiful！The sun was beginning to rise， and she put her head on my arm， on her stupid cross old Peggotty's arm, and died like an innocent child going to sleep！’</p>
<p>“她病了很长时间，大卫少爷。生完孩子后身体更虚了，你知道。她有时会闷闷不乐，而且容易忘事。但在我，在她的老辟果提看来，她一直没变。楼下那两位时常怒斥她，令她难堪，可她依然爱他们，你知道——她是那么的恬静可爱！她睡觉时我总坐在她身边，她说这样她感觉好受多了。”辟果提停了片刻，擦了擦眼泪，然后握住我的双手，“最后那天晚上，她向我要了点水喝，然后冲我那么欣慰地笑了笑！她看上去美极了！太阳开始升起，她把手枕在我的胳膊上，枕在她笨拙的老辟果提的胳膊上，像天真的孩童一般睡着了，永远地睡着了。”</p>
<p>After my mother's funeral，I began to wonder what would happen to me. The Murdstones did not even seem to notice that I was in the house. They had told Peggotty to leave，as they did not what her as their servant any more，so Peggotty was going to her brother's in Yarmouth， until she decided what work to do next. She suggested taking me with her for a holiday， and to my surprise the Murdstones agreed.</p>
<p>母亲的葬礼结束后，我开始考虑我今后的安排。摩德斯通姐弟像是压根儿没注意到我的存在。他们叫辟果提离开，因为他们不想继续雇佣她。所以辟果提准备先去雅茅斯她兄弟家，直到她决定下一步干什么为止。她提出来想带我一起去度假，奇怪的是摩德斯通姐弟居然答应了。</p>
<p>So next morning Mr Barkis appeared at the door with his cart， and Peggotty's cases were put on it. We climbed up and sat beside him. Peggotty was naturally a little sad to leave her old home， where she had been so happy with my mother and me， and at first she cried a little. But when Mr Barkis saw her drying her eyes and looking more cheerful， he too began to look happier， and he whispered to me, ‘Barkis is willing！You told her that！’ Aloud he said to Peggotty，‘Are you comfortable？’</p>
<p>就这样，第二天一早巴克斯先生驾着他的马车出现在门口，辟果提的行李随即被搬上了车。我们爬上马车，坐在他身边。就要离开旧居，离开她曾经和我母亲度过快乐时光的地方，辟果提自然有些伤感，刚启动她就轻轻地哭泣起来。可后来，当巴克斯先生看见她擦干了眼泪，情绪好了些时，他自己也愉快了许多，他悄声对我说：“巴克斯很愿意！你是那么说的吧！”他提高嗓门对辟果提说：“你感觉舒服点了吗？”</p>
<p>Peggotty laughed and said that she was.‘And are you comfortable，Master David？’be asked.</p>
<p>辟果提笑了，并回答说是的。“你舒服点了吗，大卫少爷？”他问。</p>
<p>I said that I was. Mr Barkis was so pleased with this conversation that he repeated it many times during the journey，and Peggotty and I both had to keep giving him the same answer.</p>
<p>我说是的。巴克斯先生对这句话是如此的满意以致于一路上重复问了好几遍，辟果提和我只好一遍一遍给他同样的答复。</p>
<p>When we arrived in Yarmouth and got down from the cart，we said goodbye to Mr Barkis. Daniel and Ham Peggotty were waiting for us. Daniel and Ham were exactly the same as I remembered them，cheerful and generous as ever, but little Emily seemed different somehow She was taller and prettier， but she did not want to play with me， or spend her time with me. I was rather disappointed， because I still considered she was the most beautiful girl I had ever seen， and I thought I was in love with her. Daniel and Ham were very proud of her intelligence and beauty， and just smiled when she laughingly refused to sit next to me. But they all listened with interest to my stories of school life at Salem House. I told them about the other boys， especially the handsome, clever Steerforth. I admired him so much that I could not stop myself telling them all about him. Suddenly I noticed that Emily was listening eagerly， her blue eyes shining and a smile on her lips. She blushed when she saw that we were all looking at her， and hid her face behind her hands.</p>
<p>我们到达雅茅斯，下了马车，与巴克斯先生道别。丹尼尔和哈姆&middot;辟果提在那里迎接我们。丹尼尔和哈姆和我记忆中的模样无异，依旧那么开心，那么坦荡，而小埃米莉却多少有些不同。她长高了，也更漂亮了，可她不再愿意和我一起玩，不情愿跟我呆在一起。我很失望，因为我仍然认为她是我见过的最美丽的女孩，我想我爱上了她。丹尼尔和哈姆很为她的聪慧和美丽而自豪，当她笑着拒绝坐到我身边时，他们只是报以一笑。但他们都饶有兴趣地听我讲叙萨伦学校的故事。我跟他们讲其他孩子，尤其是那位英俊聪明的斯提福兹，我是如此佩服他以致于不停地告诉他们有关他的所有的事。突然，我注意到小埃米莉听得非常出神，她的蓝眼睛扑闪扑闪的，嘴角挂着笑容。当她发现我们大家都看着她时，她脸红了，并用双手捂住了自己的脸。</p>
<p>‘Emily's like me，’said Peggotty kindly, ‘and would like to see David's friend Mr Steerforth.’</p>
<p>“小埃米莉跟我一样，”辟果提友好地说，“都想见见大卫的这位朋友——斯提福兹先生。”</p>
<p>The days passed happily，although Emily and I did not play together as we had done before. Mr Barkis was a frequent visitor，and soon Peggotty explained to me that she had decided to marry him.</p>
<p>那些天过得很愉快，尽管埃米莉和我不像以前那样一块儿玩了。巴克斯先生是这儿的常客，很快，辟果提向我解释，她决定嫁给他。</p>
<p>‘I’ ll love you just as much， David, my dear, when I'm married！’ she told me， holding me close to her.‘And I'll be able to come and see you in the cart any time I like. Barkis is a good man and I'm sure I'll be happy with him. He’ s got a nice little house，and I'll keep a little bedroom there for you to use whenever you want. You'll always be welcome to come and stay！’</p>
<p>“我结婚后会照样爱你，大卫，亲爱的，”他把我拉到跟前说，“我随时都会坐车去看你。巴克斯是个好人，我相信跟他一起生活会很快乐。他有一所很不错的小房子，我会在那儿给你留一个小卧室，以备你随时歇脚之用。你的到来是永远受欢迎的。”</p>
<p>So when I returned to Blunderstone， Peggotty had become Mrs Barkis， and I was glad to think of her in her own house，with a husband to take care of her. At home， my stepfather and his sister did not seem pleased to see me， and were clearly trying to find a way of getting rid of me. As they considered school too expensive， they finally arranged for me to start work， although I was still only ten years old, and very small for my age. I was sent to London，to work in a warehouse in the east of the city， near the river.</p>
<p>就这样，当我回到布兰德斯通时，辟果提已经成了巴克斯太太了。想到她能住上自己的房子，并有丈夫照顾她，我就很高兴。到家中，继父和他姐姐似乎并不乐意见到我，很明显，他们正设法寻找打发我的办法。因为考虑到学校开销太大，最后他们决定给我安排工作，尽管我当时只有10岁，并且看上去不到10岁。我被送到伦敦，在市区东郊一条小河旁的仓库里工作。</p>
<p>My job was to wash bottles， which would then be filled with wine， or to pack the filled bottles in cases. I was paid only six shillings a week. There were several other boys who worked with me，but I was the only one who had been to school. All the warehouse workers were coarse， rough people, who were used to working in dirty conditions for long hours. No words can describe the horror I felt， when I realized what my life was going to be like from now on. I was deeply ashamed at having such a job and I was also afraid that I would forget everything I had learnt from my mother and my teachers. I would never find friends like Traddles or Steerforth， or be able to get a better position in life. It was an extremely unhappy time for me.</p>
<p>我的工作是洗刷那些用来装酒的瓶子，或者把灌了酒的瓶子集装成箱。他们只付我一星期6先令的工钱。那儿还有其他一些孩子和我一起干活，但我是唯一上过学的。所有仓库工人都很粗鲁、庸俗，他们已经习惯于在肮脏的环境下连续工作数小时。当我意识到我的生活从此之后便是这个模样，我就产生一种不可名状的恐惧。我为做这样的工作感到十分羞愧，我害怕我会把母亲和老师们教给我的知识都忘光。我再也找不到像特拉德和斯提福兹那样的朋友了，也不可能有更好的生活境遇。那一段生活我过得很不愉快。</p>
<p>My stepfather had asked Mr Quinion， the manager, to find me somewhere to stay in London，so at the end of my first day I was called to Mr Quinion's office and introduced to an important-looking， rather fat, middle-aged man with a head as bald as an egg. His name was Mr Micawber，and he offered me a spare room in the house he was renting with his family.</p>
<p>我继父要求经理奎宁先生为我在伦敦寻找一处住处，所以第一天工作结束后我被叫到奎宁先生的办公室，并认识了一位大人物长相、脑袋像鸡蛋一样光亮的肥胖的中年男子，他叫米考伯先生。他给我提供了他们家正租用着的一所房子的一间空房，我答应接受，于是米考伯先生和我就一同回家了。</p>
<p>I agreed to take it， and Mr Micawber and I walked home together. The Micawbers were obviously very poor， but tried hard not to let this show. The house had several floors of rather dirty，empty rooms with very little furniture. Mrs Micawber was a thin，tired-looking woman with a baby in her arms. The baby was one of twins，and in all my experience of the family, I never saw Mrs Micawber without at least one of the twins. They also had a four-year-old son and a three-year-old daughter. Their only servant was a young orphan girl.</p>
<p>米考伯先生一家显然穷困潦倒，但他们尽量掩饰这一点。房子分为数层，有几间肮脏不堪的空房间，没什么家具。米考伯太太是个消瘦、一脸倦容的女人，怀里抱着婴儿，婴儿是双胞胎中的一个。我和这个家相处的经历中从未见到米考伯太太没抱孩子的时候。他们还有一个4岁的男孩和一个3岁的女孩。他们唯一的保姆是一个小孤儿。</p>
<p>‘ I never thought， ’Mrs Micawber told me sadly as she showed me my room，‘ when I lived with Mother and Father, before I was married，that I would ever be as poor as this. But as Mr Micawber is for the moment in difficulties，I must of course accept the situation. I'm afraid he owes a lot of money，but his creditors will just have to wait！ You can't get blood out of a stone， nor can anyone get any money at all out of Mr Micawber at present！’</p>
<p>“我从未想到，”米考伯太太带我看房间的时候伤心地说，“我结婚前和父母住在一起的时候，我从未想到我会穷到这个地步，但是，如今米考伯先生正处于困难时期，我当然必须接受这种现状。恐怕他是欠了很多钱，但他的债主得等一等。石头里是挤不出血来的，同样，目前任何人都不能从米考伯先生那儿逼出一分钱。”</p>
<p>I soon realized that neither Mr nor Mrs Micawger had ever been able to manage money.The little that Mr Micawber earned was not enough， either to keep his creditors happy, or to pay for the needs of his growing family. So his creditors were constantly at the door， demanding payment, and meals were rather irregular in the Micawber house. Mr and Mrs Micawber's moods varied according to the situation. One moment Mr Micawber looked extremely miserable and depressed，the next he was brushing his shoes and singing a song before going out. Mrs Micawber's character was similar to her hus band's. Sometimes I came home to find her lying on the floor，with her hair undone， looking wild and desperate, but an hour later she was cheerfully eating a good supper.</p>
<p>我很快意识到无论是米考伯先生还是米考伯太太都没法弄到钱。米考伯先生仅有的一点收入远远不够，既不能让他的债主放心，也不能承担他那日见膨胀的家庭支出。所以，他的债主们就常常出现在他的家门口索取债务，而米考伯先生家中却常常是上顿不接下顿。米考伯夫妇的情绪会随境况的改变而改变。忽儿，米考伯先生看上去极其痛苦、消沉，忽儿，他又会边擦皮鞋边哼哼小曲儿准备外出。米考伯太太的性格很像她丈夫。有时，我走进家里见她躺在地上，头发蓬乱，表情疯狂而绝望。但一小时后，她就会兴高采烈地享受一顿丰盛的晚餐。</p>
<p>I lived with these kind people for several months， and became very fond of them. I bought my own food out of my wages，because I knew the Micawbers hardly ever had enough for themselves，and I lived mostly on bread and cheese. As they were so short of money， once or twice I offered to lend them a few shillings，which they refused to accept.But at last Mr Micawber's creditors became tired of waiting for their money，and went to the police, who arrested him for debt. He was taken to the King's Prison， and asked me to visit him there. When I arrived，I was shown to his room, where he was waiting for me. He seemed quite brokenhearted， and even cried a little.</p>
<p>我和这些友善的人住了几个月就开始喜欢他们了。我用自己的工资买食物，因为我知道米考伯一家很难够自己吃的，而我的食物大致上也只是面包和奶酪。由于他们如此缺钱，有那么一两次我主动提出借他们几先令，但被他们拒绝了。然而，米考伯先生的债主们最终没有耐心再等待下去，就找来警察，以拖欠债务之名拘捕了米考伯先生。他被送往王家监狱，他要求我去那儿看他。我一到那儿就被带到他的房间，他早已在那里等我。他似乎痛心疾首，甚至还伤心落泪。</p>
<p>‘This is a black day for me，Copperfield！’ he sobbed.‘I hope my mistakes will be a warning to young people like you！Remember，if a man earns twenty pounds a year, and spends nineteen pounds and nineteen shillings， the result is happiness. But if he spends twenty pounds and one shilling，the result is misery！ By the way， Copperfield，could you lend me a shilling for some beer？ Mrs Micawber will pay you back as soon as you arrive home. ’ And when the beer arrived， he appeared much more cheerful. We had a pleasant evening，telling stories and jokes.</p>
<p>“这是我倒楣的日子，科波菲尔！”他抽泣道，“希望我的错误能给像你这样的年轻人一个警示！记住，如果一个人一年收入20英镑，花费19英镑19先令，结局是幸福，但假如他花费20英镑零1先令，结果就是痛苦！顺便问一下，科波菲尔，你能借我1先令买点啤酒吗？回家米考伯太太会还给你的。”啤酒买回来后，他似乎高兴了许多。我们俩愉快地过了一晚上，不停地讲故事，说笑话。</p>
<p>He stayed in prison for several weeks， and I visited him regularly．I was delighted to hear on one of my visits that he would soon be free， as his creditors had unwillingly accepted the fact that he had no way of paying his debts. I gave the news to Mrs Micawber when I returned home. We celebrated by sharing our supper and a glass of wine together.</p>
<p>他在监狱里关了几个星期，其间我时常去探望他。有一次他告诉我他将很快被释放，因为他的债主们最终很不情愿地接受了米考伯先生无法偿债的事实，我真替他高兴。我回家时把这一消息告诉了米考伯太太，我们一起吃晚餐并开了一瓶酒以示庆祝。</p>
<p>‘May I ask what you will do， madam, when Mr Micawber is free？’I asked politely.</p>
<p>“我想问问，夫人，米考伯先生获释后你们打算干什么？”我很礼貌地问了一句。</p>
<p>‘My family，’ said Mrs Micawber grandly, ‘believe that Mr Micawber should move to the country， to Devon, and carry on his business interests there. Mr Micawber is a very clever man， Master Copperfield.’</p>
<p>“我娘家人，”米考伯太太自豪地说道，“认为米考伯先生应该离开这儿去德文，去那儿展示他的经商兴趣。米考伯先生是个聪明人，科波菲尔少爷。”</p>
<p>‘I'm sure he is，’ I agreed.</p>
<p>“我相信他是，”我表示同意。</p>
<p>‘Although they haven't found anything exactly right for him yet，my family think he should be ready, in Devon, in case something turns up.’She put down her empty glass.</p>
<p>“尽管我娘家人还没有给他找到具体的事做，他们认为他应该去德文时刻准备着，等待机遇的降临。”她放下空酒杯。</p>
<p>‘And will you be going with him， madam？’ I asked.</p>
<p>“您跟他一起走吗，夫人？”我问。</p>
<p>‘I must！I will！’Mrs Micawber's voice rose to a scream.‘He is my life！ My love！My husband！ The father of my children！ I will never desert Mr Micawber！ You can't ask me to desert him！’</p>
<p>“我必须去！我一定去！”米考伯太太的声音高得都要尖叫起来，“他是我的生命！我的爱！我的丈夫！孩子们的父亲！我不能抛弃米考伯先生！要我那么做绝对不成！”</p>
<p>I felt very uncomfortable，as I had not asked her to desert him at all， but she soon became calm again and finished her supper.I was becoming used to the Micawbers’ changes of mood.</p>
<p>我觉得很尴尬，因为我压根儿就没让她抛弃他，但她很快又平静下来，吃完了她的晚餐。我开始习惯米考伯夫妇的情绪的大起大落了。</p>
<p>I now realized that when the Micawbers left London， as they were planning to do， I would be very lonely in the city. I still hated my work in the warehouse， and wanted to make a better life for myself.I thought about it for a long time， and decided there was only one thing I could do. I would try to find my one surviving relation，my father's aunt, Miss Betsey Trotwood， and ask her to help me. I knew she lived somewhere near Dover，in Kent.I could go there by coach, be-cause Peggotty had once sent me ten shillings to keep，in case I ever needed it.The time had come to use that money.</p>
<p>米考伯夫妇按预定计划离开伦敦的同时，我才意识到我在这个城市中将会孤身一人。我仍然讨厌仓库的工作，总想让自己生活得好一些。为此我考虑了很久，终于决定走唯一的一条路。我要去找我唯一活着的亲人，我父亲的姨妈贝茜&middot;特拉伍德小姐，并争取她的帮助。我知道她住在肯特郡的多佛镇附近。我可以坐马车去，因为辟果提给过我10先令，她让我留着以备急需之用。现在是用这笔钱的时候了。</p><a href='4.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
