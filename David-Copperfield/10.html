<p><b>10 死亡与发现 </b></p>
<p>Traddles and I had both received rather strange letters from Mr Micawber， in which he asked us to come to Canterbury， with my aunt． At this meeting， he said， he would show to all of us the proof of Uriah Heep's wickedness．Dora was too ill to come with us， so Traddles， my aunt， Mr Dick and I travelled to Canterbury by coach， spent the night in a hotel there，and arrived punctually at the Wickfields’house the next morning． Mr Micawber met us at the door and showed us into Uriah Heep's office． Uriah himself seemed rather surprised to see us， but pretended to welcome us as old friends． Mr Micawber brought Agnes into the room too， and then stood firmly by the door．</p>
<p>特拉德和我都接到米考伯先生写来的奇怪的信，他要我俩和我姨婆去一趟坎特伯雷城。这次会面，他说，他要让我们看看尤赖亚&middot;希普的恶劣行径的罪证。朵拉身体太弱不能和我们一起去，所以，特拉德、姨婆、迪克先生和我搭上长途马车，来到了坎特伯雷，在当地的旅馆住了一宿，第二天早上很准时地来到威克菲尔住所。米考伯先生在门口迎接我们并把我们带到了尤赖亚&middot;希普的办公室。尤赖亚本人见到我们似乎很吃惊，但装着迎接老朋友似地欢迎了我们。米考伯先生把阿格尼斯也带到了办公室，自己则坚定地站在门口。</p>
<p>‘Don't wait， Micawber，’ said Uriah to his assistant．</p>
<p>“出去，米考伯，”尤赖亚对他的助手说道。</p>
<p>But Mr Micawber did not move．He stared coldly at his employer.</p>
<p>可米考伯先生没走，他冷冷地盯着他的雇主。</p>
<p>‘ Did you hear what I said， Micawber？’ said Uriah angrily，his little eyes becoming redder while his long face went very pale．</p>
<p>“你听见我的话了吗，米考伯？”尤赖亚生气地说道，他的小眼睛越来越红，他的长脸开始苍白。</p>
<p>‘ Yes！’ replied Micawber．‘ But I don't choose to leave．Listen to me， Heep！ I don't care if I lose my job！I don't wish to work any longer for the wickedest man in England！’</p>
<p>“听见了，”米考伯回答，“可我不准备离开。听着，希普！我不在乎丢掉饭碗！我不想再为英国最恶毒的人卖命？”</p>
<p>Uriah fell back， shocked． Looking slowly round at us， with a dark， evil expression on his face， he said，‘ I see！You've all arranged this between you！ But I know who to blame for this！It's you，Copperfield！ You're jealous of my new position ，aren't you？But I know things about all of you which I can use against you—for example，I know about your father's business mistakes， Miss Agnes， and I know about your past in the warehouse，Copperfield！So be careful，I warn you all！’</p>
<p>尤赖亚大惊失色倒退一步，之后，他慢慢地环视着我们，带着一种阴暗、邪恶的表情说道：“我明白了！你们几个都串通好了！可我知道谁该受谴责！是你，科波菲尔！你嫉妒我的新职位，是不是？可我知道可以用来对付你们的所有事情——比方说，我知道你父亲生意上的失误，阿格尼斯小姐；我知道你在仓库的一段过去，科波菲尔！所以，小心点，我警告你们！”</p>
<p>‘Mr Micawber，’ I said calmly，‘please tell us what you were going to say about this man！’</p>
<p>“米考伯先生，”我平静地说，“请你告诉我们关于这个人你要说些什么！”</p>
<p>Just then Traddles， who had disappeared a few minutes before，reappeared with Mrs Heep．Uriah had not noticed Traddles before．‘ Who are you？’ he demanded angrily．</p>
<p>正在这个时候，几分钟之前离开了房间的特拉德尔带着希普太太重新出现了。尤赖亚在此之前没注意到特拉德尔。“你是谁？”他愤愤地问道。</p>
<p>‘ I am a lawyer and a friend of Mr Wickfield， sir，’ said Traddles， in a businesslike way．‘ And he's asked me to carry out all his business arrangements from now on．’This came as a surprise to me as well as to Uriah．</p>
<p>“我是一名律师，威克菲尔先生的朋友，先生，”特拉德尔说道，俨然一副公事公办的样子，“他要求我从现在起处理他的一切业务往来。”这话出乎我的意料，尤赖亚也始料不及。</p>
<p>‘The old fool has been drinking too much again！’ said Uriah，looking uglier than ever．‘ You can't believe anything he says！And you've bribed my assistant，I suppose，to speak against me！’</p>
<p>“这个老浑蛋又喝多了！”尤赖亚说，显得比以前更丑陋。“你们不要相信他说的任何一句话！我料想你是贿赂了我的助手，让他反对我！”</p>
<p>‘ It's you who have been dishonest，’ said Traddles firmly，‘as we shall hear from Mr Micawber．’And we all looked expectantly towards that large， important-looking gentleman．He was clearly delighted to have such an interested audience，and cleared his throat several times before starting to speak．As he spoke， his voice became louder and louder with excitement， until he was almost shouting．</p>
<p>“不诚实的是你，”特拉德尔坚定地说道，“米考伯先生会讲给我们听。”我们都迫不及待地看着这位宽脸庞、大人物长相的先生。他显然很高兴拥有如此专注的听众，在开始说话之前清了好几下嗓子。说的时候，他的声音因激动而越来越大，直至几乎成了高喊。</p>
<p>‘ Ladies and gentlemen，’he began，‘ when very poor and desperate for work， I came to Canterbury as assistant to this evil man Heep．I am sorry to say I was soon involved in all his wicked plans．I may be poor， but I can't accept his lies， his cheating， his bribes and all the rest of it． And so I've brought you here today， ladies and gentlemen， to hear me accuse Heep publicly！ One， he has confused and lied to his partner so often that poor Mr Wickfield now thinks he has himself been dishonest．Two， he has sometimes copied Mr Wickfield's signature on to false documents and cheques． Three， for years he has been stealing large amounts of money from Mr Wickfield and the firm！’</p>
<p>“女士们，先生们，”他开始道，“由于贫穷，极需工作，我来到坎特伯雷城担任这个恶魔希普的助手。我很抱歉，我很快卷入了他全部的罪恶计划。我虽贫穷，可我不能忍受他的谎言、他的欺诈行为、他的贿赂和其他种种劣行。所以我今天把你们叫来。女士们，先生们，倾听我对希普的公开控诉！第一，他经常扰乱、迷惑他的合伙人，以至可怜的威克菲尔先生误以为是他自己不诚实。第二，他有时仿造威克菲尔的签字签写文件和支票。第三，几年来他一直盗用威克菲尔先生和事务所的大量现金！”</p>
<p>‘ You can never prove it！’ cried Uriah wildly．</p>
<p>“你证明不了这一切！”尤赖亚疯狂地叫道。</p>
<p>‘ I have taken copies of all the necessary documents，’said Mr Micawber confidently，‘ while working as your clerk． And just to make sure， I've given them to Mr Traddles to keep safely．’</p>
<p>“我保留了所有重要文件的副本，”米考伯先生自信地说，“在作为你的职员而工作的时候。为确凿起见，我已把它们交由特拉德先生妥善保管。”</p>
<p>‘ Uriah，my dear boy，’cried his mother，sobbing bitterly，‘ tell them how humble you are！Say you didn't mean to hurt anyone！ Say you're sorry，and arrange matters with these gentlemen！Do，dear boy！’</p>
<p>“尤赖亚，我亲爱的孩子，”他母亲痛哭道，“告诉他们你是多么卑谦恭顺！说你无意伤害任何人！说你很抱歉，愿意和先生们协调这些事！说，亲爱的孩子！”</p>
<p>‘ Mother， be quiet！’he whispered angrily．‘ Don't help my enemies！Copperfield here would have given you a hundred pounds to say what you've just said！’</p>
<p>“母亲，安静点！”他愤愤地低声说道，“不要帮助我的敌人们！科波菲尔情愿出价100英镑买你刚才一番话！”</p>
<p>Suddenly my aunt attacked Uriah， hitting his head with her umbrella．‘ Give me back my investments！’ she cried．‘ I thought Mr Wickfield had lost my money， and I didn't want to hurt Agnes by saying so！ But now I know you've had control of the firm，and you've stolen my money…’Somehow I managed to get her away from him before she hurt him too badly．</p>
<p>突然，我姨婆对尤赖亚发起进攻，她用伞打他的脑袋，“把我的投资还给我！”她叫道，“我以为是威克菲尔先生把钱弄丢了，我没这么说是不想伤害阿格尼斯！而现在我知道是你控制了事务所，是你偷了我的钱……”在她没来得及痛揍他之前，我设法把她拉开了。</p>
<p>Then Mrs Heep fell on her knees to all of us， begging us to forgive her dear boy， and to remember how humble he always was．</p>
<p>这时，希普太太给我们大家跪下了，乞求我们饶恕他亲爱的孩子并想想他以前一惯的卑微相。</p>
<p>‘ Be silent，Mother！’ said her son． He turned to Traddles and asked unpleasantly，‘ Well？ What are you asking me to do？’</p>
<p>“安静，母亲！”她儿子说。他转向特拉德，令人不悦地问道，“怎样？你让我做什么？”</p>
<p>‘ Not asking， demanding， Heep． You will give us the keys to all your boxes and drawers， all your documents and cheque-books， everything in fact that belongs to the firm． You will stay in this house until we've checked all the documents．’</p>
<p>“不是让你，而是命令你，希普。你把你所有箱子、抽屉的钥匙，所有的文件、支票簿、以及所有属于事务所的东西都交出来。你必须留在这所房子里直到我们核对完所有的文件。”</p>
<p>‘ And if I don't agree？’ he asked， frowning．</p>
<p>“要是我不同意呢？”他皱了皱眉，问道。</p>
<p>‘ Copperfield， perhaps you would fetch a couple of policemen． Things move slowly in the lawcourts， but in the end Mr Wickfield will get his business back， and you， Heep，will be in prison for a very long time．’</p>
<p>“科波菲尔，或许你该去叫几个警察来。通过法庭事情处理起来要慢些，但最终威克菲尔先生会要回他的事务所，而你，希普，将要在牢里呆上很长一段。”</p>
<p>Uriah realized that he had to do what we wanted， and went to fetch the documents， with Mr Dick at his side． At the door， with his blackest， most evil expression， Heep turned and said to me，‘ I've always hated you，Copperfield！’ Then he was taken away．</p>
<p>尤赖亚意识到他必须按我们的要求去做，于是就去取文件，迪克先生跟在他身边。走到门口，希普转过身，带着最阴暗、最邪恶的表情跟我说道：“我早就恨你，科波菲尔！”然后他被带走了。</p>
<p>In the next few days Traddles and Micawber worked very hard together to put right what Uriah had done．They discovered my aunt's money and gave it back to her， and paid all the firm's debts．Mr Wickfield decided to sell his business， and retire． The Wickfields would not have much money， but at least they did not owe anything． In the end Uriah Heep and his mother left Canterbury， but we all thought he was too evil to stay out of trouble for long．</p>
<p>接下来的几天，特拉德尔和米考伯一起辛苦工作，把尤赖亚所干一切更正过来。他们发现了我姨婆的那笔钱，并把钱退给了她，还付清了公司的所有债务。威克菲尔先生决定卖掉公司，然后退休。威克菲尔父女将剩不下多少钱，但至少他们不欠下什么。最后，尤赖亚&middot;希普和他母亲离开了坎特伯雷，可我们都认为他那么恶毒，不惹祸的日子长不了。</p>
<p>My aunt had a wonderful idea for the Micawber family．‘Have you ever thought of going to live in Australia？’ she suggested．‘ It's a new country， with a lot of business opportunities．’</p>
<p>姨婆给米考伯一家出了一个极妙的主意。“你们想过移居澳大利亚吗？”她建议道，“那是个新国家，多的是做生意的机会。”</p>
<p>Mr Micawber was very interested．‘ Something could easily turn up there，’ he agreed． My aunt generously offered to lend him the necessary money to pay for the journey， and the whole Micawber family started planning and packing immediately．</p>
<p>米考伯先生很感兴趣，“那儿很容易出现转机，”他赞同地说。姨婆很慷慨地提出借他一路所需的费用，于是米考伯一家上下很快就开始准备，收拾行装。</p>
<p>When I returned to London， I realized my poor Dora was much worse． She stayed upstairs all the time now， and the sitting-room seemed very quiet without my little child-wife in her usual place．One day when I was sitting with her in her room，she said lovingly，‘You know， David dear， I'm afraid I was too young.’</p>
<p>我回到伦敦，意识到可怜的朵拉病得更厉害了。她现在一直呆在楼上，客厅里没有我的小童妻在她以往的位置上似乎非常安静。一天，我在她房间坐在她身边，她动情地说，“你知道，大卫，亲爱的，恐怕我太年轻了。”</p>
<p>‘ Don't say that，Dora！’I whispered，conscious that she was speaking of herself in the past．</p>
<p>“别这么说，朵拉！”我轻声说道，感觉她在说自己的过去。</p>
<p>‘I was a silly little girl， David， and you know it． It's just as well that I won't live much longer．Perhaps if I lived，you'd wish you'd married someone more sensible， more practical，someone like…’ She did not finish what she was saying．</p>
<p>“我是一个傻小孩，大卫，你是知道的。我活不长了正好。或许要是我活下去，你会希望自己应该娶一位更懂事理，更现实的人，就像…”她没有接下去说完。</p>
<p>‘ But we've been so happy， Dora！’I said，trying not to cry.</p>
<p>“但我们一直那么快乐，朵拉！”我说，竭力不让自己哭出来。</p>
<p>She took my band and kissed it．‘We have， haven't we？David， do you think if you asked Agnes， she'd come and see me？ I have something particular to say to her．’</p>
<p>她握住我的手，吻了吻。“我们是快乐，不是吗？大卫，你觉得假如你要阿格尼斯来一趟，她会来看我吗？我有特别的事要跟她说。”</p>
<p>‘Of course， my love， I'll write to her tonight．’</p>
<p>“当然，我的宝贝，我今晚就给她写信。”</p>
<p>Agnes came the next day， and went straight upstairs to see Dora．Although the doctor and my aunt had told me there was no hope that Dora would live， when I held her hand and saw her love for me in her innocent blue eyes，I could not believe she would be taken from me．But when Agnes came downstairs so calmly and silently， and said nothing，but raised her hand and pointed upwards，I knew！It was over，and I remembered only darkness for a long time afterwards．</p>
<p>第二天，阿格尼斯来了，径直来到楼上看望朵拉。尽管医生和姨婆都告诉过我朵拉活下来的希望很渺茫，当我握着她的手，从她天真无邪的蓝眼睛里看出她对我的爱时，我还是不相信她会离我而去。但当阿格尼斯平静、悄然地下楼来，一句话不说，只是抬手指了指楼上时，我明白了！一切都结束了，此后很长一段时间我的记忆里只有一片黑暗。</p>
<p>In the middle of my terrible sadness I received a message from Emily．She asked me to take a letter from her to Ham her last words to the man who had loved her so much——before she and Daniel left England for Australia． They were sailing in two weeks’ time， and the Micawbers were going on the same ship. I remembered my childish love for little Emily， and agreed to do what she asked．</p>
<p>正当我处在万分悲痛之中，我收到了埃米莉的便条，她要我在她和丹尼尔离开英国前往澳大利亚之前给哈姆去送一封信——她对这位曾经是那么爱她的人所说的最后的话。他们两周后起航，米考伯一家在同一艘轮船上。我回想起对小埃米莉那孩童般的爱，就同意了她的要求。</p>
<p>The weather was very stormy as I travelled through the night to Yarmouth．Several times the coach was almost knocked off the road by the wind and the rain． By the time we arrived in Yarmouth， most of the local people were in the streets， afraid to stay in their houses， in case the roof or the chimney blew down． Many women were crying， afraid for their husbands or brothers who were out fishing in their small boats． The sea itself， with its huge waves crashing noisily on the beach， frightened us all very much．</p>
<p>我去往雅茅斯的那晚是一个暴风雨天气。有几次，风和雨差点把马车掀到路下。我们到达雅茅斯时，大多数当地的人都跑到街上，他们害怕呆在家里，怕房顶或烟囱会被风刮倒。许多妇女都在哭泣，担心驾着小船出海的丈夫们或兄弟们。而大海呢，巨浪呼啸着拍打海岸，没有人不害怕。</p>
<p>I went to the hotel， and tried to sleep a little after my tiring journey． But the wind made so much noise that I could not sleep， and I went down to the beach again， where a lot of people were standing together， watching the waves． By now the storm had got even worse．</p>
<p>我来到旅馆，准备睡一会，消消旅途的劳累。可风声如此狂虐，让我无法入睡，于是我又来到海岸边，那里聚集了很多人，注视着海浪。此时暴风雨更猛烈了。</p>
<p>‘ Two ships have gone down， sir！’ a local fisherman shouted to me．‘ A few miles away！ We couldn't save any of the men on them！ The waves were too high！ And look！ There's another！’</p>
<p>“已经沉了两艘船了，先生！”当地一位渔民对我喊道，“就在几里开外！我们无法营救船上的人！浪太高了！瞧，又有一艘船！”</p>
<p>And suddenly I gasped in horror． I could see a great ship，which had been pushed violently on to the rocks by the waves．It was in danger of falling back into the waves， or of breaking in half， at any moment. Several figures were visible on the ship ， especially one very active， curly-haired young man， who seemed to be giving orders． The crowd on the beach cried out as the ship rolled and a huge wave swept over it， carrying the men into the rushing water．In a moment the only figure we could see was the curly-haired young man， holding desperately on to the side of the ship and calling for help． What could we do ？ It was certain death for any man to enter those waves．</p>
<p>突然，我惊恐地倒吸一口凉气。我看见一艘巨轮被海浪无情地搁在了礁石上。随时都有可能被冲回浪里，或折成两半的危险。船上有几个人影依晰可见，尤其是一位非常活跃的、卷头发的青年，看上去像是在指挥。当轮船摇晃了几下，一个巨浪横扫过去，把船上的人卷入激流时，岸上的人群发出一阵叫喊。这时，我们唯一能看见的只剩那位卷头发的青年人了，他拼命地抓着船沿呼救。我们能做什么？任何人进入这海浪中都必死无疑。</p>
<p>Just then I saw Ham Peggotty running through the crowd to the edge of tM water． One end of a rope was tied around his waist， and the other end was held firmly be three strong men standing on the beach．</p>
<p>正在这时，我看见哈姆&middot;辟果提冲出人群，跑向海边。一条绳子的一端系在他的腰上，另一端由站在岸上的三个壮小伙子紧紧地拉着。</p>
<p>‘ No， Ham！’I cried，trying to hold him back．‘ Don't try to rescue that poor sailor！You'll kill yourself！’</p>
<p>“别，哈姆！”我叫道，试图拉回他，“不用试着去救那可怜的水手！你自己会没命的！”</p>
<p>‘ Let me go，Master David！’he replied cheerfully，shaking both my hands．‘ If God thinks it’ s time for me to die， then I'm ready！ Friends，I'm going in！Give me more rope！’</p>
<p>“让我去，大卫少爷！”他握住我的两个手，心甘情愿地回答，“如果上帝认为现在是我的死期，那么我已经准备就绪！伙计们，我要下去了！放绳！”</p>
<p>He dived in under a great wave， and swam strongly towards the ship． In another moment he would have reached it， when a high green hill of water appeared，and the ship went down with a great crash．The people on the beach pulled on Ham's rope， and he arrived at my feet—dead． They carried him to the nearest house， and I called a doctor， but nothing could be done for him．He had been beaten to death by that great wave， and his generous heart had stopped for ever．</p>
<p>他潜入到一个巨浪底下，很有力地朝轮船游去。再有一会儿，他就要触到轮船了，这时，一个巨大得像山一样的绿色海浪迎面袭来，轮船被打得粉碎沉了下去。岸上的人们收回哈姆的绳索，他来到我的脚边——死了。他们把他扛到距离最近的一所房子，我叫来了医生，但已无济于事。他被那一阵巨浪打死了，他的博大的心脏停止了跳动。</p>
<p>As I sat hopelessly by his bed， a fisherman who had known me when Emily and I were children， came to tell me he recognized the curly-haired sailor， whose body had been thrown out of the water by the waves． I went to see． And there on the beach where she and I had played， I saw Steerforth lying，with his handsome face on his arm． He would never smile at me or Emily again．</p>
<p>我心灰意冷地坐在他床边，一位在我和埃米莉还小的时候就认识我的渔夫进来告诉我他认出了那位卷头发的水手，他的尸体被海浪冲上了海滩。我过去一看，在埃米莉和我过去常玩的海滩上，斯提福兹躺在那儿，胳膊枕在他那英俊的脸下面。他再也不会对我或埃米莉笑了。</p>
<p>I was surrounded by too many ghosts to return to London and my old life． I was selfishly sad that I had lost my child-wife and my childhood friend，and sometimes I felt I wanted to die．So I left England， and travelled for many months in Europe． I lived in a dark， miserable dream， with no hope or interest in my future．</p>
<p>我被太多的幽灵包围着，我不能再回伦敦，回到我的旧生活。我只顾悲痛失去了我的童妻，失去了儿时的朋友，有时我觉得自己都想死。所以我离开了英国，到欧洲游历了数月。我生活在黑暗、痛苦的梦境中，对未来毫无希望和兴趣。</p>
<p>One evening I arrived in a village in Switzerland， and received a packet of letters that had been waiting for me．</p>
<p>一天晚上，我到达瑞士的一个小村落，收到了早已等在那儿的一捆信。</p>
<p>The first one I opened was from Agnes．She gave me no advice，but she told me simply that she trusted me to find a purpose in life，and that she would always be proud of me， and love me as a sister．</p>
<p>我首先拆开的是阿格尼斯的信，她没给我任何建议，只简单地告诉我，她相信我能寻找到生活的目标，她将永远为我骄傲，并且像姐姐一样爱我。</p>
<p>As the light died out of the sky，and I watched the colour of the snow on the mountain tops change， I felt I was waking from my unhappy dream， and I began to understand how much I loved Agnes．She had been the one who had always guided and supported me， and now I realized I needed her love for the rest of my life． Had falling in love with Dora been a mistake？We had both been very young， it is true． I had always called Agnes sister， and now perhaps I no longer had the right to ask whether her love for me was more than sisterly．</p>
<p>天空的夜色逐渐消退，我注视着山顶上的雪慢慢转变颜色，感觉自己正从不愉快的梦境中醒来，我开始明白自己是那么地爱阿格尼斯。她才是一直引导我、支持我的人，现在我意识到我的余生需要她的爱。爱上朵拉是个错误吗？我们俩都很年轻，这是事实。我一直把阿格尼斯称做姐姐，或许现在我已没资格问她对我的爱是否能超越姐弟般的爱。</p>
<p>However， I decided to return， and travelled home to England， after three years of absence．I was delighted to find that Traddles had married his Sophy， and was doing well as a lawyer． My aunt had moved back to her old Dover house， and was living happily there with Mr Dick and Peggotty． When I visited my aunt， I took the opportunity of asking her about Agnes.</p>
<p>不管怎样，在阔别三年之后，我决定回去，回到英国的家。我欣喜地发现，特拉德已经和他的索菲结婚，还干律师，干得不错。姨婆已搬回到多佛她的老房子里，和迪克先生和辟果提愉快地生活在一起。我去看望我姨婆时，趁机打听了一下阿格尼斯的情况。</p>
<p>‘Has she—has she any young man she'd like to marry？’ I asked as lightly as possible．</p>
<p>“她有——她有意中人了吗？”我尽可能轻松地问道。</p>
<p>My aunt looked carefully at me as she replied，‘ I suspect she has， David． She's never mentioned it to me， but I think—I feel sure she's going to marry soon．’</p>
<p>姨婆仔细地打量着我回答：“我估计她有，大卫。她从未跟我提起过，可我认为——我肯定她很快就要结婚了。”</p>
<p>I was firm with myself and did not show my feelings． I borrowed a horse and rode to Canterbury to ask Agnes myself．When I saw that beautiful， gentle face again， I knew I had come home． I knew how dear she was to me， and would always be．</p>
<p>我稳住自己不流露任何情绪。我借了一匹马，骑到坎特伯雷当面去问阿格尼斯。当我再一次看着她美丽、温柔的脸时，我感觉自己回到了家。我知道她对我有多亲，而且永远那么亲。</p>
<p>‘ Agnes，’I said，‘ I am so grateful to you， for making me what I am ， for helping me to be good！ But I think you have a secret． Let me share it， Agnes， as your brother！ Tell me whom you love！’</p>
<p>“阿格尼斯，”我说，“我是那么感激你，感谢你造就如今的我，感谢你帮助我走上正路！可我觉得你有事瞒着我，说给我听听，说给你的弟弟听，阿格尼斯！告诉我你爱的是谁！”</p>
<p>Agnes turned away from me and burst into tears． Somehow these tears did not sadden me， but gave me hope．‘ My dear Agnes！Don't cry！’</p>
<p>阿格尼斯转过身去，痛哭起来。可不知怎么地，她的眼泪并不令我忧伤，反而给了我希望。“我亲爱的阿格尼斯！别哭了！”</p>
<p>‘David， leave me！ I can't talk about it now！’ she sobbed．</p>
<p>“大卫，别管我！我现在没法说！”她抽泣道。</p>
<p>‘ Agnes， you're dearer to me than anything in the world．Don't think I'll be jealous of any man you choose to marry． I only want you to be happy！’</p>
<p>“阿格尼斯，在这个世界上，你对我比任何人都亲。别以为我会嫉妒你选择要嫁的男人，我只想让你快乐！”</p>
<p>She had stopped crying now and was calmer．‘ If I have a secret， David， it is—not a new one． It has been my secret—for a long time！’</p>
<p>她这时停止了哭泣，平静多了。“要是我有什么秘密，大卫，那也是——不是什么新的。那一直是我的秘密——保留了很长时间。”</p>
<p>I was wild with hope．‘ Not a new one’！ Did she mean…？‘Dearest Agnes！ Dare I hope to call you more than a sister！’She was in my arms and sobbing again， but this time with happiness.‘ I went away， Agnes， loving you！I returned home， loving you！’</p>
<p>我欣喜若狂，“不是新的”！难道她指的是……？“最亲爱的阿格尼斯！我能叫你比姐姐更亲的称呼吗！”她投进我的怀里，又一次哭起来，但这次是出于高兴。“我离开时，阿格尼斯！爱着你，我回到家时，爱着你！”</p>
<p>We held each other for some time， sure now of each other's love．</p>
<p>我们互相拥抱了一会儿，感受着对方对自己的爱。</p>
<p>‘ There is something I must tell you， David，’ she said gently，looking calmly into my face．‘I have loved you all my life！’ She added，‘ And something else—before our sweet Dora died， she asked me—can you guess—to fill the empty place in your heart．’ And Agnes laid her head on my shoulder， and cried． And I cried with her， although we were both so happy．</p>
<p>“有一件事我必须告诉你，大卫，”她温柔地说，并平静地看着我的脸，“我一辈子都在爱你！”她又说道，“还有一件事——我们亲爱的朵拉临死前，她要求我——你猜猜看——填补她在你心中的空缺。”阿格尼斯把头靠在我肩上哭起来，我也跟着哭了，尽管我们都感到幸福。</p>
<p>My story has almost come to an end． I have published several books now， and I am a well-known writer．Agnes and I have been married for twenty years， and live in perfect happiness，with our children around us． We have heard from Daniel Peggotty in Australia． He and Emily have made friends there and are happy．Mr Micawber has become an important figure in a large Australian town， and his family are quite used to living there． My aunt， Mr Dick and Peggotty are all white-haired and old now， but still very fit， and they love playing with our children whenever they can． My old friend Traddles has two sons of his own， and will soon become a judge．</p>
<p>我的故事将近尾声。我至今已出版了好几本书，成了一位著名的作家。阿格尼斯和我结婚已有20年，生活得幸福、美满，而且现已儿女成群。我们收到了远在澳洲的丹尼尔&middot;辟果提的消息，他和埃米莉在那儿广交朋友，生活得很快乐。米考伯先生在澳洲一个大集镇里成了一位重要人物。他一家很习惯那儿的生活。我姨婆、迪克先生和辟果提已成了白发苍苍的老人，但依然很健朗，他们只要一有时间就来陪我们的孩子们一起玩耍。我的老朋友特拉德尔已有两个儿子，自己很快将升为法官。</p>
<p>When I think of my friends and family， Agnes's lovely face shines above them all． She is here， next to me， as I write， and I hope that when my life comes to its end， she will be with me in the shadows， pointing upwards to the light！</p>
<p>当我想着我的朋友、家人时，阿格尼斯可爱的脸总闪耀在我眼前。现在，她就在我身边，陪伴我写作。我希望等我的人生之路走到尽头时，她能在黑暗中与我同在，为我指引光明！</p></body></html>
