<p><b>4 大卫和他的姨婆 </b></p>
<p>So，after helping the Micawbers to pack their few clothes，and waving goodbye to them at the coach sta-tion on their way to Devon，I went to the warehouse for my last day at work．I did not tell anyone I would not be coming back the following week. In the evening I packed my case，and put the ten shillings in the little purse Peggotty had once given me．I looked around for someone to help me with my case， which was rather heavy for me, and saw a tall young man with a horse and cart passing by．</p>
<p>就这样，帮着米考伯夫妇整理好不多的衣物，把他们送到去往德文的马车站，与他们挥手告别后，我来到仓库干完了最后一天的活。我没有向任何人透露下星期将不再回来工作。晚上，我整理好自己的提箱，把10先令放进辟果提给我的小钱包里。我四处张望，希望有人能帮我提这个对我来说还太沉的箱子，这时过来一位赶马车的高个子青年。</p>
<p>‘Could you please take my case to the coach station？’ I asked him politely．</p>
<p>“您能帮我把这个箱子带到马车站吗？”我很礼貌地问道。</p>
<p>The young man put the case into his cart. Then， looking round quickly to make sure there were no witnesses， he pushed me roughly against the wall and took my purse out of my trembling hand. Before I could say a word， he had driven the horse and cart down the road and out of sight round the corner.I knew I would never see him， my case or my ten shillings again．</p>
<p>那青年人把箱子放到马车上，然后环顾四周，确信周围没有外人时，就狠狠地把我推倒在墙边，并把钱包从我发抖的手中夺走。我还没来得及叫喊，他已经驾着马车上路，一拐弯就不见了。我知道我再也见不着他了，再也见不着我的钱包和我那10个先令了。</p>
<p>I sat down on the pavement and cried. Now I had lost ev－erything I owned in the world， and had no money for the coach fare to Dover．In the end I decided I would have to walk there， and I started the long journey. It took me six days to cover the hundred kilometres， as I got tired very easily, and had to rest．I sold my jacket for a shilling，so that I could buy bread and milk on the way，and at night I slept in disused farm buildings or under trees．Sometimes I was afraid of the dangerous－looking beggars and thieves I met on the road，but I knew I had to keep going．As I walked，I thought of my mother's gentle，pretty face．I felt sure she would approve of what I was doing，and that encouraged me to continue．</p>
<p>我站在路边哭泣。我失去了我所有的东西，而且也没有了去多佛的路费。最后我决定步行到那儿，就开始了长途跋涉。100多公里的路程我走了6天时间，因为我走不多久就累了，只好休息下来。我把茄克衫卖了，换来一先令钱买路上吃的面包和奶酪。到晚上，我就睡在废旧农场的木屋里或者大树下。有时在路上遇上一些满脸凶相的乞丐和小偷让我很害怕，但我知道我必须继续走下去。我边走边想象我母亲慈爱、动人的脸，我肯定她会支持我的做法，这种想法激励着我继续前进。</p>
<p>But when I arrived in Dover，it seemed a much larger town than I had imagined．I spent a whole morning asking people if they knew where Miss Betsey Trotwood lived．Finally I found someone who recognized the name and showed me the way to her house．I stood at her front door，in the neat little garden，for a few moments，trembling with fear，and wondering what my aunt would think of me．My face and hands were dirty，my hair was unbrushed，and my clothes were torn and dusty．Perhaps she wouldn't even want to invite me into her house！</p>
<p>然而，当我走到多佛时才知道这个小镇比我相象得要大得多。我整整花了一上午时间打听贝茜&middot;特拉伍德小姐的住处。最后，终于有一个人知道这个名字并指给我到她家的路。我在她门前的小花园里站了一会儿，害怕得直打哆嗦，不知道姨婆会怎么看我。我满脸污垢，两手肮脏不堪，头发蓬乱，衣眼又脏又破。或许她都不欢迎我进她的房子！</p>
<p>Just then a handsome but strict－looking grey－haired woman came out of the door towards me．I knew she must be my aunt．</p>
<p>正在此时，门口出现一位端庄、严肃的灰头发妇人，她向我走来，我想她肯定是我的姨婆。</p>
<p>‘Go away！'she said crossly．‘I don't allow anyone to walk on my grass！’</p>
<p>“走开！”她愤愤地说，“我不许任何人踩我的草地！”</p>
<p>‘Please，madam，’I said bravely，‘please，aunt…’</p>
<p>“求您，夫人，”我鼓足勇气说道，“求您，姨婆…”</p>
<p>‘WHAT？’cried Miss Betsey in great surprise．</p>
<p>“什么？”贝茜小姐十分震惊地叫道。</p>
<p>‘Please，aunt，I'm your nephew．’</p>
<p>“求您，姨婆，我是您的重外甥。”</p>
<p>‘Good heavens！’she cried，and sat down rather suddenly on the grass．</p>
<p>“天哪！”她叫了一声，忽地坐在了草地上。</p>
<p>‘I'm David Copper field，your nephew's son，of Blunder stone in Suffolk，where you came on the night I was born，and saw my dear mother．I've been very unhappy since she died．My stepfather sent me to work in London，and I hated it，and ran away，and someone stole my case and my money，and I've had to walk all the way，and I haven't slept in a bed for six nights！’Here my selfcontrol broke，and I fell to the ground，sobbing bitterly．</p>
<p>“我是大卫&middot;科波菲尔，您外甥的儿子，在萨福克郡的布兰德斯通。我出生的那天晚上您来过，并见了我亲爱的母亲。自从她去世后我非常不幸。继父把我送到伦敦干活，我恨死了，跑了出来，我的箱子和钱都被人偷走了，我只好一路步行到这儿，我6个晚上没有挨着床了！”说到这里，我再也抑制不住自己，倒在地上痛哭起来。</p>
<p>My aunt jumped to her feet，picked me up and took me into her sitting-room，where she mixed some medicine in a glass and made me drink it．She also wrapped me in a large blanket and put me on her sofa．Then she rang the bell for her servant，Janet．</p>
<p>姨婆迅速站起来，扶起我，把我带到客厅，并拿来一些药化在杯子里让我喝了。她用一块大毯子把我裹住，放在沙发上。然后摇了摇铃，招呼她的女仆詹妮特。</p>
<p>‘Please ask Mr Dick to come here，Janet，’she said．</p>
<p>“叫迪克先生到这里来，詹妮特，”她说。</p>
<p>A tall，grey－haired，pleasant－looking gentleman entered a few minutes later，laughing rather strangely to himself．</p>
<p>几分钟后，一位高个子、灰头发、面色和悦的先生十分古怪地笑着走进来。</p>
<p>‘Now，Mr Dick，’said my aunt firmly，‘don't be a fool，because we all know you're intelligent．’Mr Dick looked very serious at once．‘No doubt you remember that I had a nephew，David Copperfield？Well，this is his son．He has run away．’</p>
<p>“现在，迪克先生，”姨婆严肃地说，“别装傻了，因为我们都知道你很有天赋。”迪克先生很快认真起来。“你肯定记得我有过一个外甥，叫大卫&middot;科波菲尔。这位，就是他的儿子，他跑出来了。”</p>
<p>‘Oh，really？David's son！Run away！Well！’said Mr Dick．</p>
<p>“哦，是吗？大卫的儿子！跑出来了！噢？”迪克先生说。</p>
<p>‘Now the question is，Mr Dick，what shall I do with him？’</p>
<p>“现在的问题是，迪克先生，我应该怎么办才好？”</p>
<p>‘Well—’Mr Dick looked vacantly at me，and then sudden ly his eyes shone．‘If I were you，I would wash him！’</p>
<p>“嗯，——”迪克先生目光空洞地看着我，突然他两眼闪光，“我要是你，就先他给他洗洗澡！”</p>
<p>‘Well done，Mr Dick！You always have the right answer！’said my aunt delightedly．</p>
<p>“很好，迪克先生！你总会有正确的答案！”姨婆兴奋地说道。</p>
<p>And so they washed me，and gave me clean clothes and deli cious food．While I was eating，my aunt stared at me，occa sionally whispering‘Good heavens！’to herself．When she could see that I felt better，she asked me question after ques tion，and I told her the story of my life．</p>
<p>于是他们就为我洗澡，给我干净的衣服和美味的食物。我吃饭的时候，姨婆盯着我看，偶尔自叹一声“我的天！”。她见我感觉好些了就一个问题接一个问题地问我，我就把我的生活经历统统讲给她听。</p>
<p>‘Good heavens！’she said again，when I had finished．‘Why did your poor mother marry again？What a terrible mis take！’</p>
<p>“我的天！”我讲完后，她又说了一句，“你可怜的母亲为何要改嫁呢？她犯了个多大的错误呀！”</p>
<p>‘Perhaps she was in love，’suggested Mr Dick，smiling his rather foolish smile．</p>
<p>“或许是出于爱情，”迪克先生猜测道，嘴角挂着笨拙的笑容。</p>
<p>‘In love！’said Miss Betsey crossly．‘Perhaps the poor silly girl thought she was in love！But now，Mr Dick，another question．What should we do with the boy？’</p>
<p>“爱情！”贝茜小姐愤愤地说道，“或许是因为这位可怜的傻女孩自己认为谈上了恋爱！但是，现在，迪克先生，另一个问题是，我们拿这个孩子怎么办？”</p>
<p>‘Well—'said Mr Dick，thinking．Then an idea suddenly came to him．‘You should put him to bed！’</p>
<p>“嗯——”迪克先生思索着说道。然后，他突然想出了一个主意，“你应该带他上床睡觉！”</p>
<p>‘Thank you again，Mr Dick，for your common sense！’said my aunt happily．‘Janet，put the boy to bed！’</p>
<p>“再次感谢你，迪克先生，你真懂常理、知常情！”姨婆高兴地说道。</p>
<p>And so，in a comfortable clean little bed，in a pleasant airy room at the top of Miss Betsey Trotwood's house，I floated away into the world of my dreams．</p>
<p>就这样，在贝茜&middot;特拉伍德小姐的房子顶层，在安逸的卧室里，在一张干净而舒适的小床上，我进入了梦乡。</p>
<p>At breakfast next morning I bravely asked my aunt，‘Are you—have you—what's going to happen to me？’</p>
<p>第二天早餐时分，我鼓起勇气问姨婆：“您打算——您准备——我今后会怎么样？”</p>
<p>‘I've written to your stepfather，’she replied．</p>
<p>“我已经给你继父写了信。”她回答。</p>
<p>‘Oh！Are you going to send me back to the Murdstones？Please don't，aunt！Please let me stay here！’I cried，trembling．</p>
<p>“啊！那您准备把我送回给摩德斯通姐弟吗？求您别这样，姨婆！求您让我留在这里。”我哭起来，声音发颤。</p>
<p>‘I don't know what I'll do yet． We'll have to wait and see，’she answered firmly．</p>
<p>“我还不知道怎么办，我们必须等等看。”她严肃地说。</p>
<p>This news made me very depressed，but there was nothing I could do about it and my aunt soon began to talk about some thing else．</p>
<p>这一消息令我很沮丧，但我也毫无办法。姨婆立刻转入了别的话题。</p>
<p>‘What do you think of Mr Dick，child？’</p>
<p>“你认为迪克先生怎么样啊，孩子？”</p>
<p>‘He looks a little—well，mad．Is he mad，aunt？’</p>
<p>‘他有点儿——嗯，不正常。他是不太正常吧，姨婆？”</p>
<p>‘Well，his family called him mad，and wanted to lock him up for ever．But I met him，and thought—I still think—he's an extremely sensible，intelligent person．So I offered to take care of him，and he's lived in my house for ten years．Nobody knows what useful advice he's given me！I trust him com pletely！’</p>
<p>‘嗯，他的家人认为他不正常，想把他锁起来，但我看见他的时候我认为——我至今认为——他是一个非常敏感、聪慧的人，所以我主动提出照顾他。他在我这儿住了10年了，没人知道他给我提的建议多么有益，我完全信赖他。”</p>
<p>When I heard how generous my aunt had been to poor harmless Mr Dick，I began to understand her character better．In spite of her stern appearance and frequent crossness，she was very kind to people who needed her help．I hoped she would be kind to me．</p>
<p>听到姨婆对可怜无邪的迪克先生如此豁达时，我更了解她的性格了。尽管她看上去很严厉，而且常常满脸怒容，但她对需要帮助的人非常热心。我希望她对我也热心。</p>
<p>Several days later，I was looking out of the sitting－room window when I saw Mr and Miss Murdstone riding into my aunt's garden．My aunt had seen them too，and hurried out，waving her umbrella angrily at them and shouting．‘Go away！Don't ride on my grass！Who do you think you are？Go away，I tell you！’</p>
<p>几天后，透过客厅的窗户我看见摩德斯通先生和小姐骑马来到了姨婆的花园，姨婆也看见了他们，急匆匆地出去，挥着伞气愤地冲他们喊，“走开，别踩着我的草地，你们是什么人，走开，我警告你们！”</p>
<p>‘Aunt！’I cried out．‘They're Mr and Miss Murdstone！’</p>
<p>“姨婆！”我叫道，“他们是摩德斯通先生和小姐！”</p>
<p>‘I don't care！’she shouted．‘Nobody is allowed to ride on my grass！’And she went back into her house，banging the door behind her．The Murdstones had to lead their horses out of the garden，and then return to ring the doorbell．They looked very uncomfortable and unsure of themselves．Janet showed them into the sitting－room，where my aunt，Mr Dick and I were waiting．</p>
<p>“我才不管呢！”她嚷道“任何人都不允许践踏我的草地！”她走进屋子，“嘭”地一声关上门。摩德斯通姐弟只好把马牵出草地，退回去按门铃。他们似乎很尴尬、很不自信。詹妮特把他们带进了客厅。姨婆、迪克先生和我还等着他们。</p>
<p>‘Miss Trotwood—’began Mr Murdstone，stepping forward．</p>
<p>“特拉伍德小姐——”摩德斯通先生上前一步说道。</p>
<p>‘Excuse me，’said my aunt sharply．‘I imagine you are the Mr Murdstone who married my nephew's widow．In my opinion，it would have been much better if you had never mar ried the poor Child．’</p>
<p>“对不起，”姨婆尖锐地说，“我想你就是那位娶我外甥的遗孀作妻子的摩德斯通先生吧。依我看，你要是不娶那位可怜的女人，情况就会好多了！”</p>
<p>‘I agree with you，Miss Trotwood，’said Miss Murdstone，smiling falsely．‘My brother would certainly have been happi er if he hadn't married her，because I consider poor dear Clara was，in fact，just a child．’</p>
<p>“我同意您的说法，特拉伍德小姐，”摩德斯通小姐装出一副笑脸说道，“我弟弟当初要是没娶她当然会更幸福，因为我认为，可怜的克拉拉实际上只是个孩子。”</p>
<p>‘Fortunately，’said my aunt，‘you and I，madam，are too old and plain for anyone to say that about us．’</p>
<p>“幸运的是，”姨婆说，“你和我，女士，都太年老、太平庸，不值得任何人来说我们。”</p>
<p>Miss Murdstone did not seem eager to agree to this．Her brother，however，wanted to get down to business．</p>
<p>摩德斯通小姐对这点似乎不急于表示同意。而她弟弟则希望尽快转入正题。</p>
<p>‘Miss Trotwood，’he said，a little crossly，‘having received your letter，I've come to explain to you，in case you haven't realized it yet，that this boy is extremely wicked and violent．</p>
<p>“特拉伍德小姐，”他说道，显得有点生气，“收到您的信我就赶来向您解释，以免您还蒙在鼓里。</p>
<p>Both my sister and I have tried to change his character，but sadly we have failed．’</p>
<p>这孩子极为恶劣、粗暴，我姐姐和我坚持想改变他的性格，可遗憾的是，我们都失败了。”</p>
<p>‘I must add，’said Miss Murdstone，‘that of all the boys in the world，I believe this is the worst boy．’</p>
<p>“我必须补充一点，”摩德斯通小姐说道，“这世界上所有的孩子中，我相信他是最坏的一个。”</p>
<p>‘I see，’said my aunt．‘Now tell me，has David inherited any money from his father or mother？’</p>
<p>“我明白了，”我姨婆说，“好吧！现在告诉我，大卫从他父亲或母亲那儿继承到钱了吗？”</p>
<p>‘No，madam，’answered Mr Murdstone．‘My dear Clara naturally trusted me to take care of David，and I'm ready to do that，if he comes back with me now．But I alone shall de cide what to do with him，Miss Trotwood—understand that．I am here，for the first and last time，to take him away．If you decide to keep him with you，you keep him for ever．’</p>
<p>“没有，女士，”摩德斯通先生回答道，“我亲爱的克拉拉自然相信我能照顾好大卫，我也准备这么做，要是他现在跟我回去。我应该自己决定我怎么对付他，特拉伍德小姐——明白了吧。我到这里来是第一次，也是最后一次，来把他带走。如果您决定把他留下，那您就永远留着他吧。”</p>
<p>‘What do you say，David？’asked my aunt，turning to me．</p>
<p>“你说呢，大卫？”姨婆转过来问我。</p>
<p>‘Please don't let me go with them，aunt！’I begged．‘They've always been unkind to me，and they made my mother very unhappy．I'll be so miserable if I have to go back with them！’</p>
<p>“请不要让我跟他们走，姨婆！”我恳求道，“他们对我一向残酷，他们让我母亲不幸福。要是我跟他们回去，我会痛苦不堪！”</p>
<p>‘What do you think，Mr Dick？’asked my aunt．</p>
<p>“你的意见呢，迪克先生？”姨婆问道。</p>
<p>Mr Dick thought for a moment．‘Get a suit of clothes made for him immediately，’he said．</p>
<p>迪克先生想了一想，“给他弄块布来，立刻做套衣服。”他说道。</p>
<p>‘What would I do without you，Mr Dick！’asked my aunt，shaking his hand enthusiastically．Then she turned to Mr Murdstone．</p>
<p>“离了你我真是什么也干不了，迪克先生！”姨婆热情地握住他的手说道。然后，她转身对摩德斯通先生说：</p>
<p>‘You'd better go．I'll keep the boy and take my chance with him．I don't believe a word of your story．Do you think I don't know how you broke that poor girl's heart？And how you hated her son，and punished him for it？I can see by your face that I'm right．’We all stared at Mr Murdstone．It was true that his face was white and he was breathing fast．‘Good bye，sir，and goodbye to you too，madam，’added my aunt，turning suddenly to Miss Murdstone．‘If I see you riding on my grass again，I'll knock your hat right off your head！’</p>
<p>“你最好走吧。我会留下这孩子，看他到底是什么样的孩子。我不相信你说的任何一句话，你认为我不知道你是怎么伤透那位可怜的女孩的心，你是怎样恨她的儿子并因此而惩罚他？我可以从你脸上看出我是对的。”我们都盯着摩德斯通先生看，他的脸的确很苍白，并且呼吸急促。“再见，先生。还有你，女士。”姨婆突然转向摩德斯通小姐，补充道，“要是我再看见你踏进我的草坪，我会把你的帽子从你的脑袋上敲掉！”</p>
<p>The Murdstones said nothing in reply to these fierce words，but walked quickly out of the house．</p>
<p>摩德斯通姐弟对这些严厉的措词没做任何回答，他们很快走出了房间。</p>
<p>‘Thank you，thank you，aunt！’I cried．‘I'll do my best to make you proud of me！’and I kissed her many times．</p>
<p>“谢谢您，谢谢您，姨婆！”我叫道，“我会尽力让您为我自豪！”我亲了她好几下。</p>
<p>‘Mr Dick，you and I will adopt this boy together，’said my aunt，her stern expression softening into a smile．</p>
<p>“迪克先生，你和我将一起收养这个孩子，”姨婆说着，严肃的表情转化成一丝微笑。</p>
<p>And so a new life began for me．I was soon able to forget the warehouse and the Murdstones，in learning to please my aunt，and to play games with Mr Dick，who spent much of his time with me．</p>
<p>自此，我的新生活开始了。我努力让姨婆高兴，并和迪克先生玩游戏，他大部分时间都和我在一起，这样我很快就忘记了仓库和摩德斯通姐弟。</p>
<p>But one day my aunt suggested that I should go to boarding school in Canterbury．I was delighted，as I was eager to con tinue my studies，and Canterbury was very near my aunt's home in Dover．So the next day my aunt and I went to Can terbury，where I admired the beautiful old buildings in the an cient city centre．</p>
<p>可有一天，姨婆提议我应该到坎特伯雷寄宿学校去上学。我很高兴，因为我自己急切希望能继续学习，而坎特伯雷离多佛的姨婆家又很近。于是，姨婆陪我来到了坎特伯雷，我很欣赏这座城市中心美丽的旧式建筑。</p>
<p>‘Is it a large school，aunt？’I asked politely．</p>
<p>“那是一所很大的学校吗，姨婆？”我很有礼貌地问道。</p>
<p>‘I haven't decided which school you'll go to yet，’she replied．‘First we're going to ask my old friend Mr Wickfield's advice about it．He lives and works in Canterbury，you see．’</p>
<p>“我还没决定你上哪所学校，”她回答。“我们首先要听听我的老朋友威克菲尔先生对此的看法。他就住在坎特伯雷，在这儿工作，明白了吧。”</p>
<p>Soon we stopped in front of a very old house，with a very clean front doorstep，and fresh white curtains at the windows．A strange-looking person，dressed in black，with short red hair and a very thin white face came out to meet us．I thought he must be a servant．He was about fifteen，but looked much older．</p>
<p>很快，我们在一幢十分古旧的房子前停了下来。门前的台阶十分干净，窗户挂着洁白的窗帘。有一位相貌古怪、身着黑衣、留红色短发、面孔精瘦苍白的男子出来迎接我们。我想他一定是这家的仆人。他大概15岁，但看上去要大得多。</p>
<p>‘Is Mr Wickfield at home，Uriah Heep？’asked my aunt．</p>
<p>“威克菲尔先生在家吗，尤赖亚&middot;希普？”姨婆问他。</p>
<p>‘He is，madam，’replied Uriah，smiling unpleasantly．He showed us into the sitting-room，where I noticed two large paintings on the wall，one of a grey-haired gentleman and the other of a lady with a sweet，gentle face．Just then a gentle man entered the room，looking a little older than his picture．I soon discovered he was Mr Wickfield，my aunt's lawyer．</p>
<p>“在家，小姐，”尤赖亚回答，不自在地笑了笑。他领我们进了客厅，我注意到客厅墙上挂着两幅画像，一幅是位灰头发男子，另一幅是位恬静、温柔的女士。这时，一位先生走进客厅，显得比像片老些。我立刻意识到他就是威克菲尔先生，我姨婆的律师。</p>
<p>‘Mr Wickfield，’said my aunt，‘this is my nephew．I have adopted him，and I want to send him to a good boarding school here in Canterbury．Can you help me find a school for him？’</p>
<p>“威克菲尔先生，”姨婆说道，“这是我的外孙，我收养了他，我想送他上一所较好的寄宿学校，就在坎特伯雷城，您能帮我找一所吗？”</p>
<p>Mr Wickfield thought for a moment．‘There's a very good school I can recommend，Dr Strong's，but the boy can't board there，and it's too far to travel from Dover every day．However，he could live here，if you liked，in my house．There's plenty of room for him．’</p>
<p>威克菲尔先生想了一会儿，“我可以推荐他去一所非常好的学校，斯特朗博士学校，可学生不能寄宿，而且每天从多佛赶到这里也太远了。不过，他可以住在这儿，在我家，如果您愿意的话。家里有的是空房间。”</p>
<p>‘That's very kind of you，Mr Wickfield．I'll pay you for his food，of course，’said my aunt．</p>
<p>“您真是太好了，威克菲尔先生。当然他的生活费由我负担。”姨婆说。</p>
<p>‘Come and meet Agnes，who takes care of everything and manages the house，’said Mr Wickfield．We all went upstairs to another sitting-room，prettily furnished，where a girl of my own age was sitting．On her face I saw immediately the beau tiful，calm expression of the lady in the painting downstairs，and I knew she must be Mr Wickfield's daughter，Agnes．When I saw the way Mr Wickfield looked at Agnes and held her hand，I realized that she was the only thing that made life worth living for him．The lady in the painting was her mother，who had died some years before，and Agnes was now in complete charge of the house．She welcomed me warmly as a guest，and showed me the comfortable bedroom I would sleep in．My aunt was very happy to leave me in the care of Mr Wickfield and his daughter．</p>
<p>“来吧，见见阿格尼斯，她掌管着家里的一切，”威克菲尔先生说。我们来到楼上的另一个客厅，这里的陈设非常漂亮，一位年龄跟我相仿的姑娘坐在那儿。从她脸上我立刻看出了楼下像片中那位女士的那种美丽、安详的神情。我想她一定是威克菲尔先生的女儿阿格尼斯。从威克菲尔先生看阿格尼斯的眼神中和他握她手的方式中我意识到她是他生活中的唯一寄托。像片上的女士是她的母亲，几年前去世了，现在的这个家完全由阿格尼斯负责。她把我当成贵宾一样热情招待，并带我看了为我准备的舒适的卧房。姨婆很放心把我交给威克菲尔先生和她的女儿照顾。</p>
<p>‘I must leave now，David，’she told me．‘Mr Wickfield will take you to school tomorrow，and make all the arrange ments． I'm sure you will work hard，and do well．’</p>
<p>“我要走了，大卫，”她跟我说，“威克菲尔先生明天带你去学校，并为你安排一切。我相信你一定会好好学习，干出成就的。”</p>
<p>‘Thank you，aunt！’I said，trying not to cry．‘And give my love to Mr Dick！And thank you again！’</p>
<p>“谢谢您，姨婆！”我说道，尽力忍住不哭，“并代我问候迪克先生！再次感谢您！”</p>
<p>When she had gone，I dried my tears and spent a pleasant evening with the Wickfields．We ate supper and talked in the pretty little sitting－room．Agnes played the piano and tried to amuse her father，but he often looked serious and rather sad．During the evening he drank a good deal of wine．I wondered why he seemed unhappy．</p>
<p>她走后，我擦干眼泪，和威克菲尔一家度过了愉快的一晚上。我们就在这美丽的客厅里吃晚餐，聊天。阿格尼斯弹奏钢琴，设法取悦她父亲，可他总是很严肃，很忧郁。一晚上他喝了好多酒，我不知道他为什么显得不高兴。</p>
<p>The next day I had my first experience of a well－organized school．It could not have been more different from Salem House．The headmaster，Dr Strong，was a gentle，kind man who enjoyed teaching and never punished anybody．I soon made friends with the other boys，and as time went on，with the teachers too．But although I liked school very much，I was always happy to return to the Wickfields’quiet house every evening．There，Agnes used to help me with my studies and listen sympathetically to my problems，and her father always seemed pleased to see me．I often wrote to my aunt and Peg gotty，and Mr Dick came to visit me once a week．</p>
<p>第二天，我第一次感受到了一个正规学校的气氛。它与萨伦学校有着天壤之别。校长斯特朗博士温和、友善，热爱教学，从不惩罚任何人。不久我就和这里的孩子们成了朋友，而且时间一长，跟老师们也成了朋友。然而，尽管我非常喜欢学校，我还是很高兴每天晚上回到威克菲尔先生那安静的家。在那儿，阿格尼斯常常帮助我做功课，并极为同情地听我诉说我的难题。她父亲见着我也总是显得很高兴。我常写信给姨婆，给辟果提，迪克先生每星期都来看我一次。</p>
<p>The strangest person in my new life was Uriah Heep．Soon after I arrived in Canterbury，we had a conversation one evening．He was doing a lot of Mr Wickfield's work，and was working late in his small office，just off the hall of the Wick fields’house．</p>
<p>我新生活中遇到的最奇特的人物就是尤赖亚&middot;希普。我到坎特伯雷后不久，一天晚上我们进行了一次谈话。威克菲尔先生的很多事情都由他在做，他在他的小办公室里干得很晚，那间办公室离威克菲尔先生家大厅很近。</p>
<p>‘Come in，come in，Master Copperfield！’he cried when he saw me passing the door．I entered，and found him reading a large dusty book，and making careful notes in a notebook．</p>
<p>“进来，进来，科波菲尔少爷！”他看见我从门前经过就叫住了我。我进去了，见他正在读一本厚厚的、满是灰尘的书，并认真地做着笔记。</p>
<p>‘What are you studying，Uriah？’I asked politely．</p>
<p>“你在学什么，尤赖亚？”我礼貌地问道。</p>
<p>‘I'm going to be a lawyer，’he replied，rubbing his thin hands together and smiling his oily smile．</p>
<p>“我准备做一名律师，”他边说边搓着他细瘦的手指，僵硬地笑了笑。</p>
<p>‘You're Mr Wickfield's assistant，aren't you？Perhaps one day you'll be his partner，’I said，trying to make conversation．</p>
<p>“你是威克菲尔先生的助手，是吗？或许哪天你会成为他的合作伙伴，”我没话找话地说道。</p>
<p>‘Oh no，Master Copperfield！’cried Uriah，rolling his eyes upwards．‘I could never rise so high！No，I'm much too humble for that！But thank you，Master Copperfield，for thinking kindly of me．And may I say，that if ever you have the time（and I'm sure a young gentleman like you is much too busy to spare the time for a poor person like me），my mother and I would be glad to offer you a cup of tea at our humble home．’</p>
<p>“哦，不，科波菲尔少爷！”尤赖亚叫起来，两眼往上一翻。“我不会升得这么高！不，我太卑微，够不上那种职位！但还是谢谢你，科波菲尔少爷！谢谢你能这么看我。恕我冒昧，如果你有时间（我肯定像你这样的年轻人会忙得匀不出时间给我这样的可怜人），我母亲和我很高兴邀请你去我们卑微的家里喝杯茶。”</p>
<p>‘Of course—if I have time，’I answered，and left the room quickly．I did not feel comfortable with him，for some reason．</p>
<p>“当然可以——只要我有时间，”我回答道，并很快离开了房间。不知什么原因，跟他在一起我感到很不自在。</p>
<p>But the following week he invited me to tea again，and I did not want to appear rude，so I agreed．That evening he and I walked to the small house where he lived with his mother．It was a warm day and we were drinking our tea near the open door when a gentleman I recognized passed by．It was Mr Mi cawber！He saw me sitting near the door and called out．‘Cop perfield！Is it really you？’</p>
<p>紧接着的第二个星期，他再次邀请我去喝茶，我不想失礼，所以同意了。那天晚上，他带我到了他和他母亲居住的小屋子。那天天气暖和，我们坐在敞开的门边喝茶，这时有一个我熟识的身影从门口走过。是米考伯先生！他见我站在门口就叫起来，“科波菲尔！真的是你吗？”</p>
<p>I was delighted to see him again，and Mrs Heep invited him in for some tea．I had to introduce him to the Heeps，but I did not think that Uriah would be a good influence on Mr Micaw ber．However，I was interested to discover that the Micawbers were now living in Canterbury，as nothing had‘turned up’in Devon．They seemed to be very short of money again，and surrounded by creditors as usual．I left the Heeps’house as soon as possible，taking Mr Micawber with me，as I did not want him to tell Uriah all about my life at the warehouse in London．</p>
<p>我很高兴和他重逢，希普太太邀请他进屋喝茶，我只好把他介绍给希普母子。但我并没想到尤赖亚后来会对米考伯先生产生巨大的影响。不管怎么说，我感兴趣的是知道米考伯一家现住在坎特伯雷，因为在德文并没出现“转机”。他们似乎又缺钱了，又像以前那样债台高筑。我尽快离开了希普家，把米考伯先生带出来，因为我不想让他告诉尤赖亚我在伦敦仓库工作时的全部生活。</p>
<p>And so the years passed．I learnt everything that Dr Strong and his teachers could teach me，and at seventeen，came to the end of my schooldays．My aunt suggested that，before decid ing what profession to choose，I should spend a month in Lon don or travelling round the country．This would give me time to consider my next step．I agreed enthusiastically，and al though I was sorry to say goodbye to my sweet friend Agnes and her father，I was looking forward to leading the life of an independent young gentleman．</p>
<p>一晃几年过去了，我学到了斯特朗博士和老师们能教给我的所有知识。17岁那年我的学生生涯结束了。姨婆建议我在决定选择职业前先去伦敦或附近的城镇度一个月假，这样可以有充分的时间考虑一下下一步的打算。我热切地表示同意，尽管与恬静的朋友阿格尼斯和她父亲道别令我难过，我还是期望能过一种独立的、年轻人的生活。</p><a href='5.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
