<p><b>5 大卫重逢老朋友 </b></p>
<p>I decided to go to London first，to stay at a hotel for a few nights，and see all the sights of that great city．I knew it would be very different from the last time I was in London，when I was working at the warehouse．Now I was adult，and educated，and had money．</p>
<p>我决定先到伦敦，在旅馆里住上几天，把那大城市的风光景致游览个遍。我知道这一次与我上次到伦敦仓库工作时的情景会大不一样。如今我已长大成人，受过教育，身上有了钱。</p>
<p>The hotel I chose was called the Golden Cross，and because I looked so young，I was given a very small，dark room in the roof．But I did not feel confident enough to complain．</p>
<p>我选择了一家取名“金十字”的旅馆，由于我看上去很年轻，他们就给我开了一间阁楼上又小又黑的房间。而我当时还没有足够的勇气抱怨。</p>
<p>That evening I was returning from the theatre when I recognized someone going into the hotel．I could not prevent my self from saying at once，‘Steerforth！Do you remember me？’</p>
<p>那天晚上，我从戏院回来，见一个熟悉的身影走进旅馆。我禁不住脱口叫道：“斯提福兹！你还认识我吗？”</p>
<p>He stared at me for a moment．Then he cried，‘Good heavens！It's little Copperfield！’</p>
<p>他看了我一会儿，然后叫起来，“我的天！是小科波菲尔！”</p>
<p>I was so delighted to see him that I held both his hands，saying，‘My dear Steerforth，you have no idea how pleased I am to see you again！’I remembered how much I had admired him，and all my love for him came back．I had to brush away the tears from my eyes．</p>
<p>见到他，我欣喜异常，我紧握住他的双手说：“亲爱的斯提福兹，你不会知道再次见到你我有多高兴！”我记得我是多么地敬重他，我对他的敬慕又一次升华。我的双眼涌满泪花，我只好赶紧擦掉。</p>
<p>‘Don't cry，Copperfield，old boy！’he said kindly．‘I'm glad to see you too．What are you doing here？’</p>
<p>“别哭，科波菲尔，老伙计！”他和善地说道，“我也很高兴见到你，你在这里干什么？”</p>
<p>‘I've just finished school，and my aunt has sent me to Lon don to look around before deciding on a profession．What about you，Steerforth？’</p>
<p>“我刚毕业，我姨婆让我在选择职业之前先到伦敦转转。你呢，斯提福兹？”</p>
<p>‘Well，I'm studying at Oxford University，but nothing ex citing ever happens there！That's why I'm in London for a few days．But it's boring here too，isn't it？’</p>
<p>“嗯，我在牛津大学上学，可那儿没什么好玩的事！所以我来伦敦呆几天，但这儿也很无聊，是吧？”</p>
<p>‘In London？’I asked，surprised．‘I think it's wonderful！There's so much to do and see！I've just been to the theatre—the actors were excellent and—’</p>
<p>“伦敦吗？”我很纳闷，问道。“我觉得很好呀！有那么多事可做可看！我刚去了戏院——那些演员棒极了，还有——”</p>
<p>‘David，David！’laughed Steerforth．‘It does me good to see your fresh，innocent face，so full of excitement！Now，let me see，which room are staying in？’</p>
<p>“大卫，大卫，”斯提福兹笑道，“看到你这张好奇、天真的脸，这么激动，真让我高兴！现在，告诉我，你住哪个房间？”</p>
<p>‘Number 44．It's rather high up，’I confessed，blushing．</p>
<p>“44号，在楼顶上，”我红着脸直说了。</p>
<p>‘They've put you in number 44？I'll soon change that．’And when Steerforth complained to the manager，I was imme diately given a large，airy，comfortable room on the first floor，next to his．That night as I fell asleep I thought happily of the next few days，which Steerforth and I were planning to spend together．</p>
<p>“他们把你安置在44号？我马上给你换房。”斯提福兹找老板谈了以后，他们很快把我安排在楼下一层的一间宽敞、通风、舒适的房间，而且在斯提福兹的隔壁。晚上躺下睡觉时，我很高兴，想着接下来的几天我可以和斯提福兹在一起玩。</p>
<p>A week passed very quickly，with visits to the theatre，the museums and the zoo．We went sightseeing，riding，swimming and boating．Steerforth was the perfect companion to have，and I admired him even more than before．In fact，I loved him with all my heart．</p>
<p>一周很快过去了，我们一起看戏，参观博物馆、动物园，我们一起观光、骑马、游泳、划船，斯提福兹是一位难得的好伙伴，我比以前更敬重他了。实际上，我已经真心真意喜爱他了。</p>
<p>One day I said to him，‘You know，Steerforth，I really must go and visit my mother's old servant， Peggotty．She was very good to me when I was a child．’</p>
<p>一天，我跟他说，“你知道，斯提福兹，我必须去看看我母亲的老女仆，辟果提，我小时候她对我很好。”</p>
<p>‘Yes，David，I remember you told me．She lives in Yarmouth now， doesn't she？Why don't we go there together？’</p>
<p>“是，大卫，我记得你跟我说过。她住在雅茅斯，是吧？干吗不一起去呢？”</p>
<p>‘Oh yes，Steerforth！You'd enjoy meeting her brothef，and all the family！They're very kind，good people．’</p>
<p>“哦！对呀，斯提福兹！你一定很乐意见见她的哥哥及他的全家！他们都是非常友好、善良的人。”</p>
<p>‘Even if they are only working people，’said Steerforth．I looked quickly at him to see what he meant，but he was smiling at me，so I knew he was joking，and I smiled too．</p>
<p>“即便他们只是普通的劳苦大众，”斯提福兹说。我瞥了他一眼，想弄清他话中的含义，但他冲我笑笑，我想他是在开玩笑，所以我也笑了笑。</p>
<p>We travelled to Yarmouth by coach，and when we arrived，Steerforth stayed at the hotel while I went to Barkis's house to find Peggotty．When I knocked at the door，Peggotty opened it，and did not recognize me for a moment．I had continued to write to her regularly，but we had not seen each other for seven years，and I was no longer the small boy she remembered．But when she realized I was her Master David，she sobbed and sobbed with delight，holding me in her arms as she had always done．Soon she was calmer，and we talked about the events of the last few years．I heard that she was very happy with Mr Barkis，who；however，was ill in bed at the time．She was so pleased to see me that she insisted I should sleep at her house during my stay in Yarmouth，in the little bedroom she had al ways kept for me．</p>
<p>我们乘坐长途马车到雅茅斯，到了之后，斯提福兹先在一家旅馆落脚，我到巴克斯家去找辟果提。我敲了敲门，辟果提出来了，她当时没认出我。我虽然一直给她写信，从未间断，但我们彼此已有7年没见面，我已不再是她记忆中的小男孩了。然而，当她意识到我就是她的大卫少爷时，她激动得哭了又哭，还象从前那样把我拥在她怀里，她很快就平静了下来，我们互相说起近几年发生的事情。她说她跟巴克斯先生过得很幸福，可他现在却生病在床。她见到我是那么高兴，坚持要我在雅茅斯逗留期间住到他们家，睡那间她一直为我保留着的小卧房。</p>
<p>The next day I took Steerforth with me to visit Daniel Peg gotty．It was a dark and windy winter evening．As we came closer to the old boat，we heard happy voices and laughter in side．I opened the door，and suddenly I was surrounded by Daniel，Ham and Emily，all looking very surprised．</p>
<p>第二天，我带斯提福兹去拜访丹尼尔&middot;辟果提。那是个黑暗、多风的夜晚，我们走近老船屋，听得里面传出快乐的说笑声。我推开门，丹尼尔、哈姆和埃米莉突然围过来，惊奇地看着我。</p>
<p>‘Look！It's Master David！Look how he's grown！’</p>
<p>“看！是大卫少爷！他长成大人了！”</p>
<p>And for a moment we were all shaking hands and talking and laughing at the same time．I did not forget to introduce Steerforth．They welcomed him warmly as my best friend．</p>
<p>一时间我们都握着手又说又笑。我没忘了介绍斯提福兹。他们把他当作我的好朋友热情接待。</p>
<p>‘Well！’cried Daniel Peggotty，his large face red and shin ing with delight．‘It's wonderful，Master David，that you two gentlemen have come here tonight of all nights！The best night of my life！Because tonight，gentlemen，my little Emily—’and he took Emily's small white hand in his rough red one and placed it on his heart—‘has agreed to become Ham's wife！’</p>
<p>“好啊！”丹尼尔&middot;辟果提叫道，激动得大脸庞又红又亮。“太好啦，大卫少爷，你们两位先生选择今晚到这里！这是我一生中最美好的夜晚！因为今天晚上，先生们，我的小埃米莉——”他把小埃米莉白皙的小手握在自己粗糙发红的手中并放到胸口——“已经答应嫁给哈姆当妻子！”</p>
<p>‘I congratulate you with all my heart，’said Steerforth politely to Ham，without taking his eyes off Emily，who was blushing prettily．</p>
<p>“我衷心地祝贺你，”斯提福兹出于礼貌对哈姆说道，可他的眼睛始终没有离开脸颊菲红的美丽的埃米莉。</p>
<p>‘Master David knows how I love this girl，’continued old Daniel，‘and my dearest wish was for her to have a good husband to take care of her． And there's no one I trust more than Ham！He's only a rough sailor like me，but he's honest，and sincere，and I know she'll come to no harm while he lives！’</p>
<p>“大卫少爷知道我有多爱这孩子，”老丹尼尔继续道，“我最大的心愿就是她能找到一位好丈夫照顾她。而我最信任的人莫过于哈姆！他虽然只是一个像我一样粗鲁的水手，但他朴实、真诚，我知道只要有他在她决不会受到任何伤害！”</p>
<p>Meanwhile，Ham was blushing too．I did not know what to say，unsure whether I still loved Emily and was therefore jealous of Ham，or whether I was glad they were going to be happy together．But steerforth always knew the right thing to say，and with a few well-chosen words he made us all feel much more comfortable．</p>
<p>这时，哈姆也脸红了。我不知道说什么好，不知道是因还爱着埃米莉而妒嫉哈姆，还是为他们的幸福而高兴。然而，斯提福兹总能说出合适的话语，他的几句很得体的话让大家都觉得自在多了。</p>
<p>We spent the rest of the evening very pleasantly，telling stories and singing songs，and it was midnight when Steerforth and I left the old boat．</p>
<p>接下来的时间我们过得很愉快，大家讲故事、唱歌，一直到午夜时分，我和斯提福兹才离开船屋。</p>
<p>‘Well！’said Steerforth to me as we walked across the sand in the cold night air．‘What a lovely girl！And what a coarse young man she's engaged to！’</p>
<p>“咳！”我们在寒冷的夜色中穿过沙滩，斯提福兹说，“多可爱的女孩！却要嫁给这么粗俗的男人！”</p>
<p>I was shocked by these unexpectedly cold words．But when I turned to him and saw him smiling，I replied warmly，‘Ah，Steerforth！You pretend to laugh at people who are poorer or less educated than yourself，but I've just seen you spend the whole evening with the Peggotty family，making them happy！I know you understand and love them，and I admire you all the more for it！’</p>
<p>他突然说出这么尖刻的话使我感到震惊，可当我回过头看他脸上挂着笑容时，我热情地附和道：“啊，斯提福兹！你假装嘲笑那些比你寒酸、没文化的人，可我刚看到你和辟果提一家整个晚上在一起，逗他们开心！我知道你了解他们，喜欢他们，我更加仰慕你了！”</p>
<p>He stopped and looked at me，saying rather sadly，‘David，you're serious，aren't you？I wish I were as good as you！’</p>
<p>他停下脚步看着我，心情沉重地说：“大卫，你是认真的，对吧？我真希望我能像你这么好！”</p>
<p>For the next two weeks I was often with Peggotty and Barkis，while Steerforth went sailing or fishing with Daniel and Ham，or found other things to do，so I did not see very much of him．Finally we decided to return to London．</p>
<p>接下来的两个星期我常和辟果提和巴克斯在一起，而斯提福兹常随丹尼尔和哈姆去航海、钓鱼，或者找些其他事干，所以我不常见着他。最后我们决定回伦敦。</p>
<p>While we were travelling back on the coach，I turned to say something，and was surprised to see how miserable he looked．</p>
<p>当我们坐上返程的长途马车时，我转身想跟他说些什么，却惊奇地发现他居然是满面愁容。</p>
<p>‘Oh，David！’he said unhappily．‘I wish I could control myself better！I hate myself sometimes！’</p>
<p>“噢，大卫！”他痛苦地说，“我真希望能更好地把握住自己！我有时恨死我自己了！”</p>
<p>‘Steerforth！What can you mean！’I cried．‘You're the best，the most intelligent，the kindest of men！’</p>
<p>“斯提福兹！你在说什么呀！”我叫道，“你是最优秀、最聪明、最好心肠的人！”</p>
<p>‘Thank you，David，’he said，shaking his head，‘but you don't know how bad I am．’</p>
<p>“谢谢你，大卫！”他摇了摇头，说道，“但你不知道我有多坏。”</p>
<p>‘Bad！’I repeated．‘My dear Steerforth！Don't say that！I know your character well，and I'm proud to call you my friend！’</p>
<p>“坏！”我重复道，“我亲爱的斯提福兹！别胡说了！我很了解你的性格，和你成朋友是我的荣幸。”</p>
<p>In a little while his mood changed，and he became cheerful again．I soon forgot his words，but I remembered them later．</p>
<p>片刻之后，他的情绪有了改观，重新高兴起来。我很快忘了他的这些话，可后来我又回想起来了。</p>
<p>In London I discovered that my aunt had arrived at the Colden Cross Hotel，and had booked a room there for several days．We were delighted to see each other，and had a long conversation that evening．She had come to ask me a particular question．</p>
<p>回伦敦后，我发现姨婆早就等在“金十字”旅馆了，而且已经在那儿住了好几天了。彼此相见我们都很高兴，当晚聊了很久。她为一个问题专程来问我。</p>
<p>‘David，’she said very seriously，‘I've been thinking about your future profession．How would you feel about becoming a lawyer？’</p>
<p>“大卫，”她十分严肃地说，’我一直都在考虑你今后的工作间题，你觉得做律师怎么样？”</p>
<p>I thought for a moment．‘Well，aunt，it sounds a very good idea．I confess I hadn't considered it before，but I think I'd like it．’</p>
<p>我想了一会儿，“好啊，姨婆，听起来这主意不错。我承认我以前没想到过，但我想我会喜欢的。”</p>
<p>‘Very good，’said my aunt，jumping up．‘In that case，let's go immediately to see Mr Spenlow．He's a partner in an important law firm，and I think he'll agree to train you．We'll have to pay him，of course，but after several years you'll be a properly trained lawyer，and be able to earn your own money．’</p>
<p>“很好，”姨婆说着跳起来，“既然这样，我们马上去见斯本罗先生，他是一家颇为重要的律师事务所的合伙人，我想他会同意收你为徒，当然我们得付学费。可几年下来你就能成为一名训练有素的律师，而且可以自己挣钱。”</p>
<p>And so we carried out this plan．My aunt paid Mr Spenlow's firm a thousand pounds，and I promised to work hard and do my best to become a successful lawyer．Before she returned to Dover，my aunt rented a small flat for me，at the top of a house near the lawcourts，and I moved in at once．</p>
<p>紧接着，我们实施了这项计划。姨婆付给斯本罗事务所1000英镑，我答应努力学习，尽可能成为一名成功的律师。姨婆回多佛之前，给我租了一套小房子，位于法院附近一幢楼的顶层，我很快搬了进去。</p>
<p>At first it seemed very exciting to walk through the busy streets after a long day in the courts or at Mr Spenlow's dusty office，and know that I had my own home to return to．But when I had climbed up all the stairs，and entered my sitting room，it no longer seemed so exciting．In fact，my flat looked empty and depressing．So，after two days of loneliness，I was very glad to receive my first visitor，Steerforth，and because I was so happy to see him，I invited him and two friends of his to dinner the next evening．</p>
<p>一开始，我每天从法院或斯本罗事务所那满是尘土的办公室工作一天之后，穿过热闹繁华的街区，想到我也有自己的家可回，就异常兴奋。可当我爬完所有的楼梯，走进客厅，似乎就不再那么兴奋了。事实上，我的房间看上去空荡荡的，令人抑郁。所以，孤单单地呆了两天后，我很高兴我的第一位客人斯提福兹来访。见到他后我非常开心。于是又邀请他和他的两位朋友第二天晚上到我的寓所聚餐。</p>
<p>As it was my first dinner party，I did not know what to buy，but I ordered cooked dishes of chicken and fish from the restaurant，bought cheese and fruit from the market，and had a large number of bottles of wine delivered．I was quite fright ened by how much money I had spent，but when Steerforth and his friends arrived，I soon became more cheerful．The party was a great success，and we all enjoyed ourselves very much．We ate，and drank，and smoked，and drank again．I was constantly opening bottles of wine，and became unusually talkative．I began to feel rather strange，and when I caught sight of myself in a mirror，I seemed very pale．I had to confess to myself that I looked drunk．</p>
<p>由于我是头一次搞聚餐，不知道该买什么，就从餐馆里预定了现成的一只鸡和一条鱼，又从商店里买了些奶酪和水果，还让人送到家好几瓶酒。自己一下子花掉那么多钱，真有点可怕。可当斯提福兹和他的朋友到来之后，我的心情立刻好转了。聚会办得十分成功，我们玩得很开心，我们边吃边喝边抽烟，然后又喝。我不停地打开一瓶又一瓶的酒，而且变得异常健谈，我开始感觉不对劲，照着镜子一看，自己已脸色苍白。我不得不承认自己的醉态。</p>
<p>Someone suggested going to the theatre，and in a kind of mist we left my flat and walked through the streets．Steerforth was holding my arm and laughing．Then a man in a little box looked out of the fog，and took money from somebody．Soon we were sitting high up in a very hot，very crowded theatre．There were bright lights，and there was music，but I could not understand what anyone was saying，and the whole building seemed to swim in front of my eyes．</p>
<p>有人提议去看戏，我们就迷迷糊糊地走出我的寓所来到街上。斯提福兹嘻笑着搀着我的胳膊。小包箱里有一个人从雾里探出头来，偷走了另一个人的钱。很快，我们坐进了燥热、拥挤的戏院，而且高高在上。戏院里有明亮的灯光，有音乐，但我听不懂演员在说什么，整个建筑物仿佛在我眼前晃动。</p>
<p>Then someone suggested going to visit some friends in an other part of the theatre，so we went downstairs．Suddenly I saw，quite clearly，Agnes Wickfield，sitting with a lady and gentleman．She was looking at me with a surprised expression on her face．</p>
<p>之后，有人提议去戏院的另一头看看几位朋友，所以我们又下了楼。突然，我十分清楚地看见阿格尼斯&middot;威克菲尔，她与一位女士和一位先生坐在一起。她看着我，一脸惊讶的神色。</p>
<p>‘Good heavens！’I cried．‘Agnes！You're in London！’</p>
<p>“我的天！”我叫起来，“阿格尼斯！你在伦敦！”</p>
<p>‘Quiet！’she whispered．‘People are trying to listen to the actors．You'll disturb them！’Then she added kindly，‘David，please do what I say．Ask your friends to take you home．’</p>
<p>“安静！”她小声说道，“别人都在听戏，你会吵着他们的！”然后她又善意地加了一句：“大卫，请照我说的做，让你的朋友送你回家。”</p>
<p>I had always taken Agnes's advice，and I did so this time．I do not remember how I got home，but I do remember Steer forth helping me to undress and get into bed．What a terrible，sleepless night I spent！How ill I felt！How dry my mouth was！But the next morning I felt even worse．I was so miser able and ashamed that I had been so stupid，and that Agnes had seen me drunk．I could not even apologize to her，because I did not know where she was staying in London．I spent the whole day with my head in my hands，in my dirty，smoky room，surrounded by empty wine bottles．</p>
<p>阿格尼斯的意见我向来都听，这次也一样。我不记得当时是怎么回的家，但我依然记得是斯提福兹帮我脱了衣服，把我弄上床。多么可怕、难眠的一宿！我感觉好难受！口干舌燥！而第二天上午情况更糟，我为自己所干的蠢事感到既痛苦又羞愧，还让阿格尼斯看见了我的醉态。我甚至没法向她致歉，因为我不知道她住在伦敦的哪个地方。我双手捧着自己的脑袋，在脏乱不堪、乌烟障气、满是空酒瓶的屋子里呆了一整天。</p>
<p>But the next day a note was delivered to my flat．It was from Agnes，asking me to visit her at the house where she was staying．I went straight there after my day's work at the office．</p>
<p>第二天，有人给我的寓所送来一张便条，是阿格尼斯写的，她要求我到她现在住的地方去找她。我下了班就直奔她那儿。</p>
<p>She looked so quiet and good，and reminded me so much of my happy schooldays in Canterbury，that I could not help crying．</p>
<p>她看上去是那么文静，气色那么好，让我回想起在坎特伯雷城那段美好的学生生活，我情不自禁地哭起来。</p>
<p>‘I'm so sorry，Agnes，’I said，‘that you saw me like that．I wish I were dead！’</p>
<p>“真抱歉，阿格尼斯，”我说，“让你瞧见我的蠢样。我真没脸见你！”</p>
<p>‘David，don't be unhappy，’she said cheerfully．‘You know you can trust me，and I'll always be your friend．’</p>
<p>“大卫，别难过了，”她愉悦地说道，“你知道你可以相信我，我永远是你的朋友。”</p>
<p>I took her hand and kissed it．‘Agnes，you're my good angel！’</p>
<p>我抓起她的手吻了一下，“阿格尼斯，你是我的天使！”</p>
<p>She shook her head．‘No，David，but if I were，I'd warn you—to stay away from your bad angel．’</p>
<p>她摇了摇头，“不，大卫，如果我真是，我要提醒你——离开你的坏天使。”</p>
<p>‘My dear Agnes！’I cried．‘Do you mean Steerforth？’</p>
<p>“亲爱的阿格尼斯！”我叫道，“你是指斯提福兹？”</p>
<p>‘I do，David，’she replied，looking firmly at me．</p>
<p>“是的，大卫，”她回答，坚定地注视着我。</p>
<p>‘Agnes，you're wrong！He is my trusted friend！He helps and guides me！It wasn't his fault that I got drunk，you know！’</p>
<p>“阿格尼斯，你错了！他是我信任的朋友！他帮助我，引导我！我喝醉不是他的错，你知道！”</p>
<p>‘I wasn't thinking of that．I judge him from what you've told me about him，and your character，and his influence over you．’Agnes spoke very seriously，and her words went straight to my heart．‘I'm certain I'm right．You've made a dangerous friend，David，because you're so trusting．Please remember what I say—and forgive me for saying it．’</p>
<p>“我不是指醉酒的事。我是从你谈起他的话语中，从你的性格和他对你所产生的影响来判断的。”阿格尼斯认真地说道，她的话触动了我的心。“我认定我是对的。你结识了一位危险的朋友，大卫，因为你太容易轻信他人了。请记住我的话——并请原谅我的直率。”</p>
<p>‘I will，if you forgive me for getting drunk．’</p>
<p>“我会的，只要你能原谅我的酒后失态。”</p>
<p>Agnes agreed，smiling，and then said suddenly，‘Have you seen Uriah Heep？’</p>
<p>阿格尼斯笑着答应着，然后她突然问道，“你见过尤赖亚&middot;希普吗？”</p>
<p>‘No，’I replied．‘Is he in London？What's he doing here？’</p>
<p>“没有啊，”我回答，“他在伦敦吗？他来这里来干什么？”</p>
<p>‘I'm worried，David，’answered Agnes with sadness in her beautiful eyes．‘I think he's going to be Father's partner．’</p>
<p>“我很担心，大卫，”阿格尼斯回答，美丽的双眼蒙上一层郁忧。“我想他将要成为父亲的合伙人了。”</p>
<p>I remembered Uriah Heep's oily smile，and how uncomfort able he always used to make me feel．</p>
<p>我想起尤赖亚&middot;希普那僵硬的笑，他总是让人那么的不舒服。</p>
<p>‘What？That creature？He's so unpleasant！You must pre vent your father from agreeing to it，Agnes！’</p>
<p>“什么？那个怪物？他实在不讨人喜欢！你必须阻止你父亲与他合伙经营，阿格尼斯！”</p>
<p>Agnes smiled miserably．‘My poor father has no choice．You know how unhappy he has often been？And of course you've seen him drinking．You see，he loved my mother very much，and when she died，he didn't care so much about his work．That's when he started drinking．Uriah's very clever—he knows all this，and he's been very useful to Father，doing all the work that Father had forgotten or didn't want to do．Father really needs Uriah now，to keep his business going．And Uriah himself pretends to be humble and grateful，but in fact he's in a strong position，and is insisting on becoming a partner．Father is ashamed of himself，but he has to agree．Poor Father！I'd do anything to help him，any thing！’And Agnes sobbed bitterly．</p>
<p>阿格尼斯苦笑了一下，“可怜的父亲没有别的选择，你知道他常常是多么的忧郁？当然你也见过他酗酒。你知道，他非常爱我的母亲，她死后，他便不在那么专心他的工作。也就是那时他开始酗酒。尤赖亚很聪明——他知道这一切，他对父亲帮助很大，帮父亲做所有他忘记做或者不想做的事情。如今，为了能继续维持他的公司，父亲的确已经离不了尤赖亚了。尤赖亚自己则装出一幅卑谦、感恩戴德的样子，而实际上，他占据上风，坚持要做父亲的合伙人。父亲为自己感到羞愧，可也不得不同意。可怜的父亲！我愿意做任何事情来帮助他！任何事！”阿格尼斯伤心痛哭。以前我从未见阿格尼斯哭过。</p>
<p>I had never seen Agnes cry before．It made me so sad that I could only say helplessly，‘My dear Agnes！Please don't cry！’However，in a few minutes she was calm again，and I was able to leave her，promising to visit her and her father in Canter bury very soon．</p>
<p>我难过得只能说些无济于事的话，“亲爱的阿格尼斯！求你别哭了！”不过，几分钟后，她又恢复了平静，我也能告辞出来了，我答应她我会很快去坎特伯雷看望她和她的父亲。</p><a href='6.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
