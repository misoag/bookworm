<p><b>9 奥利弗开始了另一种生活 </b></p>
<p>In a comfortable, pleasant sitting－room, the two ladies of the house waited anxiously for the doctor and the police to arrive. The owner of the house, Mrs May lie, was an older woman, but her niece, Rose, was a girl of seventeen, whose quiet beauty and gentle charm won all hearts.</p>
<p>在一间舒适宜人的客厅里，房子里的两位女士正在焦急地等待着警察和医生的到来。房屋的主人梅利太太年纪比较大一些，可是她的侄女罗斯是一位十七岁的小姐，她安详的美貌和温柔的魅力赢得了每个人的心。</p>
<p>As soon as the doctor arrived, he ran breathlessly into the house and burst into the room without knocking. He was clearly a good friend of the ladies.</p>
<p>医生一赶到就上气不接下气地跑到房子里，顾不得敲门便冲进了屋。很显然，他是女士们的好朋友。</p>
<p>'I never heard of such a dreadful thing! You should both be dead of fright! he said to Mrs May lie. 'In the silence of the night, too! Are you both all right? Why didn't you send for me at once? '</p>
<p>“我还从没听说过这么吓人的事！你们俩竟然还没被吓死！”他跟梅利太太说，“又是深更半夜的！你们俩没什么事吧？为什么当时不赶紧派人去叫我呢？”</p>
<p>'We are quite all right, said Rose, smiling. 'But the re's an injured boy upstairs whom aunt wants you to see. '</p>
<p>“我们倒是好好的没事，”罗斯微笑着说，“不过楼上有个受了伤的男孩子，姑妈想请您来看看。”</p>
<p>Dr Losberne went up to examine Oliver, and was the re for some time He came down looking rather puzzled, and asked the two ladies to see the boy with him.</p>
<p>罗斯伯恩医生上楼去看奥利弗，待了好一阵子。他满脸迷惑不解地走下来，请两位女士一起上去看看那孩子。</p>
<p>'I can promise you the re's nothing very frightening about him, 'he said.</p>
<p>“我肯定这孩子没有什么可怕的，”他说。</p>
<p>Instead of the evil－looking robber They expected to see, the two ladies found only a pale, thin child, lying peacefully asleep.</p>
<p>这两位妇女看到的不是一个相貌可怕的盗贼，而是一个苍白、瘦弱的孩子，躺在那儿安静地睡着。</p>
<p>He looked to innocent that Mrs May lie said, 'This child could never have been in a gang of robbers! '</p>
<p>他看上去那么单纯，以至于梅利太太说：“这孩子不可能参加盗贼的团伙！”</p>
<p>'It certainly seems strange, agreed the doctor, 'but wickedness can hide behind the most gentle face, you know. '</p>
<p>“这件事看来确实挺奇怪的，”医生表示同意说，“可你也别忘了，邪恶是可能隐藏在善良的面貌背后的。”</p>
<p>'But he's so young, too! ' cried Rose. 'Can you really believe this poor boy is a criminal? Oh, Dr Losberne, and my dear aunt, I beg you both to have pity on him. '</p>
<p>“可他还是个孩子！”罗斯嚷着，“你们真能相信他是个罪犯吗？哎呀，罗斯伯恩医生，亲爱的姑妈，求你们发发善心吧。”</p>
<p>Mrs May lie did not need persuading, and the doctor could not resist Rose's tears. He had, in fact, an extremely kind heart, which he tried to hide behind a quick, fierce manner- though this usually deceived no one.</p>
<p>梅利太太用不着劝说，而这位医生更经不住罗斯小姐的眼泪。其实他是个非常好心的人，他试图将善良隐藏在一种厉害而性急的态度背后——但这通常瞒不了任何人。</p>
<p>'Well, what's to be done, the n? ' he said quickly. 'We'll have the police here at any moment, ready to take the boy away and throw him into prison! '</p>
<p>“那么现在该怎么办？”他急忙说，“警察随时会赶到，他们会把他带走，关进监狱。”</p>
<p>Rose begged him to think of a plan, and the doctor thought hard for a few minutes, frowning fiercely. At last he said, 'I've got it! ' and rubbed his hand s together in satisfaction.</p>
<p>罗斯求他赶紧想个法子。医生紧锁眉头，苦苦沉思了几分钟。终于，他满意地搓着两只手说：“有了！”</p>
<p>A little later, Oliver woke up and was very anxious to tell his story, although he had lost a lot of blood and was very weak. When the doctor and the ladies had heard all about his sad life, They were quite sure that They wanted to save Oliver from any unfair punishment. So Dr Losberne went down to the kitchen to talk to the three servants who had surprised Sikes and Oliver during the robbery. The doctor folded his arms and gave the men a long, hard stare.</p>
<p>一会儿，奥利弗醒来了，尽管他失血过多，非常虚弱，但他还是迫不急待地述说了自己的经历。医生和两位女士得知了奥利弗悲惨的身世后，便决定要帮助他，使他免受不公正的惩罚。因此，罗斯伯恩医生到下面的厨房里去和当晚撞见了赛克斯和奥利弗来偷窃的三名仆人说说这事。他将双手交插在胸前，盯着那三个人看了一会儿。</p>
<p>'Tell me, ' he began, can you be absolutely sure that the boy upstairs is the same one that was in the house last night? Well? '</p>
<p>“告诉我，”他说，“你们敢绝对肯定楼上的那个孩子就一定是昨天晚上进到屋里来的那个孩子吗？嗯？”</p>
<p>The doctor, usually such a friendly man, seemed so angry that the servants stared at him, open-mouthed. The doctor gave the m no time to think, and went on fiercely,</p>
<p>这位医生以往都是非常和气友好的，可这会儿竟是如此地愤怒，使得这些仆人目瞪口呆。医生不给他们考虑的时间，就又发怒说：</p>
<p>‘Three men see a boy for about a second in the dark, in the middle of a lot of smoke and noise. A boy comes to the same house the next day and because one arm is injured, They think he must be the robber. Are you going to swear that this is the same boy? Well? What do you say? ' he finished impatiently.</p>
<p>“三个人在黑暗中，在烟雾和嘈杂声中只看了孩子一眼，然而，第二天有一个孩子来到了这所房子，只因为他胳膊受了伤，这几个人居然就认为他就是那个盗贼。你们敢保证他就是那个孩子吗？嗯？你们有什么可说的？”他不耐烦地说完了。</p>
<p>The servants looked at each other in great confusion. Suddenly the re was a ring at the gate; the police officers had finally arrived. Dr Losberne gave orders that plenty of beer should be served before the officers went up to see Oliver. He also made sure that the servants had a generous amount of beer, too.</p>
<p>三个仆人互相看着，莫名其妙，大惑不解。正在这时，门铃忽然响起，警官终于赶来了。罗斯伯恩医生吩咐，在警官上楼去看奥利弗之前，啤酒一定要管够；另外，他还安排好同样多的啤酒给仆人们喝。</p>
<p>When the Officers were finally allowed to see Oliver, Dr Losberne said, 'This is a boy who was shot this morning while walking on a farmer's property where he shouldn't have been. The servants saw him and immediately thought he must be the same boy from last night. But now They say They're sure it's not the same boy. '</p>
<p>警官最后被允许去见奥利弗时，医生说：“这个孩子今天上午被枪打伤了，是因为他在一个农场主的私人土地上走，他是不该到那儿去的。仆人们发现了，马上以为他就是昨天晚上的那个孩子，可现在他们肯定，他不是那个孩子。”</p>
<p>The servants were by now so confused by beer and excitement that They were not sure of anything at all． The robbers had certainly had a boy with the m, They said, but whether this boy was the same boy… well, it seemed very doubtful. The police, too, had drunk quite a lot of beer by now, and before long They were very willing to believe that Oliver was not the robber of the night before. They had their own ideas about who committed all the robberies in the area, and Oliver was unknown to the m.</p>
<p>这时几个仆人已经酒劲发作，稀里糊涂，又加上过度兴奋，什么也不能肯定。盗贼中肯定有一个孩子，他们说，但究竟是不是这个孩子……，那就搞不清了。警官也喝多了点，不一会儿，他们也很愿意相信奥利弗不是前一天晚上的盗贼。谁常在这一带作案，他们自己心里有数，可奥利弗对他们来说却很陌生。</p>
<p>At last the police left, and Oliver was allowed to recover in the kind care of Mrs May lie, Rose, and Dr Losberne. It was several weeks before he was well enough to get out of bed. But the n he quickly grew stronger, and every day told his rescuers how grateful he was. One thing, however, caused him unhappiness. He wanted to find Mr Brown low , the kind old man who had looked after him in London. 'Mr Brown low would be pleased to know how happy I am now, 'he said. So when Dr Losberne offered to take Oliver to London to see Mr Brown low , the boy was very pleased.</p>
<p>警察们终于离开了，奥利弗被允许留了下来，在梅利夫人、罗斯和医生的精心护理下恢复健康。他的病情好转到能离开床的地步用了好几周的时间，可从那以后他很快就健壮起来了，每天都跟他的救命恩人们说他是多么感恩戴德。可有一件事一直使他闷闷不乐。他想去找布朗洛先生，那个在伦敦照看过他的好心的老人。“布朗洛先生要是知道我现在多么幸福快乐，一定会高兴的。”他说。因此，当医生提出带奥利弗去伦敦看望布朗洛先生时，这孩子高兴极了。</p>
<p>They set out by coach one fine morning, and when They arrived in London, They went straight to Mr Brown low 's house. Oliver's heart beat with excitement as They stopped outside. But the house was empty. They were told by the people next door that Mr Brown low had moved to the West Indies six weeks before. Oliver was very disappointed; he had thought about Mr Brown low so much recently, and had always hoped to find him again. But now the kind old man had moved abroad, still believing Oliver was a lying thief, and he might hold this belief until the day he died.</p>
<p>在一个晴朗的早晨，他们坐着马车出发了，一到伦敦便直奔布朗洛先生的家。当马车停在大门外时，奥利弗由于兴奋心咚咚地跳着。然而房子是空的，没有一个人。隔壁的邻居告诉他们，布朗洛先生一家已在六个星期之前迁到西印度群岛去了。这使奥利弗异常失望，这些天来，他经常想到布朗洛先生，也一直盼望能再见到他。可现在这位好心的老人移居国外了，他仍然认为奥利弗是个说谎话的小偷；一直到死，他都有可能这么认为。</p>
<p>This was a bitter disappointment to Oliver, but his new friends were still as kind to him as ever. They left the house in Chertsey and moved to a quiet cottage it the country, taking Oliver with the m Spring came, and in the fresh air, away from the noise and smoke and trouble of the city, Oliver began a new life. He went for walks with Rose and Mrs May lie, or Rose read to him, and he worked hard at his lessons. He felt as if he had left behind forever the world of crime and hardship and poverty.</p>
<p>这件事使奥利弗非常痛苦失望，可他的新朋友们还是对他友好如初，他们带着奥利弗离开了切特赛的这幢房子，搬到了乡下一所安静的茅舍。春天来了，这里空气新鲜，远离闹市，远离烟雾和纷扰，奥利弗开始了一种新生活。他常常与罗斯和梅利夫人外出散步，有时罗斯读书给他听，他也努力地学习功课。他觉得自己好像永远把罪恶、艰辛和贫困的世界抛在背后了。</p><a href='10.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
