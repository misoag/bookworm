<p><b>10 乡下的一段日子 </b></p>
<p>The weeks slipped contentedly past, and spring turned into summer. Oliver was now a strong and healthy boy, and very fond of Rose and Mrs May lie as They were of him.</p>
<p>几星期的日子令人满意地过去了，春天已消逝，现在进入了炎炎夏日。奥利弗现在长得很健壮了，他非常喜欢罗斯和梅利夫人——她们也同样喜欢他。</p>
<p>One hot summer evening, after a walk in the country, Rose became very weak and pale, and confessed she felt ill. By the next morning she was in a dangerous fever, and Mrs May lie and Oliver were afraid she might die. Mrs May lie sent Oliver to the nearest town, four miles away, to post two express letters. One was to Dr Losberne in Chertsey, the other to Harry May lie, Mrs May lie's son.</p>
<p>盛夏一个酷热的夜晚，刚从外面散步回来，罗斯突然手脚发软，脸色苍白，她承认自己病了。到了第二天早晨，她仍高烧不退，梅利夫人和奥利弗担心她会死去。梅利夫人让奥利弗到四英里以外离这儿最近的一个镇子上去发两封快信。一封是发给切特赛的罗斯伯恩医生的，另一封是给梅利夫人的儿子哈里&middot;梅利的。</p>
<p>Oliver, filled with anxiety, ran as fast as he could along the country roads and across the fields until, hot and exhausted, he reached the town. He posted the letters and turned to hurry home again. As he was running past a pub in the main street, he accidentally bumped into a tall man in black coming out. The man stared at Oliver. 'What the devil's this? ' he said, stepping back.</p>
<p>奥利弗忧心忡忡，尽可能快地跑过一条条乡间道路和一片片田地，等赶到了镇子上，他已是热气腾腾，精疲力竭。他发了信，就转身一刻不停地往回赶。他匆匆跑过镇子中心街道上的一家酒馆门前时，与从酒馆里出来的一个穿着一身黑的大汉撞了个满怀。这人盯着奥利弗，一边往后退一边说：“见鬼！怎么搞的？”</p>
<p>'I'm sorry, sir. I was in a hurry, and didn' t see you. '</p>
<p>“对不起，先生，我走得急，没看见您。”</p>
<p>The man murmured angrily to himself, 'Who would have thought it? Curse him! I can't get away from him! '</p>
<p>那人恼怒地自言自语着：“谁料到竟然会是他？该死的！我总也躲不开他。”</p>
<p>'I'm sorry, sir, repeated Oliver, frightened by the man' s wild, staring eyes.</p>
<p>“对不起，先生。”奥利弗被对方那死死盯住他的凶狠的眼睛吓坏了，又说了一句。</p>
<p>'The devil break your bones! 'the man said through his teeth. 'What are you doing here? He raised his hand and started towards Oliver with a mad look in his eyes, but fell violently to the ground, shaking and gasping, in a fit. People hurried up and helped the man into the pub while Oliver, thinking that the man was mad, ran quickly home/</p>
<p>“让魔鬼打断你的骨头！”那人从牙缝里挤出了一句话，“你在这儿干什么？”他说着，高高举起一只大手向奥利弗走过去，眼睛里流露出疯狂的目光，但又突然急病发作，摔在了地上，颤抖着，喘着粗气。周围的人赶紧把他搀起来扶进了酒馆；奥利弗以为他是个疯子，就急忙跑回家了。</p>
<p>Mrs May lie and Oliver passed a sleepless night, and Rose grew steadily worse as the fever burned in her．Oliver said every prayer he had ever learnt ten times over.</p>
<p>梅利夫人和奥利弗一夜没睡，罗斯的病情继续恶化，高烧不止。奥利弗不停地替她祈祷，一连十几遍地念着他所知道的各种祷文。</p>
<p>Late the next day Dr Losberne and Harry May lie arrived, and the house was full of worried faces and anxious whispers. But the danger passed, and by the next night Dr Losberne was able to announce that, though seriously ill, Rose would not die. Oliver cried for joy.</p>
<p>第二天晚些时候，罗斯伯恩医生和哈里&middot;梅利都赶来了。家里每个人都是满脸的焦急、忧虑，低声说着话。但危险终于过去了，到了第二天的晚上，医生终于得以宣布，罗斯虽然病得很厉害，但已脱离了生命危险。奥利弗高兴得流出了眼泪。</p>
<p>A day or two later, Mrs May lie talked privately to her son. Harry was a hand some young man of about twenty-five, with a cheerful, honest face and friendly manners He was clearly very fond of Rose.</p>
<p>一两天后，梅利夫人和儿子单独进行了一次谈话，哈里大约二十五岁，年轻英俊，一脸的和气诚实，待人非常友好。很明显，他是非常喜欢罗斯的。</p>
<p>'I know that you want to marry Rose， Mrs May lie told her son, 'and she is the nicest person I know But I want you to remember one thing－her birth. '</p>
<p>“我知道你想娶罗斯做你的妻子，”梅利夫人跟儿子说，“她也是我所遇到的最好的女孩，可有一件事你别忘了——她的出生。”</p>
<p>'Mother, that means nothing to me, 'said The young man. 'I love her. '</p>
<p>“母亲，我不在乎这些。”年轻人说。“我爱她。”</p>
<p>'I know you do, Harry, but she herself is well aware of her doubtful birth, and this might affect her answer if you ask her to marry you． I know you have ambitions to enter politics. If you marry a woman with a stain on her name, even though it's not her fault, it might spoil your chances of success in life. Society is cruel, Harry. People might use the knowledge of your wife's doubtful birth against you， and against your children, too. And one day, you might begin to regret your marriage. '</p>
<p>“我懂你的心思，哈里，可她自己很清楚她身世可疑，如果你向她求婚，这件事可能影响到她的答覆。我也知道你有心要进入政界，如果你娶了一个姓氏上有污点的女人做妻子，哪怕这并不是她自己的过错，此事也可能会破坏你出人头地的机会。社会是残酷的，哈里。人们会用你妻子不明不白的出生来攻击你以及你的子女。有一天，你可能要为这桩婚事后悔的。”</p>
<p>'Only a selfish man would do that, Mother! 'Harry answered impatiently. 'No, I am quite determined. I have loved Rose for a long time, and nothing will ever change that. '</p>
<p>“母亲，只有自私的人才会这么做！”哈里不耐烦地说，“不，我决心已定，我爱慕罗斯已久，这是任何事都改变不了的。”</p>
<p>Mrs May lie sighed. 'And she, I know, is very fond of you. But she herself may try to protect you, and refuse an offer of marriage frpm you, for your sake. Remember that, Harry. But now, I must go back and sit with her. '</p>
<p>梅利夫人叹了口气。“她，我知道，也是非常爱你的，可她自己可能想要保护你，为了你她会拒绝你的求婚的。记着这一点，哈里。我现在必须去陪她一会儿了。”</p>
<p>'Will you tell her how much I've worried about her? ' asked Harry. 'And how anxious I am to see her again?</p>
<p>“请您告诉她，我非常为她的健康担心。”哈里说，“还请告诉她，我迫切想再见到她，好吗？”</p>
<p>'Of course I will, 'replied Mrs May lie.</p>
<p>“我当然会的。”梅利夫人回答说。</p>
<p>Some days after this conversation, Oliver was sitting in the room where he studied in the evenings. It was a warm night, and he had been studying hard for some hours. He fell asleep at his desk and started dreaming. He dreamt that he was in Fagin's house again, and could see the old man sitting in his corner, whispering to another man. Yes, my dear, he heard Fagin say, 'you're right. That's him. '</p>
<p>在那次谈话几天之后的一个晚上，奥利弗又像往常那样坐在那间屋子里学习。那天晚上很燠热，他认真地学了好几个小时，便坐在桌前犯起困来了，迷迷糊糊地做了个梦。他梦见他又回到了费金的家，看见那个老家伙坐在屋子的角落里，跟另一个人小声地嘀咕着什么。“没错，亲爱的，”他听见费金说，“你说对了，那就是他。”</p>
<p>In Oliver's dream the other man answered. 'Of course it is! I told you I'd seen him. I'd recognize him anywhere. If I walked across his unmarked grave, I'd know it was him buried under the ground. '</p>
<p>奥利弗在梦中听见另一个人回答说：“绝对是他！我跟你说过我看见他了。无论他到了哪儿我都能认出他来；他就是死了，埋进了土里，坟上没有标志，我从坟上走过，也能认出下面埋的是他。”</p>
<p>He said this with such hatred that Oliver woke up from fear. In front of him, at the open window, so near he could almost touch the m, were Fagin and the strange, wild man he had bumped into outside the pub in the town. In a flash, They were gone. Oliver sat still, white with terror, for a second, the n shouted loudly for help.</p>
<p>他这话说得凶狠无比，把奥利弗给吓醒了。就在他的眼前，打开着的窗口外，他一伸手便能摸着的地方，站着费金和那个奇怪的、和奥利弗在镇子上的酒馆前撞了个满怀的疯子。突然，他们又不见了。奥利弗霎时间吓得脸色惨白，坐在那儿动弹不了，然后，他猛地高声喊着救命。</p>
<p>Harry and Dr Losberne came running, and hearing what had happened, They rushed outside into the night and searched the garden and the fields around. The re was no sign of anybody.</p>
<p>哈里和罗斯伯恩医生闻声赶来，问清了是怎么回事后，就冲进了夜色中，在屋子花园和周围的田地里来回搜寻，但没发现什么人。</p>
<p>'It must have been a bad dream, Oliver, ' said Harry, breathless after running through the fields. He had heard all about Oliver's past from his mother.</p>
<p>“奥利弗，你一定是做了个噩梦！”哈里在田地里跑了一大圈回来，上气不接下气地说。他从母亲那里得知了奥利弗的全部经历。</p>
<p>'No, 'replied Oliver, still frightened. 'I saw the m both as plainly as I see you now. '</p>
<p>“不是。”奥利弗仍害怕地说。“我清清楚楚地看见了他们俩，就像现在看见你站在这儿一样。”</p>
<p>Nothing more was seen or heard of the two men, and after a few days, the event was forgotten. Rose recovered rapidly and was soon able to go outside again. Harry May lie waited a few days, the n, as his mother had expected, he asked Rose to marry him. And as his mother had warned him, Rose refused.</p>
<p>此后没有人再发现这两个人，几天过去，这件事就被人们忘记了。罗斯恢复得很快，不久又像以前一样能够出来活动了。哈里&middot;梅利又等待了几日，之后，正如他母亲预料的那样，他请求罗斯小姐嫁给他。也正像他母亲提醒过的那样，他遭到了罗斯的拒绝。</p>
<p>'Don't you love me? ' he asked her, holding her hand .</p>
<p>“难道是你不爱我吗？”他拉着她的手说。</p>
<p>'I do, 'she whispered, ' but please try to forget me. It would ruin your future as a politician if anybody found out about my birth. I could never, never forgive myself. '</p>
<p>“我是真心地爱你，”她低语着，“但请你设法忘掉我。一旦有人知道了我不明不白的出生，这将会断送你作为一个政治家的前途。这将会使我永远、永远无法饶恕自己。”</p>
<p>Harry paused for a few minutes. 'Tell me one thing, dear Rose. Could you have accepted if your past had been different? Or if I had been poor and friendless, with no hope of riches or success? '</p>
<p>哈里半天沉默不语。“亲爱的罗斯，告诉我一件事，假如你的过去不是这样，假如我是个贫穷的没有朋友的人，没有希望会变得富有，也没有希望会成功，那你会答应我的请求吗？”</p>
<p>'I could, 'answered Rose, covering her face to hide her tears. 'But as you are, I can never be more than a friend to you.</p>
<p>“我会的。”罗斯蒙住脸，掩盖着流出的泪水，说：“但像你目前这种情况，我最多只能做你的朋友。”</p>
<p>'I shall ask you once more, said Harry softly. 'In a year's time or less, I shall ask you to change your mind. '</p>
<p>“我会再向你求婚的，”哈里含情脉脉地说，“只需一年的时间，或者用不了一年，我会求你改变主意的。”</p>
<p>The girl shook her head and smiled sadly. 'No, it will be useless. '</p>
<p>女孩摇着头，伤感地微笑着说：“不会的，一切都将无济于事。”</p>
<p>Harry left the next day, having asked Oliver to write to him secretly with news of his mother and Rose. From an upstairs window, Rose watched him leave with tears in her eyes.</p>
<p>第二天哈里便离开了家，他背地里嘱咐奥利弗给他写信，告知关于母亲和罗斯的情况。罗斯站在楼上的窗前，泪水涟涟地目送着哈里离去。</p>
<p>Mr Bumble was now a married man, and not a happy one. He was no longer a beadle but the manager of the workhouse, and his wife, formerly Mrs Corney, scolded and argued with him day and night. One evening, after a particularly violent fight, when she threw things at him and chased him out of the house, he went for a walk alone through the town. He felt very sorry for himself, and finally went into a pub to find comfort in gin－and－water. A tall dark man, sitting in the corner, watched Mr Bumble while he drank. The stranger's clothe s were dusty and muddy, as if he had travelled a long way. Mr Bumble began to feel uncomfortable at the man's hard stare, and tried to avoid meeting his eyes.</p>
<p>班布尔先生现在是个结了婚的人了，可他并不是个幸福的人。他已升为济贫院的院长，不再是以前的那个执事了。他的妻子，以前的科尼太太，整天同他吵吵闹闹，骂骂咧咧。一天晚上，刚刚结束了一场特别激烈的争斗（她朝他身上扔东西，把他赶出了家门），他沿着镇子的街道朝前走着。他自怜自怨，终于进了一家小酒馆，要了一点加了水的杜松子酒，借酒浇愁。一个黝黑的高个子男人坐在酒馆的一角，瞧着喝酒的班布尔先生。这个陌生人穿着一身沾满了泥土的衣服，好像刚从很远的地方来到这儿。班布尔先生被他盯得有点不自在，尽量躲避着他的目光。</p>
<p>'I've seen you before, 'the stranger said, eventually. 'you were the beadle here. '</p>
<p>“我以前见过你。”这个陌生的人最终说。“你那时是这儿的执事。”</p>
<p>'I was. But I don't recognize you. '</p>
<p>“是的，可我怎么也想不起您来了。”</p>
<p>'It doesn't matter. I came here to look for you, and I'm lucky to have found you. I'd like some information. ' He pushed a couple of coins across the table.</p>
<p>“这不要紧，我到这儿就是来找你的，很幸运，竟然碰到了你。我想从你这儿打听点事。”他从桌子的另一头推过来几个硬币。</p>
<p>'What information? ' asked Mr Bumble suspiciously, slipping the coins into his pocket.</p>
<p>“您想知道什么？”班布尔先生疑心重重地问，并一下子将那几个硬币放进了衣袋。</p>
<p>'About a workhouse birth. A boy called Oliver Twist. '</p>
<p>“关于一个出生在济贫院，叫奥利弗&middot;特威斯特的男孩。”</p>
<p>'Young Twist! I remember him! He was a dreadful—'</p>
<p>“小特威斯特，我知道他，他是个非常讨厌的——”</p>
<p>'It's not him I want to talk about, interrupted the stranger. 'I've heard enough of him. It's the old woman who was the nurse for his mother. Where is she? '</p>
<p>“我要知道的不是关于他的事，”陌生人打断了他的话，“他的事我全都听烦了，我想知道的是看护过他妈妈的那个老女人，她现在在什么地方？”</p>
<p>'Oh- she died last winter, 'said Mr Bumble. The n he remembered that his wife had been the re when old Sally had died, and he realized that this information might be worth something. He told the man that one woman had been with the nurse when she died, and had heard some secret from her.</p>
<p>“噢，她去年冬天就死了。”班布尔先生说。他突然想起，老萨莉死的时候，他妻子就在常他意识到这一条消息可能值几个钱，就跟那个人说，老看护死的时候有一个女人在身边，并从她那里知道了一些秘密。</p>
<p>'Where can I find this woman? the stranger asked quickly, showing in his pale face how important this was to him.</p>
<p>“我怎么才能找到这个女人？”陌生人急切地问，他那苍白的面色显示出这事对他有多么重要。</p>
<p>'I can bring her to meet you tomorrow, 'said Mr Bumble.</p>
<p>“我明天可以把她带到这儿来见您。”班布尔先生说。</p>
<p>'All right Down by the river, at nine in the evening. ' The man wrote the address on a piece of paper.</p>
<p>“太好了，那就在下面的河岸上，晚上九点整。”那人将地址写在了一张纸头上。</p>
<p>'And your name? asked Mr Bumble.</p>
<p>“您叫什么名字？”班布尔先生问。</p>
<p>'Monks, replied the stranger, 'but you don't need to remember it. 'The n he quickly left the pub.</p>
<p>“蒙克斯。”陌生人回答道，“但是你不必记住这个。”然后他便急匆匆地离开了酒馆。</p>
<p>The next evening was dark and cloudy; a storm threatened and already the first drops of rain were falling. Mr and Mrs Bumble walked up the main street of the town, the n turned towards a group of ruined old houses next to the river. Mr Bumble went first, carrying a dim light, and his wife followed closely behind. At the oldest and most ruined building, They stopped and Mr Bumble took out his piece of paper. The first distant crash of thunder shook the air, and the rain began to pour down heavily. The n They heard Monks calling out of an upstairs window.</p>
<p>第二天的夜晚又黑又阴沉，天上开始掉着雨点，一场大雨就要来临了。班布尔夫妇沿着镇子的主要街道走着，然后拐弯朝着河边一些破败的旧屋子走去。班布尔先生手里提着一盏昏暗的灯走在前头，他的妻子紧跟在身后。他们在一幢最古老和最破旧的楼前停了下来，班布尔先生拿出了他记地址的纸条。第一声惊雷在远处空中炸响，随后大雨倾盆而下。这时他们听见蒙克斯从楼上的一个窗口叫了一声。</p>
<p>'Is that the man? ' Mrs Bumble asked her husband.</p>
<p>“是那个人吗？”班布尔太太问自己的丈夫。</p>
<p>'Yes. '</p>
<p>“是他。”</p>
<p>'The n be careful to say as little as you can. Don't tell him I'm your wife. '</p>
<p>“那你就尽量少说话，别跟他说我是你妻子。”</p>
<p>Monks opened a small door, saying impatiently, 'Come in! Don't keep me waiting! '</p>
<p>蒙克斯打开一扇小门，不耐烦地说：“快进来！别让我再等了！”</p>
<p>Mr Bumble was only brave when dealing with poor, helpless people. He felt very uneasy about entering this dark building with an ill－tempered stranger. However, he was equally afraid of his wife. Nervously, he followed her through the door.</p>
<p>班布尔先生只有在对付穷人和孤苦无援的人时才是勇敢的，要同这个脾气暴躁的陌生人一起走进黑洞洞的楼里，他感到十分胆怯。但他也同样怕他的妻子。他紧张地跟着她进了门。</p>
<p>Inside, Monks stared at Mrs Bumble for some time. 'So this is the woman, is it? '</p>
<p>到了屋里，蒙克斯盯着班布尔太太看了片刻。“她就是那个女人吗？”</p>
<p>'Yes, 'replied Mr Bumble cautiously.</p>
<p>“是她。”班布尔先生十分小心地回答。</p>
<p>As They walked upstairs, the re was a bright flash of lightning outside, followed by loud thunder. They sat dowu at the table and Monks started immediately.</p>
<p>他们上楼时，外面忽然打了一下闪电，接着马上是一阵雷鸣。他们在一张桌子旁坐下，蒙克斯迫不急待地开始讲话。</p>
<p>'So you were present when the old woman died, is that right? And she told you something? He stared at Mrs Bumble again.</p>
<p>“那个老女人死的时候你在场，是吗？她跟你说了些什么？”他又紧盯着班布尔太太。</p>
<p>'Yes, 'said Mrs Bumble. 'Something about the mother of Oliver Twist. But first, how much will you pay me for the information? '</p>
<p>“是的，”班布尔太太说，“一些关于奥利弗&middot;特威斯特的母亲的事。但是，您首先要告诉我，知道这些情况您会给我多少钱？”</p>
<p>'If it's what I want to hear-twenty－five pounds, 'said Monks. 'But it's a lot of money for something which has been lying dead for twelve years. 'Reluctantly, he pushed the money across the table towards her, the n bent forward to listen. The faces of the three nearly touched, as the two men leant over the table to hear what the woman had to say, and the woman leant over towards the m so that They could hear her whisper. In the dim lamplight their faces looked pale and ghostly.</p>
<p>“假如是我想要知道的事，我会给你二十五英镑，”蒙克斯说。“对于一个沉睡了十二年的消息，这些钱不算少了。”说着，他不情愿地将桌子上的钱朝她面前推了过去，然后俯身向前去听。三个人的脸几乎凑在了一起，两个男人俯在桌子上方凑向这女人，听她说些什么，她也朝他们靠了过去，好让他们能听见她小声说话。在昏暗的灯影下，他们的脸苍白得像幽灵一样。</p>
<p>'The old woman who was the nurse died with only me in the room, 'said Mrs Bumble.</p>
<p>“那个当看护的老女人死的时候只有我在她的房间里。”班布尔太太说。</p>
<p>'No one else was the re? ' asked Monks fiercely.</p>
<p>“还有别人在场吗？”蒙克斯恶狠狠地问。</p>
<p>'No one. '</p>
<p>“没有。”</p>
<p>'Good, 'said Monks. 'Go on. '</p>
<p>“太好了，”蒙克斯说，“接着说。”</p>
<p>'She spoke about a young woman who had given birth in the same bed some years before. The child was Oliver Twist. And this nurse had robbed the child's mother. '</p>
<p>“她说的是多年前一个年轻的女人就在她躺的那张床上生下了一个孩子。这孩子就是奥利弗&middot;特威斯特。这个老看护偷了他妈妈的一样东西。”</p>
<p>'Robbed in life? ' asked Monks.</p>
<p>“是在她死之前拿的吗？”蒙克斯问。</p>
<p>'In death. She stole from the body when it was hardly cold. But the old woman fell back and died before she could tell memore．’</p>
<p>“是在她断气之后，尸骨还没有寒冷的时候。没跟我说上几句话，老萨莉便倒下死了。”</p>
<p>‘It’s a lie！’shouted Monks furiously． ‘You know more！I’ll kill you both if you don’t tell me what else she said．’</p>
<p>“撒谎！”蒙克斯恼怒万分地叫嚷着，“你肯定还知道更多的事！如果你不把她的话全说出来，我会宰了你们俩的。”</p>
<p>‘She said no more，’repeated Mrs Bumble calmly，showing（unlike Mr Bumble）no fear of the strange man’s violence． ‘But in her hand I found a piece of dirty paper．’</p>
<p>“她没能说更多的话。”班布尔太太冷静地说。她（不像班布尔先生）没有显露出一点害怕这个陌生人的暴虐的样子。“可我在她手里发现了一张肮脏的破纸头。”</p>
<p>‘Which contained…？’</p>
<p>“里面有……？”</p>
<p>‘Nothing．It was only a receipt from a pawnbroker．I went to the pawnbroker and got back a little gold locket．Inside was a gold wedding ring and on the locket itself，the name“Agnes”．’She put the locket on the table in front of Monks．</p>
<p>“什么都没有，是一家当铺的收条。我找到了这家当铺，赎回的是一个挂在项链上面的小金盒子，里面放着一枚金的结婚戒指，金盒子上写的人名是 ‘阿格尼丝’。”她把小金盒子放在了桌子上蒙克斯的面前。</p>
<p>He picked it up immediately and looked at it closely，his hand s shaking． ‘Is this all？’</p>
<p>他一把抓起小盒子，放在眼前仔细地看着，两只手不停地颤抖。“只有这些吗？”</p>
<p>‘It is．And now I want to ask you a question．What do youintend to do with the locket？’</p>
<p>“就这些。现在我想问您一句，您打算把这盒子怎么办？”</p>
<p>‘This．So it can never be used against me．’Monks suddenly pushed the table to one side and opened a small door in the floor．Down below rushed the river，its muddy waters swollen by the heavy rain．</p>
<p>“这么办！这样谁也不能用它来找我的麻烦了。”蒙克斯猛地把桌子推到了一边，打开了地板上的一个暗门，下面是汹涌的河水。由于大雨，泥浆般的河水涨了起来。</p>
<p>‘If you threw a man’s body down the re，where would it be to morrow？’asked Monks．</p>
<p>“假如把一个人的尸体从这儿扔下去，明天他会到了什么地方？”蒙克斯问。</p>
<p>‘Twelve miles down the river，and cut to pieces，’replied Mr Bumble in a shaky voice．</p>
<p>班布尔先生用发抖的声音说；“十二英里以外，裂成了碎片。”</p>
<p>Monks tied the locket to a heavy weight and dropped it in to the water．In a second，it was gone．The three of the m lookedinto each other’s faces，and seemed to breathe more freely．</p>
<p>蒙克斯将金盒子系在了一个很重的东西上，把它扔进了水里。它刹那间就消失了。三个人互相看着，喘出的气好像都轻松了许多。</p>
<p>‘Now we have nothing more to say，’said Monks，with athreatening look at Mr Bumble． ‘And nothing to say to any one else either．Do you understand？’</p>
<p>“现在我们没有更多要说的话了，”蒙克斯威胁地看着班布尔先生说。“别跟任何人说起这件事，明白吗？”</p>
<p>‘Certainly，’said Mr Bumble，very politely．He move da way from the strange man，anxious to leave quickly．</p>
<p>“当然了。”班布尔先生有礼貌地说。他离开这个陌生的人远一点，急于尽快走开。</p>
<p>At the door to the street，Monks turned again to Mr Bumble． ‘And if we ever meet again，we don’t know each other．Do you understand that as well？’</p>
<p>在临街的门口处，蒙克斯又转向班布尔先生说：“如果我们以后再碰到，谁也不认识谁。你明白吗？”</p>
<p>‘Perfectly，’said the relieved Mr Bumble，moving away into the rain and pulling his wife with him．</p>
<p>“那是绝对的，”班布尔先生如释重负地说道，然后拉着妻子走进了大雨里。</p><a href='11.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
