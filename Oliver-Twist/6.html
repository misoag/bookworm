<p><b>6 奥利弗又被找到了 </b></p>
<p>Oliver began to recover and slowly regain his strength. The picture that had caused Mr Brown low 's excitement was taken down from the wall, and was not mentioned again. Oliver was disappointed at the disappearance of the picture, since he liked the woman's face, but he had many other things to think about now.</p>
<p>奥利弗慢慢地恢复了，气力也恢复了。那幅挂在墙上使布朗洛先生激动不已的画像被拿了下来，也不再被任何人提起了。画像的消失使奥利弗很失望，因为他很喜欢照片上女人的面貌，不过，现在他有许多别的事要想。</p>
<p>They were happy days, while Oliver was getting better. He played cards with Mrs Bed win and listened to stories about her family. The days were all so quiet and relaxing, after the hardships and poverty of his previous life. Mr Brown low bought him a new suit and new shoes, and Oliver's dirty old clothe s were given away.</p>
<p>奥利弗渐渐恢复的这些日子是非常幸福的，他与贝德温太太一起打牌，听她讲一些她们家里的故事。经受了以前那些备尝穷困与艰辛的日子后，现在的日子是如此平静、愉快。布朗洛先生给奥利弗买了一套新衣服和一双新鞋子，他以前的破烂衣服都送掉了。</p>
<p>One day Mr Brown low asked him to come to his study for a little talk.</p>
<p>一天，布朗洛让他到书房来，想跟他说点事。</p>
<p>Oliver went in and sat down. He looked at Mr Brown low 's serious face in alarm. 'Don't tell me you're going to send me away, sir, please! 'he exclaimed. 'Let me stay here! I could help with the housework…please, sir! '</p>
<p>奥利弗走进书房坐定，他看看布朗洛满脸的严肃劲，惊慌起来。“先生，请别把我送走！”他惊叫着。“让我留在这儿！我能帮着干家务活……先生，求求您了！”</p>
<p>'My dear child, don't be afraid, 'said Mr Brown low kindly. 'I won't desert you. I believe that you're a good boy, not a common thief. You told me you're an orphan—that seems to be the truth. But I want to hear now the whole story of your life, and how you came to be with the boys I saw you with that day. '</p>
<p>“亲爱的孩子，别害怕，”布朗洛先生和蔼地说，“我不会抛弃你的。我相信你是个好孩子，不是个下贱的小偷。你跟我说过你是个孤儿——看来这是真的。现在我想知道你全部的身世，还有，那天我看见你和那些孩子在一起，我想知道你是怎么和他们混到一块的。”</p>
<p>Oliver began his story but was soon interrupted by the arrival of Mr Grimwig, an old friend of Mr Brown low 's. Mr Grimwig was a fierce old gentleman and very fond of arguments. He clearly knew all about Oliver and inspected him closely.</p>
<p>奥利弗开始述说自己的故事，不一会儿，他就被格里姆威格先生的来访打断了。他是布朗洛先生的一位老朋友，这位老先生生性残忍，喜欢辩论。他清楚地知道奥利弗的一切情况，仔细地审视着他。</p>
<p>'So this is the boy, is it? 'he said at last.</p>
<p>“看来这就是那个孩子了，是吗？”他最后问道。</p>
<p>Oliver bowed politely and was introduced by Mr Brown low . Tea was the n brought in, and during the meal Mr Grimwig stared so hard at Oliver that the boy felt rather confused. Eventually, Mr Grimwig whispered to Mr Brown low , 'He may be a good-looking boy, but I think he's deceiving you, my good friend, '</p>
<p>奥利弗有礼貌地给他鞠了躬，并由布朗洛先生作了介绍。然后用人递上了茶点，喝茶时格里姆威格先生死死盯着奥利弗，使这孩子感到非常不自在。终于，格里姆威格先生凑近布朗洛先生，小声地说：“这孩子可能算是长相不错，但我想他是在欺骗你呢，我的好朋友。”</p>
<p>'Nonsense! 'said Mr Brown low , becoming angry.</p>
<p>“胡说八道！”布朗洛先生生气地说。</p>
<p>'Well, we'll see, answered his friend. 'We'll see. '</p>
<p>“好吧，我们走着瞧，”他的朋友说，“我们走着瞧。”</p>
<p>Later that afternoon Mr Brown low wanted to return some books to a bookseller, and to send some money for new books that he had already collected. Mr Grimwig suggested that Oliver should go. 'He'll be sure to deliver everything safely, 'he said with a smile.</p>
<p>那天下午稍晚一些时候，布朗洛先生要把几本书还给一位书商，另外带点钱为他已经拿回来的几本新书付款。格里姆威格先生建议让奥利弗去办这件事。他微笑着说：“他肯定会安全地把书和钱都送到的。”</p>
<p>'Yes, please let me take the m, 'said Oliver, delighted to be of use.</p>
<p>“是的，让我去吧。”奥利弗说道，他很高兴能被派上用常</p>
<p>Mr Brown low hesitated, but Mr Grimwig's smile had annoyed him. 'Very well, 'he said. 'Here are the books, Oliver, and a five-pound note. The bookseller will give you ten shillings change. '</p>
<p>布朗洛先生先是有点犹豫，可他被格里姆威格先生的那种微笑惹恼了。“好吧，”他说，“书在这儿，奥利弗，这是五个英镑，书商会找回十个先令的。”</p>
<p>'I won't be ten minutes, 'replied Oliver eagerly, and he ran out into the street.</p>
<p>“用不了十分钟我就能回来。”奥利弗急切地说，然后跑着出去，上了街。</p>
<p>'So you expect him to come back, do you? 'enquired Mr Grimwig.</p>
<p>“你还指望他能回来，是吗？”格里姆威格先生问道。</p>
<p>'Yes, I do, 'said Mr Brown low , smiling confidently. 'Don't you? '</p>
<p>“是的。”布朗洛先生非常自信地笑着说，“你不指望他回来吗？”</p>
<p>'No, He has a new suit of clothe s, some valuable books, and a five-pound note in his pocket. He'll join his old friends the thieves, and laugh at you. If he comes back, I'll eat my hat. '</p>
<p>“不，他穿着一身新衣服，带着一些价钱很贵的书，兜里装着五英镑的钞票。他会回到他那些老朋友那儿，回到那个贼窝去笑话你的。假如他回来了，我就把我的帽子给吃了。”</p>
<p>The two men sat by the window with a pocket-watch between the m, and waited for Oliver's return.</p>
<p>这两位先生靠窗户坐着，将一块怀表放在他们中间，等着奥利弗回来。</p>
<p>Oliver hurried through the streets to the book shop, thinking how lucky he was. Suddenly the re was a loud scream behind him. 'Oh, my dear brother! 'Before be could look round, a pair of arms was thrown tightly around his neck.</p>
<p>奥利弗急忙穿过街道，朝书店奔去，心想自己真幸运。忽听背后一声大叫：“啊，我亲爱的弟弟！”他还来不及朝后看一眼，就觉得有一双胳膊紧紧地搂在了他的脖子上。</p>
<p>'Don't! 'he cried, struggling. 'Let go! Why are you stopping me? Who is it? '</p>
<p>“别！”他挣扎着叫道，“放开！你干吗要挡住我，你是谁？”</p>
<p>The young woman holding him started to cry loudly. 'I've found him! Oh! Oliver! You naughty boy, to make me suffer so much! Come home immediately, you cruel boy! 'She burst into tears and several people stopped to stare at what was happening.</p>
<p>那年轻女人搂住他大声地叫着：“我找到他了！噢！奥利弗！你这个不听话的孩子，你让我多伤心啊！赶紧回家，你这个没良心的孩子！”她痛哭流涕，惹得几个行人停下脚步，看出了什么事。</p>
<p>'What's the matter? 'asked one of the watching women.</p>
<p>“出了什么事？”一个看热闹的妇人问道。</p>
<p>'He ran away from his parents a month ago, 'The young woman said. 'They're hard-working, respectable people, and he left the m to join a gang of thieves and bad characters, and almost broke his mother's heart. '</p>
<p>“一个月以前他从爸爸妈妈那里逃了出来，”那年轻女人说，“他父母可是任劳任怨、清白正派的人，他竟跑出来和一帮小偷、坏人混在一起，这简直使他妈伤心透了。”</p>
<p>'Go home, you horrible child, 'said another woman.</p>
<p>“回家去，你这个讨厌的孩子。”另一个女人说。</p>
<p>'Yes—go back to your parents, 'said a third.</p>
<p>“对，快回到你父母那儿去。”第三个人说。</p>
<p>'But I haven't got any! 'replied Oliver, greatly alarmed. 'I haven't got a sister, either. I'm an orphan. I live in Pentonville. '</p>
<p>“可我没有父亲，也没有母亲！”奥利弗非常惊恐地说，“更没有姐妹，我是个孤儿，我住在本顿维尔区。”</p>
<p>'Listen to him! Make him come home, 'The young woman said to the crowd, 'or he'll kill his dear mother and father, and break my heart. '</p>
<p>“你们听他说的！你们让他回家去，”年轻女人冲着人群说，“否则，他父母会为他死去的。我也会伤透了心。”</p>
<p>Suddenly Oliver recognized the woman he had seen in Fagin's house. 'It's Nancy! 'he said, without thinking.</p>
<p>突然，奥利弗认出了她就是在费金家见过的那个女人。“你是南希！”他不假思索地说。</p>
<p>'You see? 'cried Nancy to the crowd. 'He knows me! '</p>
<p>“你们看，”南希冲着人群大声说，“他认识我！”</p>
<p>Just the n a big man ran out of a beer shop, followed by a white dog. 'What's this? Young Oliver! Come home to your poor mother, you young devil! And what books are the se? You've stolen the m, haven't you? Give the m to me. 'The man, who was Bill Sikes, seized Oliver with one strong hand and hit him on the head with the other.</p>
<p>就在这时，一个大个子男人从一家啤酒馆里跑了出来，身后跟着一条白狗。“这是怎么了？小奥利弗！快回到你可怜的妈妈身边去，你这个小家伙！这些是什么书？是你偷来的吧？来，给我。”这人就是比尔&middot;赛克斯。他用一只粗壮有力的大手抓住奥利弗，用另一只手打他的脑袋。</p>
<p>'That'll do him good! 'shouted some of the crowd. 'It's the only way to treat boys like him. '</p>
<p>“这对他有好处！”人群里一些人说，“对待他这种男孩就得这样。”</p>
<p>Bill Sikes held onto Oliver's arm. 'Come on, you young thief! '</p>
<p>比尔&middot;赛克斯紧紧抓牢奥利弗的胳膊。“走，你这个小偷！”</p>
<p>Still weak from illness, and terrified by the growling dog, Oliver could not resist. He was taken through the dark narrow streets at great speed. Sikes and Nancy gave him no chance to escape and Oliver had no breath to call out for help. All too quickly, he was back in Fagin's house, where his old friends were waiting for him.</p>
<p>由于生过病，身体仍然很虚弱，奥利弗被这条狗的狂叫吓坏了，他坚持不住了。他被裹挟着很快地穿过了黑暗狭窄的街道。赛克斯和南希死死地抓住他，他无法逃走。奥利弗气喘吁吁，连救命都喊不出。转眼间，他又回到了费金的家，他的老朋友们都在这儿等着他呢。</p>
<p>'Delighted to see you looking so well, my dear, 'Fagin said, bowing politely. 'Why didn't you write, and say you were coming? We'd have got something warm for supper. '</p>
<p>“很高兴见到你这么好，亲爱的。”费金说，并很礼貌地鞠着躬。“你为什么不写信说你要回来了？那样我们会留下点热乎乎的晚饭给你的。”</p>
<p>The Dodger and Charley Bates roared with laughter, and the Dodger began looking through the books Oliver had with him.</p>
<p>神偷和查理&middot;贝茨狂笑着。神偷又开始翻奥利弗带着的书。</p>
<p>'Give the m back! 'Oliver cried. 'Those books belong to the kind old gentleman who took me into his home. Send him back the books and the money—he'll think I stole the m! '</p>
<p>“还给我！”奥利弗说，“这些书是那个带我去他家的好心的老先生的。书和钱得给他送回去——否则他会认为是我偷走了他的书和钱。”</p>
<p>'You're right, 'laughed Fagin. 'He will think that! '</p>
<p>“你说的对，”费金笑着说，“他会这么认为的！”</p>
<p>Oliver jumped to his feet and ran wildly from the room, shouting for help. The Dodger and Fagin caught him easily, and brought him back. The n the old man picked up a long piece of wood.</p>
<p>奥利弗一跃而起，疯狂地从屋里往外跑去，喊着救命。神偷和费金毫不费力就将他抓了回来，这时，这老头拿起一根长木头。</p>
<p>'So you wanted to get away, my dear, did you? Wanted to call the police and get help? We'll cure you of that. '</p>
<p>“这么说你想离开这儿，是吗，亲爱的？想叫警察来救你？我们先来治治你。”</p>
<p>He hit Oliver hard on the shoulders with the stick. He was raising it for a second hit when Nancy rushed forward and, seizing the piece of wood, threw it into the fire.</p>
<p>他用木棒使劲地打奥利弗的肩膀，当他再次举起手里的木棒时，南希扑了过去，夺下了木棒，扔进了炉火。</p>
<p>'I won't let you do it, Fagin! 'she shouted. 'You've got him again. Isn't that enough? Now leave him alone. '</p>
<p>“我不许你这样对待他，费金！”她嚷嚷着，“你把他弄回来了，还不够吗？现在别折磨他了。”</p>
<p>Fagin and Sikes looked at each other, shocked by her reaction.</p>
<p>费金和赛克斯互相看了一眼，他们被她的举动惊住了。</p>
<p>'You'd better keep quiet, my girl, 'growled Sikes.</p>
<p>“你最好别嚷嚷，姑娘。”赛克斯咆哮着。</p>
<p>'No, I won't! ' cried the girl wildly. 'Now you've got the boy, you'll turn him into a thief and a liar. Isn't that enough, without killing him too? '</p>
<p>“不，我要嚷嚷！”这女孩发狂般地叫着，“你们现在弄到这孩子了，你们要把他变成一个贼，一个骗子，这还不够吗？难道还要弄死他吗？”</p>
<p>She rushed at Fagin and would have hit him if Sikes had not held her arms so tightly that she couldn't move. She struggled wildly for a while, the n, exhausted, she fainted. Sikes laid her down in the corner, as surprised as Fagin at her anger.</p>
<p>她扑向费金，如果不是赛克斯抓住了她的胳膊，使她动不了的话，她会跟他撕打一番的。她拼命地挣扎了一会儿，然后没了力气，晕倒了。赛克斯让她躺在墙角处，和费金一样，他对她的发怒感到惊讶。</p>
<p>'She can be really wild when she's angry, 'Sikes said.</p>
<p>“她发起脾气来可真够疯的。”赛克斯说。</p>
<p>Fagin wiped his forehead. 'That's the trouble with women, 'he said, 'but she's a clever girl in her work. '</p>
<p>费金擦着额头。“女人就这一点麻烦。”他说，“可她干起活来倒挺麻利的。”</p>
<p>The n Charley Bates and the Dodger took away Oliver's expensive new suit, gave him some old clothe s, and locked him up in a dark room. Oliver felt tired and ill, and was soon fast asleep.</p>
<p>然后，查理&middot;贝茨和神偷拿走了奥利弗的新衣服，给他扔了几件旧衣服，把他锁进了一间黑屋子。奥利弗觉得又累又难受，没多一会儿就沉沉地睡着了。</p><a href='7.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
