<p><b>4 奥利弗在伦敦 </b></p>
<p>For some reason the Dodger did not want to enter London during daylight，so it was nearly eleven o’clock at night when They got near the centre. Oliver had never seen a dirtier or more miserable place. The streets in this district were narrow and muddy， and the re were terrible smells everywhere. Children wandered around even at this time of night，in and out of the many shops，playing and screaming．The pubs were full of people fighting，and big，evil－looking men stood in doorways or at dark corners． Oliver almost wanted to run away， but just the n the Dodger pushed open a door and pulled Oliver into a dark hall.</p>
<p>由于某些原因，插翅神偷不愿意在白天进伦敦，所以，他们到达市中心时，已经差不多是晚上11时了。奥利弗从未见过这么龌龊、悲惨的地方。这个地区的街道狭窄泥泞，到处散发着熏人的臭气。临近半夜了，孩子们还在街头游逛着，在街头的许多小铺子里进进出出，玩闹、尖叫着。小酒馆里挤满了打架的人。凶神恶煞般的大块头站在门口外黑暗的角落里。奥利弗差点儿被吓跑了。就在这时，神偷推开一扇门，将奥利弗拽到一个昏暗的门厅里。</p>
<p>‘Who’s the re？’ a voice cried out．</p>
<p>“是谁啊？”一个声音唤道。</p>
<p>‘It’s me，’ said the Dodger． The faint light of a candle appeared in the hall．</p>
<p>“是我。”神偷说。门厅里出现了一丝微弱的蜡烛的光亮。</p>
<p>‘Who’s the other one？’</p>
<p>“另一个是谁呀？”</p>
<p>‘A new friend. ‘</p>
<p>“一位新朋友。”</p>
<p>They went up some dark and broken stairs．Oliver could hardly see where he was going，but the Dodger seemed to know the way， and helped Oliver up. They entered a room with walls that were black with age and dirt．In front of the fire was a table with a candle stuck into a bottle of beer， and an old man， with a horribly ugly face and red hair， stood next to the fire cooking. He was wearing a dirty old coat and seemed to divide his attention between his cooking and a number of silk handkerchieves， which were hanging near the fire．The re were several rough beds in the room．Four or five boys， about the same age as the Artful Dodger， sat round the table， smoking and drinking like middle-aged men．They all looked up when the Dodger and Oliver entered．</p>
<p>他们踩着漆黑、破烂的楼梯走上去，奥利弗几乎什么也看不见，全靠神偷扶着他往前走，而神偷显得对这儿挺熟的。他们走进了一间屋子，由于年代已久，屋子的墙又黑又脏。炉前的桌子上放了一瓶啤酒，瓶口插着一节蜡烛。一位长着非常丑恶的脸和红头发的老人站在火炉旁煮饭。他穿了一件破旧、肮脏的大衣，好像一边煮着饭一边注意着挂在炉旁边的几条丝手帕。屋里摆着几张简陋的床。四五个与插翅神偷年龄差不多的男孩围坐在桌子旁，像中年人一样嘴里叼着烟，喝着酒。神偷和奥利弗走进来时，他们都抬起头来看着。</p>
<p>‘This is him，Fagin，’ the Dodger said to the old man． ‘My friend Oliver Twist．’</p>
<p>“这就是他，费金。”神偷跟老头说。“我的朋友奥利弗&middot;特威斯特。”</p>
<p>Fagin smiled and shook Oliver’s hand．The n all The young gentlemen came up to him and shook both his hands very hard， especially the hand which held his few possessions. One of the boys was particularly kind．He even put his hands in Oliver’s pockets so that Oliver would not have to empty the m himself when he went to bed．The boys would probably have been even more helpful， but Fagin hit the m on their heads and shoulders until They left Oliver alone．</p>
<p>费金微笑着同奥利弗握握手，然后所有的小绅士们都走过来使劲地握着他的双手，尤其是那只拿着他仅有的几件东西的手。一个孩子特别善良，竟然把手伸进了奥利弗的衣袋里，这样奥利弗在睡觉前就无需自己费力气掏出兜里的东西了。如果不是费金使劲地敲打他们的头和肩膀，让他们不再骚扰他，他们还可能会给奥利弗更殷勤的帮助。</p>
<p>‘We’re very glad to see you，Oliver，’said Fagin. ‘I see you’re staring at the handkerchieves， my dear．Aren’t the re a lot？We’ve just taken the m all out to wash the m， that’s all！Ha！ Ha！ Ha！’</p>
<p>“见到你很高兴，奥利弗。”费金说，“我看你是在看那些手帕吧，亲爱的，那岂不是有很多吗？我们把它们全部拿了出来，准备洗一洗，不过如此而已！哈！哈！哈！”</p>
<p>This seemed to be a joke， as the old gentleman and all his young friends gave loud shouts of laughter. The n supper began. Oliver ate his share of the food and was the n given a glass of gin-and-water．Fagin told him to drink it fast．Immediately afterwards，Oliver felt himself lifted onto one of the beds and he sank into a deep sleep．</p>
<p>这好像是一句笑话，因为老先生和他这些年轻的朋友都大笑起来。然后晚饭开始了。奥利弗吃完了他的一份，大家又给了他一杯加了水的杜松子酒。费金让他一口气喝下去。不一会儿，他觉得被人抬起来放在了一张床上，便睡了过去。</p>
<p>When he woke，it was late morning．Fagin was the only other person in the room， and he was boiling coffee in a pan．When the coffee was done，he turned towards Oliver and looked closely at the boy．Oliver was only just awake and his eyes were half－closed， so he seemed to be still fast asleep. Fagin the n locked the door and from a hidden hole in the floor，he took out a small box， which he placed carefully on the table． His eyes shone as he opened it and took out a gold watch covered in jewels.</p>
<p>他一觉醒来，时间已近中午，屋里只有费金一个人，他正在用一个平底锅煮咖啡。咖啡煮好后，他转身仔细看了一眼奥利弗。奥利弗这时刚刚醒来，眼睛还是半闭着的，所以，好像还在沉睡着。然后费金锁上了房门，从地板上一个隐蔽的洞里拿出了一个小盒子。他将小盒子小心地放在桌子上，打开盒盖，从里面拿出了一块满镶着宝石的金表。他看着金表，眼睛发出了贪婪的光。</p>
<p>‘Aah！’ he said to himself． ‘What fine men They were！Loyal to the end. They never told the priest where the jewels were． Nor about old Fagin．Not even at the very end． And why should They？ It was already too late．It wouldn’t have stopped the rope going round their necks！’</p>
<p>“嗳呀！”他自言自语地说，“他们是多好的人啊！忠诚到底。他们一直没告诉牧师珠宝在什么地方。也没把我老费金招出来。直到最后。他们为什么要招出来呢？当时已经太晚了，招了也已经无法去掉就要套在他们脖子上的绳索了！”</p>
<p>Fagin took out at least six more watches， as well as rings and bracelets and many other valuable pieces of jewellery． He looked at the m with pleasure， the n replaced the m. ‘What a good thing hanging is！’he murmured． ‘Dead men can never talk，or betray old friends！’</p>
<p>费金又拿出了至少六块手表，还有戒指、手镯和其它一些贵重的宝石饰品。他欣喜地看着这些东西，之后，又放了回去。“绞刑是多么好的事！”他咕哝着，“人死了就再也不能开口说话了，也不能背叛老朋友了！”</p>
<p>At that moment he looked up and saw Oliver watching him．He closed the lid of the box with a loud crash，and picked up a bread knife from the table． ‘Why are you watching me？ What have you seen？ Tell me－quick！’</p>
<p>就在这时，他抬起头，看见奥利弗正在盯着他看。他哗啦一下盖上了盒盖，从桌上抓起一把面包刀。“你为什么看着我？你都看见什么了？快告诉我！”</p>
<p>‘I couldn’t sleep any longer，sir，’said Oliver， terrified. ‘I’m very sorry．’</p>
<p>“我醒来后睡不着了，先生。”奥利弗吓得魂不附体地说，“对不起！”</p>
<p>‘You weren’t awake an hour ago？’Fagin asked fiercely，still holding the knife.</p>
<p>“一小时以前你没有醒吧？”他凶恶地问，手里仍然攥着那把刀。</p>
<p>‘I promise I was n’t， sir，’ replied Oliver．</p>
<p>“我保证，我没有，先生。”奥利弗回答说。</p>
<p>‘Don’t worry， my dear，’ Fagin said， putting down the knife and becoming once again the kind old gentleman． He laughed． ‘I only tried to frighten you，my dear. You’re a brave boy，Oliver！ And did you see any of the pretty things？’</p>
<p>“别担心，亲爱的。”费金说着，放下手里的刀，又成了原来那个善良的老先生了。他大笑着说：“我只是想吓唬吓唬你，亲爱的。你是个勇敢的孩子，奥利弗！你看见那些漂亮的东西了吗？”</p>
<p>‘Yes， sir. ‘</p>
<p>“是的，先生。”</p>
<p>‘Ah，’ said Fagin， turning rather pale． ‘They-They’re mine， Oliver．All I have，in my old age．’</p>
<p>“噢！”费金应着，脸变得相当白了，“那——那是我自己的东西，奥利弗。是我这老头子全部的家当。”</p>
<p>Oliver wondered why the old man lived in such an old， dirty place，when he had so many watches， but the n he thought that it must cost Fagin a lot of money to look after the Dodger and the other boys．So he said nothing，and got up and washed．When he turned towards Fagin， the box had disappeared．</p>
<p>奥利弗很纳闷，这老头有那么多金表，他为什么还住在这么陈旧、破烂的地方；不过，然后他又想，他养活神偷和其他的孩子们肯定也得花去许多钱。因此他什么也没说，就起身去洗脸了，当他再转身看费金时，那只盒子已经不见了。</p>
<p>Soon the Dodger entered with a cheerful young man named Charley Bates．</p>
<p>不一会儿，神偷和一个叫查理&middot;贝茨的乐呵呵的年轻人走了进来。</p>
<p>‘Have you been at work this morning？’Fagin asked the Dodger．</p>
<p>“今儿上午你们工作了吗？”费金问神偷。</p>
<p>‘Hard at work，’answered the Dodger．</p>
<p>“干得很卖劲。”神偷回答说。</p>
<p>‘Good boys，good boys！’said Fagin． ‘What have you got？’</p>
<p>“好孩子，好孩子！”费金说，“你们都弄到什么了？”</p>
<p>‘A couple of pocket－books and some handkerchieves．’</p>
<p>“几个皮夹子和几条手帕。”</p>
<p>‘Good workers， aren’t They， Oliver？’ said the old man．</p>
<p>“他们是好工人，对不对，奥利弗？”老头说。</p>
<p>‘Very good，’ said Oliver． The others all started laughing，though Oliver saw nothing funny in his answer. Fagin inspected the handkerchieves and told the two boys that They were extremely well made and that he was very pleased with their work.</p>
<p>“非常好。”奥利弗说。别人都笑了，可奥利弗并不觉得他的回答有什么好笑的。费金查看过手帕，告诉两个孩子这些手帕做工精美，并表示对他们的工作感到高兴。</p>
<p>After breakfast They played a very strange game. The cheerful old man put a watch in his jacket pocket， with a guard-chain round his neck，and a notebook and a handkerchief in his trouser pocket．The n he went up and down the room holding a walking stick，just like the old gentlemen who walked in the streets. Sometimes he stopped at the fireplace， and sometimes at the door， pretending to stare with great interest into shop windows．He would the n constantly look round， as if afraid of thieves， touching all his pockets in such a natural and funny way that Oliver laughed until tears ran down his face．All the time， the two boys followed Fagin everywhere，and every time he turned round， They moved out of his sight so quickly that it was impossible to follow their movements.</p>
<p>早饭后，他们做着一种奇特的游戏。高高兴兴的老头将一块手表揣进他的上衣兜里，将表链套在脖子上，再把一个小本和一条手帕装进裤袋里。然后他手里拄着手杖，来回地在屋里走着，就好像那些走在马路上的年老的绅士一样。他一会儿停在炉旁，一会儿停在门口处，假装饶有兴趣地看着橱窗里的东西。他不停地左顾右盼，用一种自然而滑稽的动作摸索着浑身上下的衣兜，好像是怕有小偷。奥利弗被逗得笑出了眼泪。两个男孩一直跟在费金的身后，每当他转身时，他们俩就立刻躲得没影了，让他很难跟上他们的动作。</p>
<p>Finally， the Dodger bumped into him accidentally from behind， and at that moment both boys took from him，very quickly， his watch， guard－chain，handkerchief，and notebook．If the old man felt a hand in any of his pockets he cried out， and the n the game began again.</p>
<p>最后，神偷偶然地从后面撞了他一下，就在这个节骨眼上，他身上的手表、表链、手帕、记事本都到了两个男孩手里。如果老头感到有手伸进兜里，他就叫一声。接着游戏又重新开始。</p>
<p>Later， the boys went out again to do some more work. When They had gone，Fagin turned to Oliver． ‘Take my advice， my dear，’he said． ‘Make the m your models. Especially the Dodger． He’ll be a great man himself， and will make you one too, if you copy him. Is my handkerchief hanging out of my pocket, my dear? '</p>
<p>之后，孩子们又出去做更多的工作了。他们走后，费金转向奥利弗。“听我的话，亲爱的，”他说，“照着他们的榜样去做，特别是神偷，他自己将来会成为一个了不起的人，假如你跟他学，你也会成为一个了不起的人的。我的手帕是不是从兜里耷拉到外面了，亲爱的？”</p>
<p>'Yes, sir, 'said Oliver.</p>
<p>“是的，先生。”奥利弗说。</p>
<p>'See if you can take it out, without my feeling it. Just as you saw the m doing it when we were playing. '</p>
<p>“试试看，你是否能在我不知不觉中将它拿走，就像你刚才看到他们做的那样。”</p>
<p>Oliver held up the bottom of the pocket with one hand, as he had seen the Dodger hold it, and pulled the handkerchief lightly out of it with the other.</p>
<p>奥利弗学着神偷的样子，一只手向上托住衣兜的底部，用另一只手轻轻抽出了手帕。</p>
<p>'Has it gone? 'asked Fagin.</p>
<p>“拿走了吗？”费金问。</p>
<p>'Here it is, sir, 'said Oliver, showing it in his hand.</p>
<p>“在这儿呢，先生。”奥利弗说着把手里的手帕给他看。</p>
<p>'You're a clever boy, my dear, 'said the old gentleman, putting his hand on Oliver's head. I've never seen a quicker boy. If you go on like this, you'll be the greatest man in London. Now come here and I'll show you how to take the marks out of handkerchieves. '</p>
<p>“你真是个聪明的孩子，亲爱的。”老先生摸着奥利弗的头说，“我还从没见过比你更伶俐的孩子，如果你照着这样继续学下去，你会成为伦敦最伟大的人物。你过来，我教给你怎样去掉手帕上的记号。”</p>
<p>Oliver wondered what the connection was between playing at stealing from the old gentleman's pocket and becoming a great man. But he followed him quietly to the table and was soon deeply involved in his new study.</p>
<p>奥利弗搞不明白，玩从老先生兜里偷东西的游戏和成为一个伟大的人物这二者之间有什么联系。但他一声不响地跟他走到了桌边，很快便投入了这项新的学习。</p>
<p>Oliver remained in Fagin's room for many days, picking the marks and names out of the handkerchieves and sometimes playing the same game as before. One evening two young ladies came to visit, and a very cheerful party followed. Oliver thought They were very nice, friendly girls.</p>
<p>奥利弗在费金的屋里待了许多天，学习拆掉手帕上的记号和名字，有时也玩和以前一样的那个游戏。一天晚上，有两位年轻的女士前来造访，他们在一起聚会，玩得非常愉快。奥利弗觉得这两个女孩非常和善友好。</p>
<p>The Dodger and Charley Bates went out to work every day, but sometimes came home with no handkerchieves, and Fagin would get very angry. Once he even knocked the m both down the stairs and sent the m to bed with no dinner because They had returned with nothing.</p>
<p>神偷和查理&middot;贝茨每天都出去工作，但有时他们带不回来手帕，这时，费金就很生气。有一次，就因为他们没带回东西来，他竟然将他们俩打下楼梯，并且不给他们吃晚饭。</p>
<p>At last, the morning came when Oliver was allowed to go out to work with the two other boys The re had been no handkerchieves for him to work on for several days and the re was not very much to eat for dinner. The three boys set out, but They walked so slowly that Oliver thought They were not going to work at all. The n suddenly the Dodger stopped and put his finger to his lips.</p>
<p>这天早上，奥利弗终于被允许与这两个男孩一起出去工作。他们已经有好几天没带回手帕来给他拆记号了，所以他们也没能吃到足够的晚饭。早晨，这三个男孩子出发了。他们走得非常慢，使奥利弗以为他们不是去工作的。突然，神偷停住了脚步，将一个手指竖在嘴唇上。</p>
<p>'What's the matter? 'demanded Oliver.</p>
<p>“出了什么事？”奥利弗问。</p>
<p>'Be quiet! 'replied the Dodger. 'Do you see that old man outside the book shop? He's the one. '</p>
<p>“别出声！”神偷说，“你看见站在书店外面的那个老头了吗？就是他。”</p>
<p>Oliver looked from the Dodger to Charley Bates with great surprise and confusion, but he had been told not to ask questions. The two boys walked quickly and secretly across the road towards the old gentleman. Oliver followed behind the m, watching in silent amazement.</p>
<p>奥利弗极度惊奇和迷惑地看看神偷，又看看查理&middot;贝茨，但人家告诉过他不许提问题。两个男孩偷偷地快速穿过马路，朝老先生走去，奥利弗尾随在他们后面，惊奇地悄悄看着。</p>
<p>The old gentleman looked quite rich; he wore gold glasses, white trousers, and had an expensive walking stick under his arm. He had picked up a book and was standing the re, reading it with great concentration—just as if he were in his own armchair at home. Oliver, his eyes wide with horror and alarm, watched as the Dodger put his hand in the old gentleman's pocket, took out a hand kerchief, and hand ed it to Charley Bates. The n the two of the m ran round the corner as fast as They could.</p>
<p>老先生看上去很富有，他戴着一副金边眼镜，身穿一条白色裤子，一根昂贵的手杖夹在腋下。他从书摊上拿起一本书，站在那儿专心地看着——就好像坐在家里的软椅上一样。奥利弗睁大了一双恐惧和惊慌的眼睛，看着神偷将手伸进了老先生的兜里，抽出了一条丝手帕，递给了查理&middot;贝茨，然后两人绕过拐角尽快地跑开了。</p>
<p>Suddenly, the whole mystery of the handkerchieves, and the watches, and the jewels, and Fagin, became clear. Oliver stood for a moment in terror, blood rushing through him until he felt he was on fire. The n, confused and frightened, he started to run. At the same time, the old gentleman, putting his hand to his pocket and realizing his hand kerchief was missing, turned round. He saw Oliver running away, so he naturally thought Oliver was the thief. With loud cries of 'Stop thief! ', he ran after Oliver with the book still in his hand .</p>
<p>顿时，关于手帕的秘密及手表、宝石和费金的事都变得一清二楚了。奥利弗害怕地在那里站了一会儿，感到浑身的血流加快了，他觉得自己在发烧。然后，迷惑和害怕使他撒腿就跑。就在这时，老先生把手伸进了裤兜里，发现手帕不见了，他转过身来，正好看见奥利弗从他身边跑开，所以，理所当然地，他认为奥利弗是小偷。他大声地喊着：“抓贼！”并追赶着奥利弗，手里仍然拿着那本书。</p>
<p>The old gentleman was not the only one who started shouting. The Dodger and Charley Bates, not wanting to attract attention to the mselves by running down the street, had stopped round the first corner. When They realized what was happening, They also shouted' Stop thief! 'and joined in the chase like good citizens.</p>
<p>喊叫起来的人不止老先生一个，神偷和查理&middot;贝茨为了不一直顺着马路跑下去而引起别人的注意，已停在了第一个拐角处。当他们认识到发生了什么事时，也掺和在人群里，像好公民一样喊着：“抓贼！”并参加了追逐。</p>
<p>The cry of 'Stop thief! 'always causes great excitement. Everybody in the street stopped what They were doing and began to shout the mselves. Many joined in the chase with enthusiasm and soon the re was a big crowd running after Oliver.</p>
<p>“抓贼！”这喊声往往能引起极大的骚动。街上的每一个人都停下正在做的事，跟着喊。许多人以极大的热情加入了追逐的人群。很快就有一大帮人在追赶奥利弗。</p>
<p>Finally, They caught the exhausted boy. He fell down on the pavement and the crowd gathered round him.</p>
<p>最后，这个筋疲力尽的孩子终于被他们抓住了。他摔倒在人行道上，人们将他团团围祝</p>
<p>'Is this the boy? 'They asked the old gentleman.</p>
<p>“是这个男孩吗？”他们问老先生。</p>
<p>'Yes, 'he answered, leaning over Oliver. 'But I'm afraid he's hurt himself. '</p>
<p>“是的。”他回答道，并俯下身看着奥利弗。“恐怕他是伤着自己了。”</p>
<p>'I did that, 'said a huge young man proudly. 'And I hurt my hand doing it. 'The old gentleman looked at him with an expression of dislike.</p>
<p>“那是我弄的，”一个大个子年轻人自豪地说，“都把我的手弄痛了。”老先生反感地看了他一眼。</p>
<p>Oliver lay on the ground, covered with mud and dust and bleeding from the mouth, and looked wildly at all the faces surrounding him. At that moment a policeman arrived and took Oliver by the collar. 'Come on, get up, 'he said roughly.</p>
<p>奥利弗躺在地上，浑身上下沾满了泥土，嘴里往外流着血，惊慌失措地看着围着他的一张张面孔。不一会儿，警察赶来了，抓住领子拎起了奥利弗，粗暴地说：“站起来，跟我走！”</p>
<p>'It wasn't me, sir, 'said Oliver, looking round. 'It was two other boys. They're here somewhere. '</p>
<p>“先生，不是我，”奥利弗四下里张望着说，“是另外的两个男孩，他们就在附近的什么地方。”</p>
<p>'Oh no, They aren't, 'replied the policeman. In fact, he was right, as the Dodger and Charley had quietly disappeared as soon as the crowd had caught Oliver. 'Come on, get up! '</p>
<p>“噢，不，他们不在这里。”警察说。其实，他说得对，在追赶的人群将奥利弗抓住后，神偷和查理&middot;贝茨就溜之大吉了。“起来！”</p>
<p>'Don't hurt him, 'said the old gentleman.</p>
<p>“别打他。”老先生说。</p>
<p>'I won't, said the policeman, tearing Oliver's jacket half off his back as he lifted him up.</p>
<p>“我不会打他的。”警察说着将他从地上拉起来，差点儿把他的上衣从身上扯下来。</p>
<p>The three of the m started walking, followed by the excited crowd.</p>
<p>他们三个人朝前走去，沸沸扬扬的人群跟在他们身后。</p><a href='5.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
