<p><b>12 南希如期赴约 </b></p>
<p>On exactly the same night as Nancy had met Rose May lie，two people from Oliver’s home town were making their way towards London．Their progress was slow，since they travelled on foot，and in addition，the girl was carrying a heavy bag on her back．The young man carried nothing．From time to time he turned to shout at the girl behind him． ‘Hurry up！What a lazy creature you are，Charlotte！I’ll come and give you a kick if you don’t move faster！’</p>
<p>就在南希去见罗斯&middot;梅利的那个晚上，两个从奥利弗家乡来的人正朝伦敦走来。因为他们是徒步行走，加之其中的女孩背上还背着一个沉重的大包，所以进度很慢。身边的年轻男子却空着两手，还时不时地转过身去朝跟在后面的女孩大声吼着：“快点，夏洛特，你这个懒东西！你再这么磨磨蹭蹭的，我可就要踢你一脚了。”</p>
<p>The young man was Noah Claypole，who had made Oliver’s life so miserable at Mr Sowerberry’s house．He was now taller and uglier but otherwise little changed．He and Charlotte had grown tired of the undertaking business and had set off to London to start a new life-with all the money from Mr So wer berry’s shop in their pockets．</p>
<p>这个年轻的男人是诺厄&middot;克莱普尔，就是他使奥利弗在索尔贝里先生家受够了折磨。他现在长高了一点，比以前更丑了点，此外没有什么大的变化。他与夏洛特厌倦了棺材店的生意，想到伦敦去开始新的生活——他们卷走了索尔贝里先生棺材店所有的钱财。</p>
<p>Eventually，They entered London，and Noah began to look for a quiet，cheap pub where They could spend the night．Charlotte followed obediently at his heels as They walked through a district of narrow，dirty streets．</p>
<p>他们终于到达了伦敦，诺厄试图找一家既安静又便宜的酒店过夜。在穿过一个街道狭窄脏乱的地区时，夏洛特顺从地跟在他身后。</p>
<p>At last Noah found a pub that he thought was suitable．It was dark and dirty，with a few rough-looking men in the bar．They entered and asked for a room for the night and a meal of cold meat and beer，which They ate in the bar．The beer madeNoah talkative and he began to boast． ‘So it’s no more coffins for us，my girl．We can do better than just robbing Mr So wer berry．In London the re are pockets，houses，coaches-even banks！’</p>
<p>终于，诺厄找到了一家他认为合适的酒店。店里昏暗、肮脏，吧台前坐着几个相貌粗鲁的人。他们走进去，要了房间和晚饭。晚饭是一盘冷肉和一些啤酒，他们坐在吧台前吃了起来。啤酒一下肚，诺厄便打开了话匣子，胡吹一气：“现在我们再也不用天天和棺材打交道了，我的姑娘。从今往后我们要比偷盗索尔贝里先生干得更大。在伦敦，有的是有钱的口袋、大宅子、马车——还有银行！”</p>
<p>‘I like the sound of it，Noah，but how are we going to do all this？’asked Charlotte．</p>
<p>“这听起来很叫人喜欢，诺厄。可是我们怎么去干这些事呢？”夏洛特问。</p>
<p>‘We can meet people who know about the se things．I’d like to be the leader of some gang，if the re’s a good profit to be made in that kind of work．’Noah felt very pleased with himself，and looked forward to an easy life of crime in the capital．</p>
<p>“我们得结认一些懂得这一行的人，如果干这些事很来钱，我就当某个团伙的头头。”诺厄这时洋洋得意，他渴望在首都过一种作奸犯科的安逸生活。</p>
<p>They talked about their plans for a few minutes．The n astranger，who had been sitting unseen round the corner，cameup to the m．The stranger was Fagin．He greeted the m in avery friendly and cheerful way，sat down with the m，and immediately ordered more beer for Noah．</p>
<p>他们谈着自己的打算，说了几分钟。这时，一个坐在看不见的拐角处的陌生人朝他们走来。这人就是费金。他同他们非常友好而热情地打着招呼，坐了下来，又马上为诺厄要了些啤酒。</p>
<p>‘That’s good beer，’said Noah，already a little drunk．He thanked the stranger for the drink．</p>
<p>“这啤酒还不错，”诺厄已经颇有醉意，他向陌生人表示了谢意。</p>
<p>‘Expensive，too，’said Fagin． ‘If you drink that everyday，my dear，you’ll need to empty pockets，houses，coaches，even banks．’</p>
<p>“但是并不便宜。”费金说。“亲爱的，如果你天天喝的话，你必须去从口袋、房子、马车和银行里弄钱。”</p>
<p>When he heard his own words repeated，Noah went pale with terror．The stranger must have heard everything，even how They had robbed Mr So wer berry！</p>
<p>诺厄一听这人在重复刚才自己说过的话，有点害怕。这人肯定把他们刚才说的话全都偷听去了，就连他们偷了索尔贝里先生钱的事也知道了！</p>
<p>‘Don’t worry，’laughed Fagin，pulling his chair closer． ‘You’re lucky it was only me who heard you．’</p>
<p>“别害怕，”费金大笑着，把椅子朝近处拉了拉，“你们很幸运，只有我听见了你们的话。”</p>
<p>‘I didn’t take it，’said Noah quickly． ‘It was the woman who did it！’</p>
<p>“我没拿，”诺厄赶紧说，“都是这女人干的！”</p>
<p>‘It does n’t matter who did it，my dear，replied Fagin，looking quickly at Charlotte． ‘Because I’m in that business myself．And the people in my house as well．I can in trod uce you to the right people，if you’re interested．You both look like good workers．’</p>
<p>“是谁干的都没关系，亲爱的，”费金说着瞟了一眼夏洛特，“因为我也是干这一行的。还有跟我住在一起的一些人也是如此。如果你们有兴趣的话，我可以把你们介绍给干这一行的人。你们俩看上去很能干。”</p>
<p>Charlotte and Noah felt a mixture of fear and pleasure． ‘What would you want me to do？’asked Noah． ‘Some thing light，if possible，’he added．</p>
<p>夏洛特和诺厄又惊又喜。“你要我干点什么呢？”诺厄问。“一点轻活，假如可能的话。”他又说。</p>
<p>‘What about spying on people？’asked Fagin． ‘Or robbing young children who are going shopping for their mothers？That’s light work，and easy．’</p>
<p>“暗地里监视人怎么样？”费金说，“或是去抢到商店里替母亲买东西的孩子？这些都是轻活，也是好干的活。”</p>
<p>Noah laughed． ‘That sounds like just the thing for me！And what will I earn for this work？’</p>
<p>诺厄大笑起来。“这听上去正是适合我的事！那么我能挣到多少钱呢？”</p>
<p>‘You can live free in my house，and give me half of what you earn．</p>
<p>“你可以免费在我家住，只是把挣来的东西分给我一半就行了。”</p>
<p>After fur the r discussion，and the transfer of Mr So wer berry’s money from Noah’s pocket to Fagin’s，agreement was reached．The next day Noah and Charlotte went to live in Fagin’s house and began to be instructed in their new profession．</p>
<p>经过进一步的商量，索尔贝里先生的钱从诺厄衣袋里又全装进了费金的衣袋，双方达成了协议。从第二天开始，诺厄和夏洛特就搬到费金家去住，并开始新职业的训练。</p>
<p>Although training and experience had made Nancy an exper tliar，she could not completely hide the fear in her mind．She knew she had taken an enormous risk in going to see RoseMay lie．If Fagin or Sikes ever found out…But she pushed the se fears away．She was determined to keep her promise to Rose May lie，and meet her as arranged．</p>
<p>尽管训练和经验使南希成为一个内行的骗子，但她无法完全掩盖内心的恐惧。她知道自己是冒着极大的风险去见罗斯&middot;梅利的。一旦费金或赛克斯察觉了这一切……但她把这些恐惧推到一边。她决心信守对罗斯&middot;梅利许下的诺言，按照安排好的时间地点去见她。</p>
<p>On the first Sunday night after her meeting with Rose，she was in Sikes’ room when the clock struck eleven．Fagin was the re，too，discussing some business with Sikes．Nancy stood up and put on her coat．Sikes watched her，surprised．</p>
<p>在见过罗斯之后的第一个星期天的晚上，她正在赛克斯的房间里，这时钟敲响了11点，费金也在这里，正跟赛克斯商量着什么事。南希站了起来，穿上了大衣。赛克斯惊奇地看着她。</p>
<p>‘Nancy！Where are you going at this time of night？’</p>
<p>“南希！都晚上这个时候了，你还要去哪儿？”</p>
<p>‘Not far．’</p>
<p>“就在附近走走。”</p>
<p>‘What kind of answer is that？Where are you going？’</p>
<p>“这是什么话？你要去什么地方？”</p>
<p>‘I don’t know，’replied the girl．</p>
<p>“我也不知道。”女孩回答说。</p>
<p>‘The n I do．Nowhere．Sit down．’</p>
<p>“那么我知道。你哪儿也甭去了。坐下。”</p>
<p>‘I’m not well．I want a breath of air．’</p>
<p>“我不舒服，想到外面去换换空气。”</p>
<p>Sikes got up and locked the door．</p>
<p>赛克斯站了起来，锁上了房门。</p>
<p>‘Let me go！’said the girl with great force． ‘Just for one hour-let me go！’</p>
<p>“让我出去！”女孩力争道，“就一个小时——让我去一下！”</p>
<p>Sikes seized her arms roughly． ‘The girl’s gone mad！’</p>
<p>赛克斯粗暴地抓住她的胳膊。“这丫头八成是疯了！”</p>
<p>Nancy fought wildly，and Sikes had to hold her down in a chair．She continued to scream and fight until midnight，when，exhausted and tearful，she stopped struggling．She went into another room and threw herself on a bed．</p>
<p>南希极力反抗着，赛克斯不得不将她按在椅子上。她不停地尖叫挣扎着，一直到午夜，她已泪流满面，疲惫不堪，才停止了挣扎。她走进了另一个房间，一头倒在了床上。</p>
<p>‘She’s a strange girl，’Sikes said to Fagin，shaking his head． ‘Why did she suddenly decide to go out tonight？It hought that after all the se years I’d finally tamed her．She must be ill-perhaps she’s still got a bit of fever．’</p>
<p>“她真是个怪人，”赛克斯摇着头跟费金说，“她是怎么回事，今晚上突然决定非要出去不可？我还以为，经过这些年我已经驯服她了呢。她一定是不舒服了——大概热病还没好利索。”</p>
<p>‘That must be it，’said Fagin，nodding thoughtfully．</p>
<p>“一定是这么回事，”费金多虑地点着头说。</p>
<p>As he walked home，Fagin’s eyes were sharp with suspicion．He had suspected for a while that Nancy had become tired of Bill Sikes’ brutality and violence，and that she had found a new friend to take his place．Her manner was different；she often left home alone，and she seemed lessinterested in the gang．And tonight，her desperate impatience to go out at a particular hour…He was certain he was right．He began to make plans．</p>
<p>在回家的路上，费金两眼放出狡猾的光，充满了疑虑。一段时间以来，他怀疑南希大概是厌烦比尔&middot;赛克斯的蛮横和暴力了，怀疑她可能有了代替赛克斯的新朋友。她的态度也同过去不一样了；她老是一个人往外跑，好像对这个团伙也没什么兴趣了。而且，今天晚上，又是在某一特定的时间里急于出去……他肯定自己的怀疑是对的。他开始布设一个计谋。</p>
<p>First，he wanted to know who Nancy’s new friend was．He could make him a valuable new member of the gang，with Nancy as his assistant．But the re was another，darker reason．Fagin，too，had become tired of Sikes．Sikes knew too much-too many dangerous secrets about Fagin himself．Fagin distrusted everybody，but he hated and distrusted Sikes most of all．It would be very convenient if Sikes could be…removed．</p>
<p>首先，他想要弄清南希的新朋友是谁。他可以使他也成为这个帮伙重要的新成员，让南希做他的助手。但是，其另外一个险恶的用心是，费金也有点厌烦赛克斯了。赛克斯知道的事太多了——而且许多是有关费金的致命的秘密。费金从不相信任何一个人，而他最恨、最不信任的人则是赛克斯。假如能把赛克斯……除掉，那就方便多了。</p>
<p>‘With a little persuasion，’Fagin thought， ‘perhaps the girl would poison Sikes．’Suddenly，his eyes narrowed in delight． ‘Yes！First，I must have her watched，and find out who her new man is．The n I shall threaten to tell Sikes everything．She knows that neither she nor her new man will ever be safe from Sikes’ violent jealousy．She will have no choice except to do as I ask her-and the n，once the murder is done，she will be in my power for ever！’</p>
<p>“稍加劝说，”费金想，“这姑娘没准会把赛克斯毒死。”突然，他高兴地眯起了眼睛。“对！首先，我得叫人跟踪她，弄清楚她的新情人是谁。然后，我威胁说要把这一切都告诉赛克斯。这样，她知道由于赛克斯极度地忌妒，她自己和新情人都将永远不得安生。到那时，她束手无策，只能乖乖地按照我说的去做——一旦谋杀成功，她就将永远被我掌握了！”</p>
<p>Early next morning Fagin called the newest member of his gang．Noah was doing very well．He had already broughthome quite a lot of money．He had found that robbing small children was indeed light，easy work，and he was proud of his success．</p>
<p>第二天一大早，费金叫过他们匪帮里最新的成员。诺厄干得很出色，他已经拿回来不少钱了。他发现抢小孩的钱真是一件轻松容易的工作，正为自己的成功感到得意呢。</p>
<p>‘I have another job for you now，’Fagin told him． ‘It needs great care and secrecy．I want you to follow a woman．I want to know where she goes，who she sees，and if possible，what she says．I will pay you a pound for this information．’</p>
<p>“我另有一件工作需要你去做，”费金跟他说，“这得干得十分小心和秘密。我要你去跟踪一个女人。我要知道她去的是什么地方，跟什么人见面，如果可能的话，最好是能知道他们说了些什么。弄清了这些事，我给你一个英镑。”</p>
<p>Noah’s eyes were wide with greed． ‘I’m the right man forthis job．Who is she？’</p>
<p>诺厄贪婪地睁大了眼睛。“我干这事最拿手，她是谁？”</p>
<p>‘One of us．’</p>
<p>“一个自己人。”</p>
<p>‘What？You don’t trust her，the n？’</p>
<p>“什么？这么说，你信不过她？”</p>
<p>‘Exactly so，my dear．Exactly so，’smiled Fagin．</p>
<p>“亲爱的，说得对，说得对，”费金笑了笑。</p>
<p>The following Sunday，soon after eleven o’clock，a woman walked quickly through the dark streets towards Lond on Bridge．A mist hung over the river，and the buildings on the far bank could hardly be seen．A man followed some distance behind her，keeping to the darkest shadows．It was a cold，damp night，and the re were very few people on the streets at this late hour．</p>
<p>下一个星期天的晚上，刚过了11点，一个女人匆匆地穿过漆黑的街道朝伦敦桥的方向走去。雾气笼罩在河上，河对岸的楼房几乎看不见。一个男人远远地尾随着她，尽可能地藏身在黑影里。这是一个既寒冷又潮湿的夜晚，加之已是深夜11点了，街上行人稀少。</p>
<p>When the woman reached the centre of the bridge，she stopped and looked around anxiously．The man following hers topped too．The heavy bell of St Paul’s cathe dral rang out，announcing the death of another day．Just as it finished，agrey haired man and a young woman got out of a coach and walked across the bridge．They met the woman，who tookthe m down some steps leading to the river bank．They stood indeep shadow by the wall of the bridge．The man hurried down some other steps，crept up to the corner of the wall，and listened．</p>
<p>这个女人来到了桥中间，停下脚步，焦急地四处张望着。跟在她身后的男人也停了下来。圣保罗大教堂的大钟敲响了，宣布又一天的结束。钟声刚刚停止，一位灰白头发的男人和一个年轻女人从一辆马车上跳了下来，走过桥去。他们同这个女人会了面，女人带着他们沿河岸的台阶走了下去。他们站在桥身的黑影处。那男人赶紧从另一处也下了台阶，蹑手蹑脚地走到了桥身的拐角处，静静地偷听着。</p>
<p>Nancy spoke first． ‘I’m so frightened tonight I can hardly breathe ．’</p>
<p>南希先开口说话了。“我太害怕了，都快喘不上气来了。”</p>
<p>‘Frightened of what？’asked Mr Brown low ．He seemed topity her．</p>
<p>“怕什么？”布朗洛先生问，他看上去很可怜她。</p>
<p>‘I wish I knew．Horrible thoughts of death，and blood，have been with me all day．I don’t know why．’</p>
<p>“不知为什么。死啦，出血啦，这些可怕的想法整天老缠着我。不知为什么。”</p>
<p>‘Speak to her kindly，’said Rose to Mr Brown low ． ‘Poorgirl！She seems to need it．’</p>
<p>“要和蔼地跟她说话，”罗斯跟布朗洛先生说，“这可怜的姑娘，她好像需要的就是这个。”</p>
<p>‘I could n’t come last Sunday，’continued the girl． ‘I was kept in by force．But tonight he’ll be out all night untilday light．Now，before I tell rou anything else，I must tell you that I don’t want Fagin，or any of the other members of the gang，to be hand ed to the police．’</p>
<p>“上星期天我没能出来，”姑娘接着说，“我被强留在家里了。可今晚上他出去了，要一直到天亮才能回来。听我说，在我告诉你们任何别的话之前，我必须告诉你们，我不想让费金或是团伙里的任何一个人被警察抓起来。”</p>
<p>‘Why not？’</p>
<p>“为什么？”</p>
<p>‘Because I couldn’t betray the m．They’ve been loyal to me，and I’ll stay loyal to the m．’</p>
<p>“因为我不能背叛他们。他们一直忠实于我，我也得忠实于他们。”</p>
<p>‘The n just tell us how we can get Monks，and I promisen one of your friends will be harmed，’said Mr Brown low ．</p>
<p>“那么只告诉我们怎样才能找到蒙克斯，我保证你的任何一个朋友都不会受到伤害，”布朗洛先生说。</p>
<p>‘And Monks will never know how you found out about him？’she asked．</p>
<p>“蒙克斯也将永远不会知道你们是怎样发现他的秘密的吗？”她问。</p>
<p>‘We promise，’said Rose gently．</p>
<p>“我们保证他不会知道的。”罗斯轻柔地说。</p>
<p>Nancy the n told the m，in so low a voice that the listenerround the corner could hardly hear her，where Monks often went for a drink，and what he looked like．She finished by saying， ‘On his throat，high up，the re is—’</p>
<p>然后南希用极小的声音跟他们说话，躲在墙拐角处的男人几乎什么也听不见。她告诉他们蒙克斯常去喝酒的地方，以及他的长相，她最后说：“在他的喉头，靠上面的地方，有一个——”</p>
<p>‘A bright red mark？’asked Mr Brown low ．</p>
<p>“一个鲜红的痣？”布朗洛先生问道。</p>
<p>‘Do you know him？’asked Nancy in surprise．</p>
<p>“您认识他？”南希惊讶地问。</p>
<p>‘I think I do．’Mr Brown low murmured to himself， ‘It must be him！’The n more loudly，he said to Nancy， ‘Thank you for everything you’ve told us．But now-how can you go back to the se people？Come with us now，tonight．We canarr ange for you to be hidden from the m all forever，if you want us to．’</p>
<p>“我想我认识他。”布朗洛先生小声地自言自语着。“肯定是他！”然后他又提高些声音跟南希说：“谢谢你跟我们说了这些。可是，现在你怎么能再回到这种人身旁去呢？今晚干脆跟我们走吧。假如你要求我们这样做，我们会把你永远藏起来，他们任何人再也找不到你。”</p>
<p>The girl shook her head． ‘I’m chained to him，bad as Theyare．I’ve gone too far to change my life now．’She looked nervously over her shoulder． ‘I can feel those dreadful terrors again-visions of blood and death．I must go home．’</p>
<p>这姑娘摇着头。“尽管他们很坏，可我已跟他拴在一起了。我已经走得太远了，已经无法再改变我的生活了。”她惊恐不安地回头看了看，“我又有那种可怕的恐怖感了——我似乎看到了流血和死亡。我得赶紧回去了。”</p>
<p>Mr Brown low and Rose could not persuade her to change her mind Sadly，They turned to leave，and when They had gone，Nancy fell to the ground in a storm of tears．Meanwhile，Noah Claypole，amazed by all that he had heard，crept up the steps and ran for Fagin’s house as fast as his legs could carry him．</p>
<p>布朗洛先生和罗斯无法劝她改变主意，他们伤心地转身走了。当他们离开后，南希哭倒在地，涕泪横流。同时，诺厄&middot;克莱普尔对听到的事十分惊奇，他轻手轻脚地走上了台阶，以最快的速度朝费金家跑去。</p>
<p>Some hours later，nearly two hours before dawn，Noah laya sleep in Fagin’s house．But Fagin sat silently by a dead fire，staring at the flame of a candle on tne table beside him．With his pale，wrinkled face and his red，staring eyes，he looked like a devil out of hell．Hatred ran like poison through hisevery thought．Hatred for the girl who had dared to talk to strangers，who had ruined his plan to get rid of Sikes．He did not believe her promise not to betray him，and he feared that he would now be caught，and hung．</p>
<p>几小时之后，离天亮大约还有两小时，诺厄在费金家睡着了，而费金却默默地坐在已经灭了的炉火旁，盯着身旁桌上的蜡烛的火苗。他的一张满是皱纹、毫无血色的脸和一双直勾勾、布满了血丝的眼睛，让他看上去活像刚从地狱里爬出的魔鬼。仇恨像毒液一样浸透了他的每一个想法。这姑娘竟敢向外人泄露他们的秘密，她使他除掉赛克斯的计划破产了——他恨死她了。他不相信她许下的不会出卖他的诺言了，他担心自己现在会被抓起来，送上绞刑架。</p>
<p>Just before dawn Sikes entered the room，carrying a bundle which contained the results of his night’s work．Fagin took what Sikes gave him，the n stared at the robber for a long time with out speaking．</p>
<p>天快亮时，赛克斯走了进来，拿着一个包，里面装着他一晚上工作的收获。费金接过赛克斯给他的东西，盯着这强盗看了半天，没说话。</p>
<p>‘Why are you looking at me like that？’asked Sikes，uneasy at the old man’s strange expression．</p>
<p>“你为什么用这种眼神看着我？”赛克斯看着这老头子奇怪的神色，不安地问。</p>
<p>Fagin raised his hand ，but his passion was so great that hecould not speak．</p>
<p>费金举起手来，但感情过分激动，仍说不出话来。</p>
<p>‘Say something，will you！’shouted Sikes，placing his huge hand on Fagin’s collar and shaking him in his anger and fear．</p>
<p>“你说句话，行吗？”赛克斯大声吼着，用一只大手抓住了费金的衣领，又愤怒又恐惧地摇晃着他。</p>
<p>‘Open your mouth and say what you’ve got to say！’</p>
<p>“张开你的嘴，把你要说的话说出来！”</p>
<p>Eventually Fagin found his voice． ‘Bill，what would you do if one of the gang went out at night and told someone all about us，and what we’d done？What would you do to him？’</p>
<p>费金终于能说出话了。“比尔，假如我们团伙当中的一个人晚上出去把我们的事全告诉了别人，我们该怎么办？你会怎么收拾他？”</p>
<p>‘I’d smash his head into little pieces，’said the robber，swearing violently．</p>
<p>“我会把他的脑壳敲个粉碎。”这个盗贼恶狠狠地咒骂着。</p>
<p>‘And what if it was me，who knows so much about all ofus，and could put us all in prison and get us all hanged？’whispered Fagin，his eyes flashing with hate．</p>
<p>“假如这个人是我，知道我们这里的事最多，能使我们一个不落地都进监狱，都被绞死，那又怎么样呢？”费金小声地说，眼睛里闪着憎恨的目光。</p>
<p>‘I’d beat your brains out in public．Even in the law-court，I’d run over and kill you with my bare hand s，’said Sikes，showing his teeth in his anger． ‘I don’t care who it was，that’s what I’d do．’</p>
<p>“我会在大庭广众之下打出你的脑浆来。就是在法庭上，我也会赤手空拳地跑过来杀了你。”赛克斯愤怒得咬牙切齿地说，“我才不管他是谁呢，我就是要这么干。”</p>
<p>Fagin woke Noah． ‘Tell Bill what you told me，what you saw，what she did．Tell him！’</p>
<p>费金叫醒了诺厄。“把你刚才跟我说的话再跟比尔说一遍，说你都看见了什么，她又干了什么。都跟他说！”</p>
<p>Noah rubbed the sleep from his eyes and told Sikes every thing His face white with passion，Sikes listened to the end，the n，swearing furioustly，he rushed from the room and down the stairs．</p>
<p>诺厄揉着惺松的睡眼，把事情的全部经过又跟赛克斯说了一遍。由于感情激动，赛克斯的脸色变得惨白，听完后他恼怒万分地咒骂着，奔出了房间，冲下了楼。</p>
<p>‘Bill！’Fagin called after him． ‘You won’t be…too violent？’</p>
<p>“比尔！”费金在他身后喊道，“你不会……太粗暴了吧？”</p>
<p>Sikes made no reply，but，pulling open the door，ran out into the silent streets．He did not turn his head to right or left，but looked straight in front of him with wild determination．He ran at great speed，his eyes on fire，his teeth tight together，and did not pause until he reached his own door．He ran up to his room，entered and locked the door，put a table against it，the n woke Nancy．</p>
<p>赛克斯没回答，而是拉开房门，跑到了寂静无声的街道上。他头也不回，目不旁视，直瞪瞪地向前看着，疯狂地铁定了一条心。他飞快地跑着，眼睛里冒着火，牙关死死地咬在一起，一口气直跑进了家门。他跑上楼，进了自己的房间，反锁上房门，又拉过来一张桌子顶在了门上，然后才叫醒南希。</p>
<p>‘Bill！’she said，pleased to see him．But when she saw his expression，the colour went out of her face． ‘What’s the matter？’she said in alarm．</p>
<p>“比尔！”她看见他高兴地说。可她发现他的神色不对劲，顿时脸色变得煞白。“出什么事了？”她警觉地问。</p>
<p>‘You know what．’Sikes took out his gun，but realizing，even in his madness，that a shot might be heard，he beat her twice across the face with it as hard as he could．She fell，with low cry of pain and terror，almost blinded by the blood that flowed from the cut on her forehead．The murderer staggered to a corner，seized a heavy stick and struck her down．</p>
<p>“你知道出什么事了。”赛克斯拿出枪，但即便是在这种丧心病狂的时候，他也知道枪声会被人听见的。所以他抡起枪狠狠地朝她的脸上横打了两下，她发出一声痛苦与恐惧的低叫，倒在了地上，从额头的伤口里流出的鲜血糊住了她的眼睛。凶手摇摇晃晃地走到屋角，抓起了一根大木棍将她打倒了。</p><a href='13.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
