<p><b>7 抢劫 </b></p>
<p>A few days later, a visitor arrived in London from Oliver's home town. He was a large, fat man, and very proud of his hat, which showed the world that he was a most important official. It was, in fact, Mr Bumble the beadle, Oliver's old enemy.</p>
<p>几天后，一位来访者从奥利弗家乡的小镇来到了伦敦。他是一个高大、肥胖的人，对自己的帽子感到非常自豪，这帽子向别人表示他是位最重要的官员。其实，他就是班布尔先生，那位执事，奥利弗的老对头。</p>
<p>Mr Bumble had completed his business in the city, and had just finished a most satisfactory meal in a pub. He pulled up his chair to the fire, to enjoy his hot gin-and-water in comfort, and opened the newspaper. The first thing he saw was this notice:</p>
<p>班布尔先生在城里办完了公事，刚在一家酒馆里吃了一顿非常满意的饭菜。他把椅子向炉旁拉了拉，舒服地喝着一杯辣辣的加了水的杜松子酒，打开报纸。首先跳入他眼帘的是这条消息：</p>
<p>A reward of five pounds is offered for any information leading to the discovery of a young boy, Oliver Twist, who was kidnapped from his home in Pentonville last Thursday evening. I am also very interested in any information about his past.</p>
<p>悬赏。奥利弗&middot;特威斯特，男孩，上星期四晚上在他本顿维尔的家中被绑架带走，如有人知道他现在的下落使他能被找到，可得到五英镑的奖赏。本人对他以前的情况也深感兴趣。</p>
<p>The re was the n a full description of Oliver's clothe s and appearance, and Mr Brown low 's full address. Mr Bumble rubbed his eyes, read the notice again, and was at the address in less than ten minutes. He was shown into Mr Brown low 's study, where the old gentleman and his friend Mr Grimwig were sitting.</p>
<p>启事接着详细地描述了奥利弗的穿着和长相，以及布朗洛先生家的详细地址。班布尔先生揉了揉眼睛，把这条消息又看了一遍，不到十分钟，他就找到了那个地址。他被带到了布朗洛先生的书房，这位老先生和他的朋友格里姆威格先生正坐在里面。</p>
<p>'Do you know where the poor boy is now? 'Mr Brown low asked, when the beadle had explained the reason for his visit.</p>
<p>“你知道这可怜的孩子现在在哪儿吗？”执事说明了来意后，布朗洛先生问道。</p>
<p>Mr Bumble shook his head.</p>
<p>班布尔先生摇了摇头。</p>
<p>'Do you know anything good about him? 'asked Mr Grimwig, looking closely at Mr Bumble's face.</p>
<p>“你知道他的任何好的方面吗？”格里姆威格先生仔细打量着班布尔先生的脸，问道。</p>
<p>Mr Bumble shook his head again, very seriously, and turned down the corners of his mouth.</p>
<p>班布尔先生非常严肃地又摇了摇头，撇了撇嘴。</p>
<p>'The n tell us everything you know about him, 'said Mr Brown low impatiently.</p>
<p>“那么，告诉我们你所知道的有关他的一切。”格里姆威格先生不耐烦地说。</p>
<p>Mr Bumble put down his hat, unbuttoned his coat, folded his arms, and sat back in his chair. He spoke in his most important and official voice, and talked for twenty minutes. His listeners heard all the details of Oliver's illegitimate birth, and how generously he had been treated as a workhouse orphan. They heard how he had always been an ungrateful and dangerous child, violently attacking another boy, and finally running away from the house where he had been working.</p>
<p>班布尔先生摘下帽子，解开衣扣，双臂交叉放在胸前，向后靠在椅子上。他用他那重要官员的嗓音说了足足二十分钟。他的听众知道了奥利弗非法出生的详细过程，以及作为济贫院里的孤儿他得到了怎样宽厚的待遇。他们也得知他是一个忘恩负义的、危险的孩子，粗暴地殴打了另一个孩子，最后终于从他干活的人家逃跑了。</p>
<p>The old gentleman shook his head sadly and gave Mr Bumble the five pounds. 'I would have been happy to give you three times the amount if your story had proved that the boy was good. '</p>
<p>老先生伤心地摇了摇头，给了班布尔先生五个英镑。“我会很高兴给你三倍的钱——假如你说的事能证明他是个好孩子。”</p>
<p>If Mr Bumble had known this earlier, he might have told a different story, but now it was too late. So he took the money and left.</p>
<p>如果班布尔早知道是这样的话，他说的可能会与刚才说的完全不一样，可现在已为时太晚了。他只好拿了钱，离开了。</p>
<p>Mr Brown low walked up and down his room for several minutes, deep in thought. He rang the bell for Mrs Bed win, his housekeeper, and told her what he had heard.</p>
<p>有几分钟工夫，布朗洛先生在屋里来回地踱着步，陷入了深思。他拉铃叫来了贝德温太太，他的女管家，把他所听到的事告诉了她。</p>
<p>'I don't believe it, 'she said, with great certainty.</p>
<p>“我不相信这些。”她非常肯定地说。</p>
<p>'I was right, 'said Mr Grimwig with satisfaction. 'You should have listened to what I said. '</p>
<p>“我说的是对的。”格里姆威格先生满意地说，“你本应该听我的话。”</p>
<p>Mr Brown low said angrily, 'Never let me hear the boy's name again. Never. Remember that, Mrs Bed win. '</p>
<p>布朗洛先生气愤地说：“以后别再让我听到这孩子的名字，永远不要。记住了吗，贝德温太太？”</p>
<p>The re were sad hearts at Mr Brown low 's house that night.</p>
<p>那天晚上，布朗洛先生家里的人心里都很悲伤。</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in another part of London, Oliver remained a prisoner. Fagin had told Oliver how ungrateful he had been to run away. He had told him that he would have died of hunger without Fagin's kindness. He went on to tell Oliver the story of another young boy, who had gone to the police to tell the m about the gang, but who had finally been hanged one morning for being a thief. Fagin described the hanging in terrifying detail, and said that he hoped he would never have to tell the police about Oliver—and see Oliver with a rope around his neck. Oliver felt his blood turn cold.</p>
<p>与此同时，在伦敦的另一个地方，奥利弗像个囚犯一样被关着。费金已告诉他，逃跑是件忘恩负义的事。他还说，若不是自己对他仁慈，奥利弗本来是会饿死的。他又告诉了奥利弗另一个小男孩的事。这个孩子到警察局告发了他的同伙，结果在一天早晨作为小偷被送上了绞刑架。费金详细地形容了绞刑的恐怖。他说，希望他自己永远不会被迫到警察那儿去告发奥利弗——也不愿看到绞索套在奥利弗的脖子上。奥利弗这时感到浑身的血液都凝固了。</p>
<p>He remained locked in a room for many days, seeing nobody between early morning and midnight. He spent his time thinking sadly about his friends in Pentonville. After a week he was free to wander round the house during the day. It was a dirty place, full of rats and insects but no other living thing. All the windows were closed, and covered with wood and metal bars that kept out the light.</p>
<p>他被锁在小屋里许多天，每天从清早到午夜见不到一个人，他的时间都是在苦苦思念他在本顿维尔的朋友中度过的。一星期后，他白天从小屋里被放出来，只能在屋子里转来转去。这是个很脏的地方，除了老鼠和虫子外，没有其它活物。所有的窗户都是紧闭着的，上面还钉了许多木板和铁棍，亮光透不进来。</p>
<p>One afternoon the Dodger and Charley Bates were at home and They started telling Oliver about their lives as thieves.</p>
<p>一天下午，神偷和查理&middot;贝茨在屋里没出去，他们同奥利弗聊起了他们的小偷生涯。</p>
<p>'Why don't you become one? 'Charley asked him. 'We all are here—both of us, and Fagin, Sikes, Nancy…all of us.</p>
<p>“你为什么不也当个小偷？”查理问他，“我们都在一起——我们俩，还有费金，赛克斯，南希，我们都在一起。”</p>
<p>'I don't want to be, 'replied Oliver. 'I wish They'd let me go.</p>
<p>“我不想，”奥利弗回答道，“我真希望他们能放我走。”</p>
<p>'But it's a good life, 'the Dodger said, taking some coins from his pocket and throwing the m up in the air. 'What does it matter where the money comes from? 'he said, laughing. 'If you don't steal it, someone else will. You can be sure of that! '</p>
<p>“可是这种日子很舒服。”神偷说着从兜里掏出了几个硬币抛向空中。“管他钱是从哪儿来的呢！”他笑着说，“你不去偷，别人也会去的。这是毫无疑问的！”</p>
<p>Fagin entered at this point, with two young men, and joined in the conversation. One of The young men had just come out of prison, and the re were many cheerful jokes about his very short hair-cut. Everybody sat around the fire, talking and laughing for hours Fagin told Oliver how good the Dodger was at his job, and what a friendly boy Charley was. It was, without doubt, an interesting evening for Oliver, after so many days locked up alone.</p>
<p>正在这时，费金与另外两个年轻人走了进来，参加谈天，其中的一个年轻人是刚从监狱里出来的。大家拿他剃得很短的头发开着玩笑。几个小时里，大家围着火炉坐着，又说又笑。费金告诉奥利弗，神偷干得多么巧妙，查理又是个多么友好的孩子。被独自锁在小屋多日之后的今天对奥利弗来说无疑是很有趣的。</p>
<p>After that evening he was rarely on his own again. He spent a lot of time with the Dodger and Charley, and often played the hand kerchief game with the m. At other times Fagin would tell the m all about robberies he had committed in his younger days, telling the stories so well and putting in so many funny details that Oliver could not stop laughing, even though he knew it was wrong.</p>
<p>从那天晚上起，他很少一个人待着了，总是同神偷和查理在一起，常常同他们做着手帕的游戏。有时，费金给他们讲他年轻时干过的一些盗窃的事。他维妙维肖地说着事情滑稽的细节，奥利弗虽然心里明白这都是坏事，但还是不停地大笑着。</p>
<p>Fagin knew what he was doing. He had made sure that Oliver was so lonely and miserable that he would be desperate for any friends, however criminal. Slowly and deliberately, Fagin was trying to poison The young boy's mind.</p>
<p>费金很清楚他在干什么。他知道奥利弗很孤独、很痛苦，迫切需要朋友，哪怕是做罪犯的朋友。费金在试图慢慢地、有计划地毒害这孩子的心灵。</p>
<p>One damp, cold, windy night a few weeks later, Fagin put on his heavy coat and, with the collar pulled up high to hide his face, left his home. He walked fast through the streets, never losing his way even in the darkest places. Finally, he reached an evil, narrow street lit only by a single lamp. He knocked on a door, said something quietly to the person who opened it, the n walked upstairs.</p>
<p>几星期后一个寒冷、潮湿又刮着大风的晚上，费金穿上厚厚的大衣，竖起衣领，把整个脸都遮住，离开了家。他快步穿过几条街，甚至在一些最漆黑的地方，他也准确无误地走着。最后，他走进了一条只亮着一盏路灯的邪恶、狭窄的街道。他在一扇门上敲了几下，小声和来开门的人咕哝了几句，便走进去上了楼。</p>
<p>Bill Sikes was sitting by his fire with his dog when Fagin entered. The room was a small, dark place with almost no furniture. Nancy was the re, too, and Fagin glanced at her uneasily. He had not seen her since she had attacked him to stop him hitting Oliver. However, she seemed to have forgotten all about it, because she told him to pull up a chair and warm himself by the fire.</p>
<p>费金进去时，比尔&middot;赛克斯和他的狗正坐在火炉旁。这间房子昏暗、狭小，几乎没有什么家具。南希也在这儿，费金不自在地瞟了她一眼。自从上次她向他扑来，阻止他殴打奥利弗之后，他一直没再见到她。可她却好像早已把那件事忘得一干二净了。她让他拿过一把椅子，在炉火旁暖暖身子。</p>
<p>'I'm ready for business, 'Bill Sikes said, looking at Fagin suspiciously. 'Say what you have to say, Fagin. '</p>
<p>“我已经准备好做交易了，”比尔&middot;赛克斯多疑地看着费金说，“你有什么要说的就说吧，费金。”</p>
<p>'It's about the robbery at Chertsey, Bill, 'answered Fagin. 'Some lovely silver in that house down the re! '</p>
<p>“是关于到切特赛盗窃的事，比尔，”费金回答说，“在那边那所房子里有一些漂亮的银制器皿！”</p>
<p>'I know, I know, 'Sikes said. 'I was down the re two nights ago to have a look at the house. But it's locked like a prison at night, all except one part. '</p>
<p>“我知道，我知道。”赛克斯说，“两天前的夜里，我过去看过那房子。到了晚上，那里简直像监狱一样锁得死死的，只有一个地方防备不严。”</p>
<p>'Where's that? 'asked Fagin, bending his head forwards, his eyes staring excitedly at Sikes.</p>
<p>“那是哪儿？”费金问，并把头往前伸了伸，兴奋地盯着赛克斯看。</p>
<p>'Do you think I'm stupid? I'm not telling you! Anyway, what we need is a boy. '</p>
<p>“你以为我傻啊？我才不告诉你呢！不管怎么说，我们需要有一个孩子。”</p>
<p>'So the re's a small place where only a boy can enter the house? 'asked Fagin.</p>
<p>“那么，是不是有个小地方，只有孩子才能从那里钻进去？”费金问。</p>
<p>'Maybe. But we need a boy. '</p>
<p>“也许吧。反正我们需要一个小男孩。”</p>
<p>The re was silence for a time, while Fagin thought. The n he made a sign to Sikes to tell Nancy to leave the room.</p>
<p>费金在考虑着，半天没人吱声。然后他给赛克斯递了一个眼神，暗示他先让南希出去。</p>
<p>'Don't worry, Sikes said. 'You can trust her—she won't talk. Isn't that right? '</p>
<p>“别担心，”赛克斯说，“你可以信得过她——她不会走漏风声的。是吧？”</p>
<p>'Of course it's right, 'answered The young woman, taking a large drink from the bottle on the table, and laughing. 'Anyway, Fagin, I know your idea is for Oliver to do the job. '</p>
<p>“那还用说。”年轻的女人说着，拿起桌上的瓶子喝了一大口，然后大笑起来。“不管怎样，费金，我知道你的心思。你是想让奥利弗去干这件事。”</p>
<p>'You're a clever girl, said Fagin, smiling evilly. 'That's exactly what I had in mind. Listen, Bill—the boy's been training for a few weeks, and it's time he did some work. He's the smallest one, anyway. '</p>
<p>“你真是个聪明的姑娘。”费金说道，邪恶地笑着。“这正是我的意思。听着，比尔——这孩子已经练了好几个星期了，该到他出力干活的时候了，再说他也是最瘦小的。”</p>
<p>'Is he safe? 'asked Sikes. 'Because if he tries any tricks on me, I'll kill him! '</p>
<p>“他保险吗？”赛克斯问，“他要是跟我耍花招，我会杀了他的。”</p>
<p>'He'll be ours for life, if he feels he's one of us. And this job will make him feel like that, 'said Fagin eagerly. 'The boy looks so innocent he's perfect. And we've got to include him in some crime as soon as we can. Otherwise, if he escapes now, he can tell the police about us and stay free himself. '</p>
<p>“如果他觉得他是我们自己人的话，他会一辈子都听我们的。而这次行动就会使他产生这种感觉。”费金急切地说。“这孩子看上去很单纯，他是最理想不过的人眩我们必须尽快让他和我们一起进行一次犯罪行动，否则，他一旦跑了，到警察局告发了我们，他自己还可以不进监狱的。”</p>
<p>So it was decided that Oliver would help Sikes with the robbery in two days' time. The plan was discussed in great detail and all the arrangements made. By the n, Sikes was very drunk, and Fagin got up to leave. As he put on his coat, he stared hard at Nancy, frowning a little. No, he was sure he could trust her; she was loyal.</p>
<p>就这样，奥利弗被选定协助赛克斯在两天之后去干这件入室盗窃的事。这次行动的计划经过了非常周密的讨论，各项准备工作都做好了。到这时，赛克斯已喝得酩酊大醉了。费金站起身来要走，他穿大衣时，死死地盯着南希看，皱了皱眉头。不，他肯定他是可以信任她的，她很忠诚。</p>
<p>The next night, Oliver was alone in Fagin's house when Nancy entered. She was so nervous and white-faced that Oliver asked her if she was ill.</p>
<p>第二天夜里，奥利弗独自待在费金的家里，这时南希来了。她惊恐万分，脸色发白，因此奥利弗问她是否不舒服。</p>
<p>'God forgive me! 'she said, beating her hand s togethe r. 'I never thought I would do this! '</p>
<p>“上帝饶恕我！”她双手直拍巴掌，说道，“我没想到我会这么做！”</p>
<p>'Has anything happened? 'asked the boy. 'What is it? '</p>
<p>“出事了吗？”男孩问，“什么事？”</p>
<p>She sat with her back to him, and hid her face with her hand s. After a while she said, 'I don't know why I feel so strange sometimes. Come on, Oliver—are you ready? You have to come with me to Bill's house. '</p>
<p>她背对着他坐下，用双手蒙住脸。一会儿，她说：“我不明白为什么，我有时有这种奇怪的感觉。快走，奥利弗——你准备好了吗？你必须现在跟我到比尔那里去。”</p>
<p>'Why? '</p>
<p>“什么事？”</p>
<p>'Oh—nothing important. '</p>
<p>“嗯，没什么要紧事。”</p>
<p>Oliver did not believe her, but he thought that at last this might be an opportunity to escape. So he said, rather too quickly, 'I'm ready. 'Nancy guessed what he was thinking.</p>
<p>奥利弗不相信她的话，可他想终于可能得到一个逃跑的好机会了，因此他未免太快地回答说：“我准备好了。”南希猜到他在想什么。</p>
<p>'Oliver, 'she said, 'this is not the time to escape. I've saved you once, and I will again, but if anything happens tonight, it might mean my death. 'She said this so seriously that Oliver decided it must be true. He was quiet while They walked quickly through the streets to Sikes' house.</p>
<p>“奥利弗，”她说，“这次不是你逃走的时候，我救过你一次，我还会这么做的。但是，如果今儿晚上出了什么事，那就可能意味着我得去死。”她非常认真地说着这番话，奥利弗想，这一定是真的。一路上他一声不响，快步地朝前走着，穿过街道，直奔赛克斯家。</p>
<p>Inside his room, Sikes sat Oliver down on a chair. 'Did he come quietly? 'he asked Nancy.</p>
<p>进了屋，赛克斯让奥利弗坐在椅子上，“他一路上安静吗？”他问南希。</p>
<p>'Quiet as a mouse. '</p>
<p>“安静得像只小老鼠。”</p>
<p>'Glad to hear it, 'said Sikes. 'Now listen to me, boy. 'He put a gun against Oliver's head. If you say one word when you're outside with me, I'll shoot you. Understand? '</p>
<p>“很高兴听到这个。”赛克斯说。“孩子，现在听我说，”他把一支枪顶在奥利弗脑门上，“你跟我出去时，假如说一句话，我就开枪打死你，明白了吗？”</p>
<p>Oliver nodded, trying hard not to tremble.</p>
<p>奥利弗不停地点着头，尽量不使自己发抖。</p>
<p>Sikes and Oliver started out at five o'clock in the morning, while it was still dark. They crossed from one side of London to the other. At first the streets were empty, the n shopsbegan to open and people started going to work. Gradually, the noise and traffic increased, and as They passed through the meat market at Smithfield, Oliver was amazed by the sight and smells of so many animals, and by the huge crowds of people, all pushing and swearing and shouting. But Bill Sikes marched on without stopping．</p>
<p>早晨5点钟，赛克斯和奥利弗出发了。这时，天色还很黑，他们横穿伦敦，从一头走到另一头。刚开始时街道上还是空荡荡的，过了一会儿店铺开始开张，人们开始去工作了。渐渐地，嘈杂声越来越大，车马越来越多，他们穿过史密斯菲尔德的肉市时，奥利弗被那里各种牲畜的形象和气味，还有那熙熙攘攘推搡着、咒骂着、叫喊着的人群惊呆了。可比尔&middot;赛克斯却大步地朝前走着，一刻不停。</p>
<p>Later in the day They were given a lift in a horse and cart from west London out into the country. Night fell, and after walking a few more miles down country roads, They finally arrived at an old house standing alone by a river. It was dark and seemed to be empty They went inside without knocking.</p>
<p>那天晚些时候，他们搭上了一辆从伦敦西部往乡间去的马车。夜幕降临，又走了几英里的乡间小路，他们终于到达了坐落在一条河边的一幢古老房屋。屋里黑着灯，好像没人。他们没敲门就照直走了进去。</p>
<p>Inside were two other men, who, at Sikes command, produced food and drink for him and the boy. The n Sikes told Oliver to get some sleep as They would be going out again later that night. Oliver still had no idea of the purpose of this expedition, but his head ached with tiredness and he soon fell asleep.</p>
<p>里面有两个男人，他们在赛克斯的指令下，为他和男孩子送上了吃的喝的。吃过饭后，赛克斯让奥利弗去睡一会儿，因为这天深夜他们还得出去。到现在为止，奥利弗还不知道这次远行的目的，可他累得头痛，马上就睡着了。</p>
<p>At half past one the men got up and checked their equipment, gathering several sticks as well. Sikes and the man called Toby left the house togethe r, with Oliver walking between the m. The re was now a thick fog and the night was very still as They hurried through the deserted streets of the nearby town. Out in the country again, They walked down several small roads until finally They stopped at a house surrounded by a high wall. As quick as lightning, Toby climbed up and pulled Oliver after him. Inside the garden, They crept towards the house, and now, for the first time, Oliver realized in horror that the purpose of the expedition was robbery, and maybe even murder.</p>
<p>差不多一点半，人们就起来了，检查了一下他们的工具，还把几根木棍收集在一起。赛克斯和那个叫托比的人一起离开了这幢房子，奥利弗走在他们两人中间。夜晚雾很大，四周非常安静，他们匆匆地穿行在附近小镇子荒僻的街道上。不久，他们又到了乡间，走完几条小道，最后停在了一座被一道高墙围着的房屋前。比尔闪电般地爬上了墙，随后把奥利弗也拉了上去。到了花园里，他们蹑手蹑脚地向屋子靠近。直到现在，奥利弗才万般惊恐地知道了这次远行的目的是入室盗窃，很有可能还会谋财害命。</p>
<p>Bill Sikes broke open a small window at the back of the house, the n shone his light into Oliver's face.</p>
<p>比尔&middot;赛克斯打破房子后面的一个小窗户，然后把手中的灯光射在了奥利弗的脸上。</p>
<p>'Now listen. I'm going to put you through here．Go straight through into the hall and on to the front door, and let us in. And if you don't, you can be sure I'll shoot you．'</p>
<p>“听着，我从这儿把你放进去，你一直往前走，穿过大厅，到前门把我们放进去，如果你不照着我说的去做，你可以肯定我是会开枪打死你的。”</p>
<p>Oliver, stupid with terror, was lifted through the window into the house. Desperately, he decided to try to run upstairs and warn the family. He began to creep forwards.</p>
<p>奥利弗被吓傻了。他被举起来，钻过窗子，进到房里。他万般无奈，决定设法跑上楼，通知房主。他开始蹑手蹑脚地朝前走。</p>
<p>Suddenly, the re was a loud noise from the hall.</p>
<p>突然，厅里传来了一声很响的动静。</p>
<p>'Come back! ' shouted Sikes. 'Back! Back! '</p>
<p>“回来！”赛克斯喊着，“回来！回来！”</p>
<p>Oliver stood still, frozen with fear. A light appeared, the n two men on the stairs, the m a sudden bright flash, and a loud bang. Oliver staggered back. Sikes seized the boy's collar through the window and pulled him back out into the garden.</p>
<p>奥利弗站在那儿一动不动，给吓呆了。一盏灯亮起来，两个男人出现在楼梯上，接着是一道闪光和砰的一响。奥利弗踉踉跄跄退了几步。赛克斯将手伸进窗户，抓住奥利弗的衣领，将他从屋里揪到院子里。</p>
<p>'They've hit him! ' shouted Sikes. 'He's bleeding. '</p>
<p>“他们打中他了！”赛克斯喊道，“他在流血。”</p>
<p>A bell rang loudly, above the noise of more gunshots and the shouts of men. Oliver felt himself being carried across rough ground, and the n he saw and heard no more</p>
<p>一阵响亮的铃声压过了枪声和人的呐喊声。奥利弗觉得自己被人扛着跑过高低不平的地面，然后就对什么也没有知觉了。</p><a href='8.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
