<p><b>3 奥利弗到伦敦去 </b></p>
<p>Oliver was now officially an undertaker’s assistant．It was a good，sickly time of year，and coffins were selling well. Oliver gained a lot of experience in a short time，and was interested to see how brave some people were after a death in the family. During funerals for some rich people， for example，he saw that the people who had cried the loudest in church usually recovered the fastest afterwards．He noticed how in other wealthy families the wife or the husband often seemed quite cheerful and calm despite the recent death-just as if nothing had happened．Oliver was very surprised to see all this， and greatly admired the m for controlling their sadness so well.</p>
<p>奥利弗现已是棺材店老板的正式助理，这一年年景很好，疾病成灾，棺材生意兴旺。在不长的时间里他就积累了许多经验。他很有兴趣地发现有些人在家里死了人时表现得沉着勇敢。比如说，他发现在一些有钱人的葬礼上，在教堂里哭声最大的人往往都是事后恢复最快的人。他注意到，还有一些富人家，尽管刚刚死了人，但无论死者的妻子还是丈夫，都显得轻松愉快、镇定自若——好像什么都没发生过一样。奥利弗对这些感到不可理解，对他们能很好地克制悲伤不流露于外佩服极了。</p>
<p>He was treated badly by most of the people around him．Noah was jealous because Oliver went out to burials while he was left back in the shop，so he treated him even worse than before．Charlotte treated him badly because Noah did. And Mrs Sowerberry was his enemy because Mr Sowerberry was supposed to be his friend.</p>
<p>他身边的人大都待他极不好。诺厄十分妒忌奥利弗，因为他能出去参加葬礼，而自己却被留在店铺里，所以比以前更加残酷地对待他。夏洛特对他不好，是因为诺厄对他坏。索尔贝里太太跟他是对头，是因为她认为索尔贝里先生是他的朋友。</p>
<p>One day something happened which might seem unimportant，but which had a great effect on Oliver’s future. Noah was in a particularly bad mood one dinner-time，and so he tried to make Oliver cry by hitting him，pulling his hair，and calling him horrible names. This was all unsuccessful， so he tried personal insults．</p>
<p>一天，发生了一件本来看起来好像不很重要的事，可这事对奥利弗的未来却产生了很大的影响。晚餐时，诺厄的心情特别不好，他成心想弄哭奥利弗，就打他，揪他的头发，用各种坏话骂他，但这都无济于事。他便对他进行人格侮辱。</p>
<p>‘Workhouse， how’s your mother？’ he asked．</p>
<p>“济贫院，你妈妈呢？”他问道。</p>
<p>‘She’s dead，’replied Oliver，his face going red with emotion．</p>
<p>“她死了，”奥利弗回答说，由于感情激动，他的脸变红了。</p>
<p>Noah hoped that Oliver was going to cry， so he continued．‘What did she die of， Workhouse？’</p>
<p>诺厄想让奥利弗哭出来，就接着问：“她是怎么死的，济贫院？”</p>
<p>‘Of a broken heart， I was told．’And a tear rolled down Oliver’s cheek.</p>
<p>“有人告诉我她是伤心死的。”一颗泪珠从奥利弗的脸上滚落下来。</p>
<p>‘Why are you crying，Workhouse？’</p>
<p>“你怎么哭了，济贫院？”</p>
<p>Oliver remained silent，and Noah grew braver． ‘You know，I feel very sorry for you，Workhouse，but the truth is your mother was a wicked woman．’</p>
<p>奥利弗不吭声，诺厄胆子大了，更加得寸进尺：“你知道我很同情你，济贫院，但你妈妈其实是个坏女人。”</p>
<p>Oliver seemed suddenly to wake up. ‘What did you say？’</p>
<p>奥利弗好像猛一激灵。“你说什么？”</p>
<p>‘She was so bad it was lucky she died， or she would have ended up in prison，or hung.’</p>
<p>“她太坏了，所以死了倒是件好事，否则她最后会被关进监狱或处以绞刑的。”</p>
<p>His face bright red with anger，Oliver jumped up， seized Noah’s throat， and shook the older boy so violently that his teeth nearly fell out. The n he hit him with all his strength and knocked him to the ground．</p>
<p>奥利弗的脸由于气愤而涨得通红。他猛地跳了起来，一把掐住诺厄的喉咙，拼命地摇着那大孩子，差点儿把他的牙齿都摇掉了。接着，他使出全身的力气一拳将他打倒在地。</p>
<p>‘He’ll murder me！’screamed Noah． ‘Charlotte！ Help！Oliver’s gone mad—’</p>
<p>“他会弄死我的！”诺厄尖声叫喊着，“夏洛特！救命！奥利弗疯了……”</p>
<p>Charlotte and Mrs Sowerberry ran in and screamed in horror．They took hold of Oliver and began to heat him． The n Noah got up and started to kick him from behind．When They were all tired， They forced Oliver， who was still fighting and shouting， into the cellar and locked it．</p>
<p>夏洛特和索尔贝里太太跑了进来，害怕得尖叫起来。他们抓住奥利弗拳脚相加。这时诺厄才从地上爬了起来，从背后抬脚猛踢他。直到他们都打累了，他们才将仍在反抗的奥利弗推进地下室，锁了起来。</p>
<p>Mrs Sowerberry sat down， breathing heavily． ‘He’s like a wild animal！’she said． ‘We could all have been murdered in our beds！’</p>
<p>索尔贝里太太坐下来，喘着粗气说：“他简直像头野兽！我们都有可能被他害死在床上。”</p>
<p>‘I hope Mr Sowerberry doesn’t take any more of the se dreadful creatures from the workhouse，’said Charlotte． ‘Poor Noah was nearly killed！’Mrs Sowerberry looked at Noah sympathetically.</p>
<p>“我真不希望索尔贝里先生再从济贫院里带来这种可怕的东西，”夏洛特说，“可怜的诺厄差点儿被掐死！”索尔贝里太太表示同情地看着诺厄。</p>
<p>Noah， who was twice Oliver’s size， pretended to rub tears from his eyes．</p>
<p>诺厄是奥利弗身材的两倍，这会儿他正假装擦着眼泪。</p>
<p>‘What shall we do？’ cried Mrs Sowerberry． ‘He’ll kick that door down in ten minutes.’ They could hear Oliver banging and kicking at the cellar door． ‘Noah-run and get Mr Bumble．’</p>
<p>“我们该怎么办？”索尔贝里太太叫喊着，“用不了十分钟他就会把那扇门踢破的。”他们能听见地下室里奥利弗咚咚的敲门踹门声。“诺厄——快去把班布尔先生找来。”</p>
<p>So Noah ran through the streets as quickly as he could to fetch the beadle． When he reached the workhouse， he waited for a minute to make sure his face was suitably tearful and frightened.</p>
<p>诺厄尽可能快地跑着，穿过了几条街道，去叫执事。他来到了济贫院，先在外面站了一会儿，好确实做到自己的脸上有适当的泪痕和害怕的样子。</p>
<p>As soon as Mr Bumble came out，Noah cried， ‘Mr Bumble！Mr Bumble！ It’s Oliver Twist，sir．He’s become violent．He tried to murder me， sir！ And Charlotte， and Mrs Sowerberry as well.’</p>
<p>班布尔先生从屋里一出来，诺厄就喊了起来：“班布尔先生！班布尔先生！又是奥利弗&middot;特威斯特闹事了。他动手打人，想弄死我，先生！还想害死夏洛特和索尔贝里太太。”</p>
<p>Mr Bumble was shocked and angry． ‘Did he？I’ll come up the re immediately and beat him with my stick．’</p>
<p>班布尔先生大为震惊，他非常生气。“是吗？我立刻就去，我要用我的手杖狠狠地揍他。”</p>
<p>When he arrived at the shop，Oliver was still kicking wildly at the cellar door.</p>
<p>他来到棺材店时，奥利弗还在发疯似地踹着地下室的门。</p>
<p>‘Let me out！’he shouted from the cellar，when he heard Mr Bumble’s voice． ‘I’m not afraid of you！’</p>
<p>“让我出去！”他听到了班布尔先生的声音时，在地下室叫喊着，“我不怕你！”</p>
<p>Mr Bumble stopped for a moment，amazed and even rather frightened by this change in Oliver． The n he said to Mrs Sowerberry， ‘It’s the meat that’s caused this， you know.’</p>
<p>班布尔先生稍稍站了一会儿，他对奥利弗的变化很吃惊，甚至很有点害怕。然后他对索尔贝里太太说：“这就是肉食造成的结果，你知道。”</p>
<p>‘What？’</p>
<p>“什么？”</p>
<p>‘Meat， madam. You’ve fed him too well here. Back in the workhouse this would never have happened.’</p>
<p>“肉，太太，你这里给他吃得太好了。在济贫院里是从来不会发生这种事的。”</p>
<p>‘I knew I was too generous to him，’said Mrs Sowerberry，raising her eyes to the ceiling．</p>
<p>“我知道我对他是太厚道了，”索尔贝里太太抬起眼睛看着天花板，说道。</p>
<p>At that moment Mr Sowerberry returned and，hearing what had happened（according to the ladies）， he beat Oliver so hard that even Mr Bumble and Mrs Sowerberry were satisfied． Mr Sowerberry was not a cruel man，but he had no choice. He knew that if he didn’t punish Oliver， his wife would never forgive him．</p>
<p>就在这时，索尔贝里先生从外面回来了，他知道了发生的一切（是从女人们的嘴里听说的），就狠狠地打了奥利弗一顿，以至于班布尔先生和索尔贝里太太都感到满意了。索尔贝里先生不是个狠心的人，可他没有别的办法，他很清楚，假如他不惩罚奥利弗，他老婆是不会饶过他的。</p>
<p>That night， alone in the room with the coffins，Oliver cried bitter， lonely tears． He did not sleep， and very early in the morning， before anyone was awake， he quietly unlocked the shop door and left the house． He ran up the street and through the town as far as the main road，where he saw a sign that told him it was just seventy miles from the re to London. The name London gave the boy an idea．That huge place！ Nobody， not even Mr Bumble， could ever find him the re！He had heard old men in the workhouse say it was a good place for brave boys，and that the re was always work the re for those that wanted it．It would be the best place for him．He jumped to his feet and walked forward again．</p>
<p>那天晚上，一个人呆在棺材房里，奥利弗哭了，流下了辛酸、孤单的眼泪。他一夜没睡，第二天一大早，趁着还没有一个人起床，便轻轻地打开了铺子的门，离开了这座房子。他沿街道跑下去，尽快地穿过镇子，直走到大路上。他看见一块牌子上写着“此地距伦敦七十英里整”。伦敦这个地名使这个孩子产生了一个念头。那是个极大的地方！在那儿没人能找到他，就连班布尔先生也找不到！在济贫院里他听老人们说过，那是个勇敢的孩子去的好地方，而且在那儿很容易找到事做。对他来说那将是最好的去处。他一跃而起，朝前走去。</p>
<p>But after only four miles he began to realize just how far he would have to walk． He stopped to think about it． He had a piece of bread， a rough shirt， two pairs of socks and a penny. But he could not see how the se would help him get to London any faster， so he continued walking．</p>
<p>但是刚刚走了四英里，他已开始意识到他还有多么长的路要走。他停下脚步，想了想这件事。他身边有一块面包、一件粗布衫、两双袜子和一便士。他看不出这些东西怎么能帮他更快地到达伦敦。于是，他继续往前走去。</p>
<p>He walked twenty miles that day． The only thing he had to eat was his piece of bread and some water which he begged from houses near the road. He slept the first night in a field，feeling lonely， tired， cold and hungry. He was even hungrier the next morning when he woke up， and he had to buy some more bread with his penny．That day he walked only twelve miles． His legs were so weak that They shook beneath him．</p>
<p>那一天，他走了二十英里，只吃了身边的那块面包，喝了点儿从路边人家讨来的水。第一天晚上他睡在了野地里，孤单、疲劳、寒冷、饥饿一起向他袭来。第二天早晨醒来，他更加饥饿难耐，不得不拿出仅有的一便士买了点儿面包。这一天他只走了十二英里，他的两条腿软弱无力，不停地瑟瑟发抖。</p>
<p>The next day he tried to beg for money， but large signs in some villages warned him that anyone caught begging would be sent to prison. Travellers on the road refused to give him money； They said he was a lazy young dog and didn’t deserve anything. Farmers threatened to send their dogs after him．When he waited outside pubs，the pub－owners chased him away because They thought he had come to steal something．Only two people were kind enough to feed him： an old woman and a gate－keeper on the road. If They had not given him some food， he surely would have died like his mother.</p>
<p>第三天，他不得不乞讨小钱了。但在一些村子，他能看到大的牌子，上面写着警告说，任何乞讨的人，一旦抓住后，将被送进监狱。路上的行人拒绝给他钱；他们说他是一条小懒狗，不应得到任何东西。农夫们威胁说要放出狗来追他。他站在小酒店外面时，酒店老板也要赶他走，因为他们认为他是来偷东西的。只有两个好心人给了他东西吃：一位老妇和一个路上的看门人。如果不是他们给他东西吃，他肯定会像他母亲一样死去的。</p>
<p>Early on the seventh morning of his journey， Oliver finally reached the little town of Barnet，just outside London. Exhausted，he sat down at the side of the road. His feet were bleeding and he was covered in dust． He was too tired even to beg．The n he noticed that a boy， who had passed him a few minutes before，had returned， and was now looking at him carefully from the opposite side of the road． After a long time the boy crossed the road and said to Oliver，</p>
<p>在旅途的第七天清早，奥利弗终于到达了伦敦附近一个叫巴尼特的小镇子。他精疲力竭地坐在路边，两只脚流着血，浑身上下沾满了尘土。由于过度疲劳，他连乞讨的劲儿都没有了，这时，他注意到有一个男孩几分钟之前从他身边走过，这会儿又折了回来，站在马路的对面仔细打量着他。过了好一会儿，这男孩穿过马路，向他走来，说：</p>
<p>‘Hello！ What’s the matter the n？’</p>
<p>“喂！怎么回事？”</p>
<p>The boy was about Oliver’s age， but was one of the strangest-looking people he had ever seen. He had a dirty，ordinary boy’s face， but he behaved as if he were an adult． He was short for his age and had little， sharp，ugly eyes. His hat was stuck on top of his head but it looked as though it would blow off at any minute． He wore a man’s coat which reached almost down to his feet， with sleeves so long that his hands were completely covered.</p>
<p>这男孩跟奥利弗年龄相仿，但奥利弗从未见过像他这样样子奇怪的人。他长着一张普通男孩的肮脏的脸，可他的一举一动跟大人一样。他比实际年龄要矮一点儿，一双贼溜溜的眯缝眼很难看。他的帽子就搁在脑袋顶上，看上去随时有可能被风吹掉。他身上穿了一件大人的外衣，衣服几乎拖到了脚背上。衣袖很长，几乎将他的两只手全盖在里面。</p>
<p>‘I’m very tired and hungry，’answered Oliver， almost crying． ‘I’ve been walking for a week．’</p>
<p>“我又累又饿，”奥利弗几乎是哭着回答说，“我走了整整一星期的路了。”</p>
<p>‘A week！ The magistrate’s order， was it？’</p>
<p>“一星期！是治安推事的命令吗？”</p>
<p>‘The magistrate？What’s that？’</p>
<p>“治安推事，是什么？”</p>
<p>‘A magistrate’s a kind of judge，’explained the surprised young gentleman. He realized Oliver did not have much experience of the world． ‘Never mind that．You want some food，’ he went on. ‘I haven’t got much money but don’t worry－I’ll pay．’</p>
<p>“治安推事是一种法官。”那位感到惊讶的年轻先生解释说。他明白了奥利弗涉世不深，没有多少经验。“别去管那些了。你现在需要吃点东西。”他接着说，“我身上没多少钱，但是别担心——我会付钱的。”</p>
<p>The boy helped Oliver to his feet， and took him to a pub. Meat， bread， and beer were placed before Oliver， and his new friend urged him to satisfy his hunger． While Oliver was eating， the strange boy looked at him from time to time with great attention．</p>
<p>这个男孩扶奥利弗站起来，带他走进一家小酒馆。肉、面包和啤酒摆在了奥利弗面前。他的新朋友催他快解除饥饿。奥利弗吃东西时，这个陌生的男孩不时注意地盯着他看。</p>
<p>‘Going to London？’ he asked him finally．</p>
<p>“去伦敦吗？”他最后问。</p>
<p>‘Yes.’</p>
<p>“是的。”</p>
<p>‘Got anywhere to live？’</p>
<p>“有地方住吗？”</p>
<p>‘No．’</p>
<p>“没有。”</p>
<p>‘Money？’</p>
<p>“有钱吗？”</p>
<p>‘No．’</p>
<p>“没有。”</p>
<p>The strange boy whistled， and put his arms into his pockets as far as the big coat sleeves would allow him． ‘I suppose you want to sleep somewhere tonight， don’t you？’</p>
<p>这陌生的男孩吹了声口哨，将两只手插进了衣袋里，直到宽大的衣袖挡住不能再插进去为止。“我想你今儿晚上得找个睡觉的地儿，是不是？”</p>
<p>‘I do，’ replied Oliver． ‘I haven’t slept under a roof since I started my journey．’</p>
<p>“是的。”奥利弗回答说，“这一路上我从来没在屋顶下睡过觉。”</p>
<p>‘Well， don’t worry．I’ve got to be in London tonight， and I know a very nice old gentleman the re who’ll let you live in his place and not even ask you for money！’</p>
<p>“别担心，今儿晚上我也得去伦敦。我认识那儿一个非常好的老先生，他会让你住在他那儿的，而且不要你的钱！”</p>
<p>Oliver was deeply grateful for this offer of shelter and talked for a long time with his new friend． His name was Jack Dawkins， but he was usually called ‘The Artful Dodger’． ‘Artful’ because he was very clever at getting what he wanted；and ‘Dodger’ because he was very good at not getting caught when he did something wrong．When he heard this，Oliver felt rather doubtful about having such a friend．However，he wanted first to meet the kind old gentleman in London，who would help him．After that，he could decide whether to continue the friendship with the Artful Dodger．</p>
<p>奥利弗对他能提供栖身之处深为感激，同他的新朋友聊了很长时间。他叫杰克&middot;道金斯，可人们都叫他“插翅神偷”。叫“神偷”是因为他能灵巧地得到他想要的东西；而“插翅”则是指他做了坏事时，善于及时逃脱不被抓获。奥利弗听到这儿，对有这样一个朋友感到拿不定主意。不管怎样，他先要见见在伦敦的这位好心的、会帮助他的老先生，之后再决定是否与插翅神偷继续他们的朋友关系。</p><a href='4.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
