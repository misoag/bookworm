<p><b>12 囚徒与国王 </b></p>
<p>We needed bad weather，but it was a fine，clear night．</p>
<p>我们需要坏天气，但那天却是个晴朗的夜晚。</p>
<p>At midnight Sapt，Fritz，and their men left and rode quietly through the woods towards the castle．If everything went well，they would get there at a quarter to two and wait for Johann to open the front door．If Johann did not open the door，Fritz would come round to the other side of the castle to find me．If I was not there，then I was dead-and the King，too！Sapt and his men would go back to Tarlenheim House and return with the Marshal and more men to get into the castle．</p>
<p>午夜时分，萨普特、弗里茨和他们的人骑马出发了。他们悄悄穿过树林奔向城堡。如果一切顺利的话，他们一点三刻会到达那儿，等待约翰打开大门。如果约翰没开门，弗里茨就绕到城堡的另一面来找我。要是我不在那儿，那我就是死了——国王也一样。萨普特和他的人就回塔伦汉姆庄园，然后随同元帅一起带着更多的人去攻打城堡。</p>
<p>So，half an hour later，I，too，left Tarlenheim．I took a shorter way than Sapt and when I reached the moat，I hid my horse in the trees，tied my rope round a strong tree and let myself down into the water．Slowly，I began to swim along under the castle walls．Just after a quarter to one，I came to the pipe and waited quietly in its shadow．Light was coming from Duke Michael's window opposite me across the moat，and I could see into the room．The next window along，which Johann had said was An-toinette's room，was dark．</p>
<p>于是，半小时以后我也离开了塔伦汉姆庄园。比起萨普特来我抄了一条近路。到了护城河，我在树林里藏好马，把绳子系在一棵粗壮的树上，然后下到水里。慢慢地，我开始沿着城墙游着，差一刻一点的时候，我到了排水管边，在阴影里静静等待。河对岸正对着我的是迈克尔公爵的房间，灯光从窗户里照射出来。我可以看见屋子里面旁边的那扇窗子，照约翰所说，就是安冬纳特的房间了。那间屋子是黑的。</p>
<p>Then the Duke's window opened，and Antoinette de Mauban looked out．Behind her there was a man．Rupert of Hentzau！What was he doing in the Duke's room？ I wondered．</p>
<p>这时公爵的窗子打开了，安&middot;德&middot;莫班向外看着，她的身边有个男人，亨佐的鲁帕特！他在公爵的房间里做什么？我真想知道。</p>
<p>Rupert tried to put his arm round Antoinette，but she moved quickly away．At that moment，I heard the door of the room open and then the angry voice of Duke Michael．</p>
<p>鲁帕特试图用胳膊去搂安冬纳特，可她很快挪开了。就在此时，我听见房门打开了，然后听见迈克尔公爵气冲冲的声音：</p>
<p>'What are you doing here？' he cried．</p>
<p>“你在这儿干嘛？”他叫道。</p>
<p>'Waiting for you，sir，'Rupert replied quickly．'I couldn't leave the lady alone．'</p>
<p>“等着你呢，先生。”鲁帕特很快回答。“我不能让这位女士一个人呆着。”</p>
<p>'Well，now you can go to bed．Are Detchard and Bersonin watching the prisoner？'</p>
<p>“那好吧，现在你可以去睡觉了。戴查德和伯索宁在看着囚犯吗？”</p>
<p>'Yes，sir．'</p>
<p>“是的，先生。”</p>
<p>A few minutes later，Rupert crossed the drawbridge and it was pulled up．The light in Duke Michael's room went out，but a light came on，and stayed on，in Antoinette's room．In the silent darkness，I waited．</p>
<p>几分钟以后，鲁帕特走过吊桥，然后吊桥拉了起来。迈克尔房间的灯灭了，但是安冬纳特屋子的灯亮了，而且一直亮着。在寂静的黑暗里，我等待着。</p>
<p>For about ten minutes everything was quiet，but suddenly I heard a noise on my side of the moat．A dark shape appeared in the gateway to the bridge，then turned and began to climb down some hidden steps in the wall．It was Rupert of Hentzau again-with a sword！Silently，he went down into the water and swam across the moat．Then he climbed out，and I heard him unlock the door．It was clear that Rupert of Hentzau had his own secret plans for that night．</p>
<p>大约过了十分钟什么声音也没有，可是突然我听到了在护城河我在的这一边有一点儿响动，一个黑影出现在通向吊桥的城门边，然后转过身开始顺着藏在墙里的台阶往下爬，是亨佐的鲁帕特，而且他手里还拿着剑！他悄悄地下到水里，游过护城河，然后爬了上去。我听见他打开了门锁。很显然，鲁帕特当夜也有他自己的秘密计划。</p>
<p>It was not yet time for Johann to open the front door for my friends，and I still had to wait．I climbed up to the gateway of the bridge and hid in a dark corner．Now no one could enter or leave the old castle without fighting me．I wondered what Rupert was doing now，and a few seconds later I found out．</p>
<p>现在还没有到约翰为我的朋友打开大门的时候，我还得等待。我从水里爬上对着吊桥的那座城门，在一个黑暗的角落里藏着。无论谁想进入老城堡或离开它，都得经过我这一关。我很想知道鲁帕特正在做什么。几秒钟后我就明白了。</p>
<p>There was a sudden crash，and then a woman's screams rang through the night． 'Help me，Michael！Rupert of Hentzau！'</p>
<p>突然响起了碰撞声，然后一个女人的尖叫在夜色中震响：“救救我，迈克尔！鲁帕特！”</p>
<p>Those were the words that I had written for Antoinette！But these were screams of real fear and soon I heard shouts and the sound of fighting from Antoinette's room．Then Rupert appeared at the window．His back was towards me，but he was fighting．'That's for you，Johann，' I heard him cry．Then，'Come on，Michael！'</p>
<p>这正是我要安冬纳特说的话。但那尖叫却带着真正的恐惧，而且立刻听见从女人房间传出叫喊和打斗声。然后鲁帕特出现在窗口，他的背冲着我，可他正和人格斗。“这一剑是给你的，约翰。”我听见他说。然后又说，“来吧，迈克尔！”</p>
<p>So Johann was in there too，fighting at the Duke's side！How could he open the door for Sapt now？</p>
<p>原来约翰也在那儿，站在公爵那边为公爵而战！现在他怎么可能去为萨普特开门？</p>
<p>More of the Duke's men had run to the room and the noise of the fighting grew louder．Suddenly，Rupert gave a wild laugh，and with his sword in his hand，jumped from the window into the moat below．</p>
<p>更多公爵的人冲进房间，厮杀声更响了。突然，鲁帕特狂笑一声，手里握着剑，从窗子里跳出来，跳进了下面的护城河。</p>
<p>At that moment the door of the old castle opened and De Gautet appeared beside me．I jumped at him with my sword，and a second later he fell dead in the doorway without a word or a sound．</p>
<p>正在这时，老城堡的门开了，德&middot;高蒂特出现在我身旁，我手握利剑向他跳过去，片刻之后他倒在门前死了，没能说出一个字或发出一点声响。</p>
<p>Wildly，I searched his body for the keys．I found them，and in a minute I was in the first room，where Bersonin and Detchard were．But there was only Bersonin in the room．Before he had time to realize that I was there，I had killed him．Detchard had run into the King's room and locked the door behind him．I ran at it to break it down．But would I be in time？Was the King already dead？</p>
<p>我疯了一样在他身上搜寻钥匙，我找到了。一瞬间我已经冲进了第一间屋子，伯索宁和戴查德呆着的那间屋子，但房间里只有伯索宁。还没等他明白过来我已经杀死了他。戴查德已经冲进了国王的房间，并从里面锁上了门。我冲上去砸开门。我还来得及吗？国王是不是已经死了？</p>
<p>The King was standing helplessly by the wall．But the doctor was also in the room and the brave little man had thrown himself at Detchard．He gave his life for the King，because，as I entered，Detchard pulled himself free and drove his sword into the doctor's side．Then，with an angry shout，Detchard turned to me．</p>
<p>国王正无助地站在墙边，那位医生也在里面，这个勇敢的小个子扑向戴查德，他为国王献出了自己的生命。等我冲进去时，戴查德已经挣脱出来，并将剑刺进医生的肋部，然后他怒喊一声转向我。</p>
<p>We fought long and hard．Detchard was an excellent swords-man，and I was growing tired．He drove me back against the wall，gave me a deep cut in the arm，and began to smile．In a second he would kill me．</p>
<p>我们打了很久，非常激烈。戴查德是位优秀的剑客，而我却越来越疲惫，他逼得我退到了墙边，在我的胳膊上深深地刺了一剑，然后开始微笑。很快他就能杀死我了。</p>
<p>Suddenly，the King realized who I was．</p>
<p>突然，国王认出了我是谁。</p>
<p>'Cousin Rudolf！'he cried．Then he picked up a chair and threw it at Detchard's legs．The Englishman，jumping to one side，turned his sword against the King，and with a cry the King fell to the ground．Detchard moved towards me again，stepped in the doctor's blood on the floor-and fell to the ground himself．I had him！A second later his body lay across the dead doctor．</p>
<p>“鲁道夫表弟！”他叫道。随即抄起一张椅子扔向戴查德的腿。那个英国人跳到了一边，将手里的剑刺向国王。国王叫了一声倒在地上。戴查德又转身向我。可这时他踩上了地板上医生的鲜血，自己倒在了地上。我赢了！片刻之间他的尸体就倒在死去的医生身上了。</p>
<p>But was the King dead？I had no time to find out，because just then I heard the noise of the drawbridge coming down．And that wild-cat Rupert of Hentzau was still alive．The King must wait for help while I fought his enemies．I ran out of the room and up the steps towards the drawbridge．And then I heard the sound of laughter-Rupert of Hentzau was laughing！</p>
<p>国王死了吗？我没时间去理会，因为就在此时我听到了吊桥放下的声音，而且那个如豹子般凶猛的鲁帕特还活着，国王只好等人来帮他的忙，我得去打败他的敌人。我冲出房间，跑上通往吊桥的台阶。然后我听见了笑声——鲁帕特在笑！</p>
<p>He was standing alone in the middle of the bridge．In the gateway on the far side stood a group of the Duke's men．They seemed too frightened to move．</p>
<p>他一个人站在吊桥中间，远处桥头城门那儿站着一群公爵的人，他们看上去太害怕了，动弹不得。</p>
<p>'Come out，Michael，you dog！' Rupert shouted．</p>
<p>“出来，迈克尔，你这条狗！”鲁帕特叫道。</p>
<p>But a woman's wild cry answered him．'He's dead！He's dead！'</p>
<p>可是一个女人的狂叫回答了他：“他死了！他死了！”</p>
<p>The men in the gateway moved to one side and a woman came forward．Her face was as white as her long dress，and her dark hair lay over her shoulders．In her hand she held a gun． The shot rang out，but she missed．Rupert laughed．Again An-toinette de Mauban faced him，her gun ready．But，before she could shoot，Rupert jumped over the side of the bridge， and down into the moat below．</p>
<p>城门旁的人挪向一旁，一个女人朝前走来，她的脸像她的长裙子一样白，她的黑头发披散在肩头，她手里端着一支枪，枪响了，但她没打中。鲁帕特笑了，安冬纳特又一次面向他，子弹上了镗，但在她开枪之前，鲁帕特越过桥边，跳进了下面的护城河。</p>
<p>At that moment I heard the sound of running feet inside the new castle- and the welcome voice of my old friend，Captain Sapt！Then I knew that the King was safe and needed me no more．I ran out on to the bridge and jumped down into the moat．I had business to finish with Rupert of Hentzau．</p>
<p>就在此时我听见了新城堡中有人奔跑的声响——还有我的老朋友萨普特上尉高兴的声音。我知道国王还活着，而且再也不需要我了。我冲过吊桥，也跳进了护城河。我跟鲁帕特还有账没算完。</p>
<p>I swam hard and caught up with him round the corner of the old castle．He had found my rope，climbed out of the moat， and was already running towards the trees where I had left my horse．</p>
<p>我拼命游着，在老城堡边上追上了他。他发现了我的绳子，爬出了护城河，正要跑向那片树林。树林里还有我的马。</p>
<p>I ran after him as fast as I could．He turned and saw me，and called out，laughing，'Why，it's the play-actor！'But then，with a cry of surprise，he found my horse，and in a minute he was on its back．</p>
<p>我尽全力追赶。他回身看见了我，笑着喊道：“嘿，是那位演员！”可就在此时，他惊喜地叫了一声，他看见了我的马，刹那间他已骑在马背上了。</p>
<p>'Get down！'I shouted．'Stand and fight，like a man！'</p>
<p>“下来！”我叫道：“站着跟我打，像条汉子！”</p>
<p>He turned，waiting for me，and I ran at him with my sword．For a few minutes we fought wildly．Blood ran from his face where I had cut it，but I had fought too many fights that night．He would surely kill me now．</p>
<p>他转过身来，等着我。我握着剑冲过去，一转眼我们就疯了似地打在一起了。他的脸上被我刺伤的地方血流了出来。但我那天晚上已经厮杀了好多次，现在他肯定会杀了我。</p>
<p>I was saved by Fritz，who came galloping round the castle to find me．When Rupert saw him coming，he knew he had no chance．</p>
<p>是弗里茨救了我。他骑马绕着城堡找我。当鲁帕特见他过来时，就明白没有机会了。</p>
<p>'Goodbye，Rudolf Rassendyll！'he called．'We'll meet again！'</p>
<p>“再见，鲁道夫&middot;拉森狄尔！”他说：“我们会再见面的！”</p>
<p>And he rode away into the forest，laughing and singing…and still alive．</p>
<p>然后他骑马跑进了树林，一边笑一边唱……他还活着。</p>
<p>I fell to the ground．Blood was running again from the cut in my arm，and I could not stand．Fritz jumped down from his horse and lifted me in his arms．</p>
<p>我倒在地上，血又从我胳膊上的伤口流出来，我站不住了。弗里茨跳下马抱起我。</p>
<p>'Dear friend！'he said．'Thank God I've found you！ When Johann did not come，we had to break down the castle door．We were afraid we would be too late．'</p>
<p>“亲爱的朋友！”他说：“感谢上帝我找到了你！约翰没来开门，我们只好砸开城堡的门。我们真担心太迟了。”</p>
<p>'And the King…？'I said．</p>
<p>“国王呢？”我问。</p>
<p>'Thanks to a very brave Englishman，'Fritz said gently，'the King is alive．'</p>
<p>“多亏了一位勇敢的英国人，”弗里茨轻柔地说，“国王还活着。”</p><a href='13.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
