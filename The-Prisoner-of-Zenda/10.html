<p><b>10 城堡外的一夜 </b></p>
<p>I wanted Duke Michael to think that I was still very ill，so we told the newspapers that the King had had a very serious accident．When Princess Flavia read this，she was very worried and she decided to come and see me．The Marshal could not stop her，and，although I was afraid for her，I was ex cited at the thought of seeing her again．We spent two wonderfully happy days together．</p>
<p>我想让迈克尔公爵以为我还十分虚弱，所以我们在报纸上说国王出了很严重的意外事故。当弗蕾维亚公主看到这条消息时，她非常忧虑，决定前来看我。元帅阻止不了她。虽然我替她担心，但也很高兴能再见到她。我们在一起过了幸福的两天。</p>
<p>We had sent Johann back to the Castle of Zenda and suddenly we had a message from him．The real King was very ill．</p>
<p>我们派约翰回曾达的城堡去了。突然，我们得到了他传来的一个消息：真正的国王病得很重。</p>
<p>'I must save him，'I said to myself．'I love Flavia more each day．I can't go on like this much longer．'</p>
<p>“我得救他。”我对自己说，“我对弗蕾维亚的爱每天都在增加，我没法儿再这样继续下去了。”</p>
<p>I talked to Sapt．He agreed，so we made our plans．</p>
<p>我和萨普特谈了我的想法，他同意了。我们就决定了行动计划。</p>
<p>Late the next night，Sapt，Fritz，and I，with six more men，rode out towards the Castle of Zenda．Sapt was carrying a long rope and I had a short，thick stick and a long knife．</p>
<p>第二天深夜，萨普特、弗里茨和我，还有另外六个人，骑马向曾达城堡进发。萨普特带着一根长绳，我拿着一根又短又粗的棍子和一把长刀。</p>
<p>The night was dark，and it was wet and windy．We stayed away from the town and we met no one．When we came to the moat，we stopped near some trees and the six men hid there with the horses．Then Sapt tied the rope round one of the trees near the water．I pulled off my boots，put the stick between my teeth and gently went down the rope into the water．I was going to take a look at the pipe．</p>
<p>夜色很黑，空气潮湿。我们绕开城市前进，没有撞上什么人。我们来到护城河的附近，在树丛里停了下来，那六个人和我们的马藏在里面。然后萨普特把绳子系在水边的树上，我脱下靴子，用牙咬着棍子，轻轻地顺着绳子下到河里，我要去看一下那根排水管。</p>
<p>It had been warm and bright that day，and the water was not cold．Slowly and carefully I swam round the dark walls of the castle．There were lights in the new buildings，and from time to time I heard people shouting and laughing．'That must be young Rupert and his friends，'I thought．Suddenly a dark shape appeared in front of me．It was the pipe！The bottom of it was very wide and came out into the moat．And then I saw something which nearly made my heart stop．It was a boat， and in the boat there was a man！His gun was beside him，but，luckily，he was asleep．As quietly as I could，I moved closer． The man still slept．What could I do？ I had to save the King．I took out my knife and drove it through the sleeping man's heart！On the other side of the castle they were still singing．</p>
<p>那天很暖和，水也不冷。我缓慢而小心地绕着黑暗的城墙游着。城堡的新楼里有灯光，我不时能听见人们的叫声和笑声。“这一定是年轻的鲁帕特和他的同伙们。”我想。突然，一个黑影子出现在我的面前，是那根排水管！它的底部非常宽，伸进护城河里。然后我见到一样东西，我的心脏都几乎停止了跳动。是一只船，而且船里有个人！他的枪就靠在身边。幸运的是，他睡着了。我尽量轻轻地靠近他，他还在睡。我能怎么办呢？我得救出国王。我抽出刀，刺进了他的心脏。在城堡的另一边，那些人还在唱歌。</p>
<p>I had very little time．Someone could come at any minute．I looked up at where the pipe went through the wall into the prison．There was a thin line of light at the bottom edge．I heard Detchard's voice，and then I heard the King reply．Just then the light went out，and，in the darkness，I heard the King crying．I did not call to him．I had to get away safely- and take the body of the dead watchman with me．</p>
<p>我的时间很紧，随时可能有人会来，我看了看排水管穿过城墙进入监狱的地方，在那个地方的底端有一丝光亮透了出来。我听见了戴查德的声音。然后我听见了国王的回答。就在这时灯光灭了。在黑暗中我听到了国王的哭声。我没叫他。我必须安全地离开，而且得带上那个死去的哨兵。</p>
<p>I climbed into the boat and began to go back to where my friends were．No one could hear me because the wind was strong．But from somewhere behind me，I heard a shout．Someone was calling to the watchman．I reached the side of the moat where Sapt and Fritz were waiting．Quickly，I tied the rope round the man's body and Sapt and Fritz pulled it up．Then I climbed up the rope myself．</p>
<p>我爬进小船，开始往朋友们所在的地方划，没人能听见，因为风很大。但从我的背后，我听见一声叫唤，有人正在叫那个哨兵。我到了河边，萨普特和弗里茨正在等我。我很快地把绳子绕在那个哨兵的身上，他们把他拖了上去。然后我也顺着绳子爬了上去。</p>
<p>'Call our men from the trees，'I said quietly．'And hurry！'</p>
<p>“把我们的人叫来，”我悄声说。“要快！”</p>
<p>But just then，three men rode round from the front of the castle．Luckily，they did not see us，but they heard our six friends riding out of the trees，and with a shout they galloped towards them．</p>
<p>可就在此时，从城堡正面过来了三个骑马的人，很幸运他们没有看见我们，但他们听见了我们的六个朋友骑马从树林里出来，于是叫喊着扑向他们。</p>
<p>Seconds later we heard the sound of shots and I ran to help our men．Sapt and Fritz followed．</p>
<p>数秒钟后我们听见了枪声，我冲去帮助我们的人，萨普特和弗里茨紧跟着。</p>
<p>'Kill them！'cried a voice．It was Rupert of Hentzau．</p>
<p>“杀死他们！”一个声音叫着，是亨佐的鲁帕特。</p>
<p>'Too late！They've got both of us！'cried another voice．'Save yourself，Rupert！'</p>
<p>“太迟了，他们把我俩都抓住了，”另一个声音叫道：“快逃吧，鲁帕特！”</p>
<p>I ran on，holding my stick in my hand．Suddenly，through the darkness，I saw a horse coming towards me．I jumped at the horse's head，and saw the man's face above me．</p>
<p>我跑着，手里拿着棍子。突然，透过黑暗我看见一匹马向我这边冲来，我跳到了马头前，看见了我头顶上方那个人的脸。</p>
<p>'At last！'I shouted．'Rupert of Hentzau！'</p>
<p>“总算见面了！”我叫道：“亨佐的鲁帕特！”</p>
<p>He had only his sword，and my men were coming at him from one side，and Sapt and Fritz from the other．</p>
<p>他手里只有剑，我的人从一边向他靠近，萨普特和弗里茨从另一边向他靠近。</p>
<p>Rupert laughed．'It's the play-actor！'he cried，and with his sword he knocked my stick from my hand．Then he turned his horse，galloped to the moat，and jumped into the water with our bullets flying round his ears．Our men tried to shoot him in the water，but it was dark，there was no moon-and we lost him．</p>
<p>鲁帕特笑了。“原来是那位演员！”他叫道。他用剑打掉我的棍子，然后掉转马头，冲进了护城河。我们的子弹在他耳边飞舞，我们的人向水中射击，但天太黑了，没有月亮，他逃脱了。</p>
<p>We had killed two of the Six-Lauengram and Krafstein- but I was angry．Three of our brave friends were also dead， and we carried them home with a heavy heart．</p>
<p>我们杀死了那六个人中的两个——劳恩格兰姆和克拉夫斯坦，但我很生气，我们有三个勇敢的朋友死了，我们把他们的尸体带回去，心情很沉痛。</p>
<p>And I did not like to hear Rupert call me a play-actor．</p>
<p>我讨厌鲁帕特管我叫“演员”。</p>
<p>Of course，Michael and I could not let the people know that we were enemies．So，in the daytime it was safe to be in the town of Zenda．One day，soon after our night outside the castle，Princess Flavia and I were riding through the town when we saw a group of people dressed in black going to the church．Rupert of Hentzau was with them，and when he saw us，he turned his horse and came towards us．</p>
<p>当然，迈克尔和我不会让人们知道我们是对头，因此白天在曾达城里是安全的。有一天，城堡外的那一夜之后没多久，当我和弗蕾维亚公主骑着马在城里穿行时，看见一群人穿着黑衣服走进教堂。鲁帕特也和他们在一起。他看见我们，掉转马头冲我们走来。</p>
<p>'It's the funeral of my dear friend，Lauengram，'he said，in answer to our question．</p>
<p>“这是我的朋友劳恩格兰姆的葬礼。”他回答我们的问题说。</p>
<p>'I'm sorry your friend is dead，'I said to him．</p>
<p>“你的朋友死了我很难过。”我对他说。</p>
<p>'And I'm sorry，too，'Flavia added，her beautiful blue eyes sad．</p>
<p>“我也很难过。”弗蕾维亚说，她那美丽的蓝眼睛变得悲哀了。</p>
<p>Rupert looked at her and smiled．Then he turned and rode away．Although I was angry because he had smiled at Flavia，I went after him．</p>
<p>鲁帕特看着她，微笑了。然后他骑马离开了。虽然他对弗蕾维亚微笑使我生气，我还是追了上去。</p>
<p>'You fought bravely the other night，'I said，'and you're young．Help me save the King-and I'll help you．'</p>
<p>“那天晚上你很勇敢。”我说，“而且你正年轻，帮助我救出国王——我也会帮助你的。”</p>
<p>But Rupert was not interested．'No，'he answered．'But if they were both dead-the King and the Duke- then you could be King and marry your Princess，and I could be rich，and have the woman I want．'</p>
<p>但是鲁帕特不感兴趣。“不，”他回答。“不过如果他俩都死了——国王和公爵——你就能当上国王，娶你的公主，而我就可以有很多钱，而且得到我想要的女人。”</p>
<p>'Antoinette de Mauban？'I asked carelessly，trying not to show my interest．</p>
<p>“安&middot;德&middot;莫班？”我满不在乎地问，试图装着不感兴趣的样子。</p>
<p>'Yes，'replied Rupert．'I hate the Duke．She loves him，not me！'Angrily，he joined the funeral group again．</p>
<p>“对。”鲁帕特回答。“我恨公爵，她爱的是他，不是我！”他气冲冲地又回到葬礼的人群中去了。</p>
<p>Strangely，when we returned home there was a message for me from Antoinette herself．</p>
<p>奇怪的是，当我们回家时，一张安冬纳特本人写来的纸条正等着我们。</p>
<p>'I helped you once．Help me now．Save me from this terrible place！Save me from these murderers！'</p>
<p>“我曾经帮助过你，现在帮帮我。把我从这个可怕的地方救出去！从这些杀人凶手中间救出去！”</p>
<p>I was sorry for her，but what could I do？</p>
<p>我为她感到难过，但是我又能怎么样呢？</p><a href='11.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
