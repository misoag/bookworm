<p><b>7 为了对国王的爱 </b></p>
<p>Every day I was sent a secret report by the Chief of Police，and the next afternoon I was playing cards with Fritz when Sapt brought it in．We learned that Duke Michael and the Three had left Strelsau，and that Antoinette de Mauban had also left．Clearly，they had gone to Zenda．The report also said that the people were unhappy because the King had not yet asked Princess Flavia to marry him．</p>
<p>第二天下午我和弗里茨打牌时，萨普特带给我一封密信，那时每天警察长都要给我送一份秘密报告。我们得知迈克尔公爵和他的三个杀手离开了斯特莱索，安冬纳特&middot;德&middot;莫班也走了。很明显，他们去了曾达。报告还说臣民不太高兴，因为国王还没有请求弗蕾维亚公主嫁给他。</p>
<p>'Yes，'said Fritz．'It's true．I've heard that the Princess loves the King and she's very sad…'</p>
<p>“是这样，”弗里茨说，“这是真的，我听说公主爱国王，她很伤心……”</p>
<p>'Well，'Sapt informed us，'I've arranged a dance at the royal palace this evening，for the Princess．'</p>
<p>“喂，”萨普特通知我们，“我今晚在王宫为公主安排了一个舞会。”</p>
<p>'Why wasn't I told？'I asked angrily．</p>
<p>“为什么事先不告诉我？”我生气地说。</p>
<p>But Sapt continued，'Everything is arranged．And tonight you must ask the Princess to marry you．'</p>
<p>可是萨普特继续说着：“一切都安排好了。今天你就向公主求婚。”</p>
<p>'No！I'll do nothing to hurt her！'I cried．</p>
<p>“不！我决不做任何伤害她的事！”我叫道。</p>
<p>'All right，my boy，'Sapt smiled gently．'Just say something nice to her，then．Remember，she thinks you're the King and we don't want her to be angry with him，do we？'</p>
<p>“好的，我的孩子。”萨普特温和地微笑着。“那就只对她说些好听的话。记住，她以为你是国王。我们不想让她对国王生气，对吗？”</p>
<p>I understood，of course．If the King was saved，then Flavia must marry him．If he was not saved，then Sapt would ask me to stay and marry the Princess．Duke Michael must not be King．</p>
<p>我当然明白，如果国王得救了，弗蕾维亚就必须跟他结婚，如果他没得救，萨普特就会请我留下来，并且娶弗蕾维亚公主。决不能让迈克尔公爵当国王。</p>
<p>The dance was wonderful．Flavia was beautiful and I dancedwith her again and again．Everyone could feel our happiness．I forgot about the crowd of rich，colourful people who were watching us．I had eyes only for my beautiful Flavia．</p>
<p>舞会好极了。弗蕾维亚很美丽。我跟她一遍又一遍地跳舞，每个人都能感到我们的快乐。我忘了那些有钱的，打扮得多姿多彩的人们在看着我们。我的眼里只有我美丽的弗蕾维亚。</p>
<p>When supper had finished，Fritz touched me on the shoulder．I stood up，took Flavia's hand and led her into a little room．They brought coffee to us and then the door was closed quietly．The Princess and I were alone．</p>
<p>晚餐结束后，弗里茨碰了碰我的肩膀，我站了起来，拉着弗蕾维亚的手，把她带进一个小房间里，他们给我们送来了咖啡，然后门就轻轻关上了，公主和我单独呆在一起。</p>
<p>The windows of the little room opened onto the garden．The night was fine and the room was filled with the sweet smell of the flowers outside．Flavia sat down and I stood opposite her．I was fighting with myself…But then she looked at me-and I was lost！I forgot the King，I forgot who I was，I forgot everything！I fell to my knees，took her gently in my arms and kissed her．</p>
<p>小房间的窗户朝花园开着，夜色明朗，屋内充满了窗外鲜花的甜香。弗蕾维亚坐了下来，我站在她的对面。我跟自己在斗争着……可是她看着我，我失败了。我忘了国王，忘了我是谁，忘了一切。我跪了下来，轻轻地搂住她，吻了她。</p>
<p>Suddenly she pushed me away．'Is it true？Do you really love me？'she cried．'Or is it because you're the King and you must marry me？'</p>
<p>突然她推开了我：“这是真的吗？你真的爱我吗？”她说，“还是因为你是国王而不得不娶我？”</p>
<p>'No！'I answered quietly．'I love you more than my life！'</p>
<p>“不！”我静静地回答：“我爱你胜过爱我的生命！”</p>
<p>Flavia smiled．'Oh，why do I love you now？'she said softly．'I didn't love you before，but I do now．'</p>
<p>弗蕾维亚微笑了：“哦，为什么我现在爱你了？”她温柔地说，“以前我并不爱你，可现在我爱了。”</p>
<p>How happy I was！ It was not the King she loved．It was me -it was Rudolf Rassendyll！ But as I looked into her lovely face，I knew I could not live with the lie．How could I pretend to be the King any longer？</p>
<p>我多么幸福啊！她爱的并不是国王，而是我——鲁道夫&middot;拉森狄尔！可是当我望着她可爱的脸，我知道我没法再对她撒谎。我怎么能继续装扮我是国王呢？</p>
<p>'There's something I must tell you…'I began in a low voice．</p>
<p>“有件事我必须告诉你……”我低声说。</p>
<p>'Your Majesty，'said a voice from the garden．'People are waiting to say goodbye．'</p>
<p>“国王陛下，”花园里有人说道：“人们都在等着跟您告别呢。”</p>
<p>It was Sapt．He had heard me talking to the Princess．</p>
<p>是萨普特，他听见我和公主说的话了。</p>
<p>'We'll come，'I replied coldly．</p>
<p>“我们就来。”我冷冷地回答。</p>
<p>But Flavia，her eyes full of her love for me， held out her hand to Sapt as he came into the room．He took it and said softly and sadly，'God save your Royal Highness．'And then he added，'But before all comes the King-God save the King！'</p>
<p>可是弗蕾维亚的眼里充满了对我的爱，对走进房间的萨普特伸出手去。他握着她的手，温柔而又伤感地说：“上帝拯救公主殿下。”然后他又加了一句：“可是国王高于一切，上帝拯救国王！”</p>
<p>When Sapt told the people that Princess Flavia had accepted the King as her future husband，they were wild with happiness．</p>
<p>当萨普特宣告说弗蕾维亚公主接受国王作为她未来的丈夫时，人们都乐得发疯了。</p>
<p>'You know，Sapt，'I said sadly，'I could marry the Princess and let my people kill Duke Michael-and the King．'</p>
<p>“你知道，萨普特，”我悲哀地说，“我可以娶了公主，并且让我的人民杀了迈克尔公爵，还有国王。”</p>
<p>'I know，'Sapt replied quietly．</p>
<p>“我知道。”萨普特静静地回答。</p>
<p>'So we must go to Zenda and bring the King home atonce！'I said．</p>
<p>“所以我们必须立即去曾达，把国王弄回来！”</p>
<p>Sapt put his hand on my shoulder．'You're the finest Elph-berg of them all，'he said with feeling．</p>
<p>萨普特把手放在我的肩上：“在所有艾尔弗伯格家族的人当中，你是最好的一个。”他动情地说。</p>
<p>Before we left Strelsau，I saw the Marshal and asked him to stay near Flavia，to take care of her and to keep her safe from Duke Michael．Then I went to say goodbye to her．At first she was cold with me．She did not understand why I wanted to leave her．But her anger changed to fear when I told her that I was going after Duke Michael．</p>
<p>在我们离开斯特莱索之前，我见了元帅，并且请他呆在弗蕾维亚身边，照顾她并且使她免受迈克尔公爵的打扰。然后我去向她告别。起初她对我很冷淡，她不明白为什么我想离开她。但当我告诉她我去追赶迈克尔公爵时，她的怒气变成了恐惧。</p>
<p>'Oh，Rudolf，be careful！'she cried．'He's a dangerous man！Please come back safely to me．'</p>
<p>“哦，鲁道夫，小心点儿！”她说，“他是个危险的家伙！请你一定要平安地回到我的身边。”</p>
<p>'Duke Michael can never keep me away from you，'I promised．But in my heart I knew that another man could．</p>
<p>“迈克尔公爵永远也别想让我离开你。”我保证道。但在我心里，我知道另一个人却能做到。</p><a href='8.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
