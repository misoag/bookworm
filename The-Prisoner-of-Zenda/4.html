<p><b>4 我的历险开始了 </b></p>
<p>As we made our way to the palace，I began to feel that I really was the King of Ruritania，with Marshal Strakencz，the head of the army，on my right and old Sapt on my left．I could see that Strelsau was really two towns the Old Town and the New Town．The people of the Old Town，who were poor，wanted Duke Michael to be their King，but the people of the New Town wanted King Rudolf．We went through the New Town first，and it was bright and colourful，with the ladies'dresses and the red roses of the Elphbergs．The people shouted loudly for their King as we passed through the streets．But when we came to the Old Town，the Marshal and Sapt moved nearer to my horse，and I could see that they were afraid for me．</p>
<p>在去王宫的路上，军队的首领斯特肯茨元帅站在我的右边，老萨普特站在我的左边，我开始感到自己真的是卢里塔尼亚的国王了。我看到斯特莱索实际上是两个城——老城和新城。老城的人是穷人，他们想要迈克尔公爵当国王。新城的人却希望鲁道夫当国王。我们先经过新城，城里女人们的衣饰和艾尔弗伯格红玫瑰使得城市明亮艳丽。我们经过大街时，人们高声为国王欢呼。但当我们来到老城时，元帅和老萨普特靠近我的马，我能看出他们为我担心。</p>
<p>'Stay back！'I called．'I'll show my people that I'm not afraid of them．'Some of the crowd were pleased when they heard this，but most of them watched me in silence．</p>
<p>“退回去！”我叫道：“我要让我的人民看看我并不害怕他们。”人群中有些人听到了我的话感到很高兴，但大多数人沉默地看着我。</p>
<p>Finally，we reached the great church of Strelsau．I remember very little of the coronation-only two faces．One was a beauti ful girl with wonderful red hair，the Princess Flavia．The other was the face of a man with black hair and dark，deep eyes-Black Michael．When he saw me，his face turned white．Clearly，he was surprised and deeply unhappy to see me．</p>
<p>终于我们来到了斯特莱索大教堂，大典的事儿我差不多都记不得了，除了两张面孔以外。一张是一个漂亮姑娘的，她长了一头绝妙的红头发。她是弗蕾维亚公主。另一张脸是一个男人的，他长着黑头发，深黑色的眼睛。他就是黑迈克尔。当他看见我时，他的面色发白了。很清楚，他见到我很吃惊，而且非常不快。</p>
<p>The coronation seemed to last for hours，but I managed to say and do all the right things．At last it was over，and I was now the King of Ruritania！As Princess Flavia and I drove back to the palace in an open car，one man in the crowd called out，'When's the wedding？'</p>
<p>加冕典礼持续了几个小时，但我总算说对了也做对了所有的事儿。最后仪式终于结束了，现在我是卢里塔尼亚国王了！当弗蕾维亚公主和我乘着敞篷车回宫殿时，人群中有人对我们喊道：“什么时候举行婚礼？”</p>
<p>The Princess's face went a little pink when she heard this．After a while she said，'You seem different today，Rudolf．Quieter and more serious．Are you going to become a more sensible person now？'</p>
<p>公主听到这话时她的脸有点儿发红。过了一会儿她说：“鲁道夫，你看起来不大一样，你变得安静严肃了。你现在会变得更明智些了吧？”</p>
<p>The Princess，I realized，did not think very highly of the King．As for me，I thought the King was a very lucky man．</p>
<p>我明白了，公主对国王的评价不太高。在我看来，国王是一个非常幸运的人。</p>
<p>'If that will please you，I'll try to do it，'I said softly．</p>
<p>“如果那样能使你高兴的话，我就试试这么做。”我柔和地说。</p>
<p>The Princess's face went pink again．Then she said，'You must be careful of Michael．You know．'</p>
<p>公主的脸红了，然后她说：“你得小心迈克尔，你知道……”</p>
<p>'I know，'I said，'that he wants what I have，and also what I hope to have one day．'As I spoke，I looked at her，and she smiled at me prettily．</p>
<p>“我知道，”我说，“他想得到我所拥有的，还想得到我有朝一日想得到的。”我这么说的时候眼睛看着她，她对我微笑着，很可爱。</p>
<p>'I wonder what the King's doing now，'I thought．</p>
<p>“我真想知道国王现在在干嘛？”我暗想。</p>
<p>The royal dinner went on for a long time，but at last Fritz，Sapt，and I were alone in the King's dressing-room．</p>
<p>宫廷晚宴持续了很长时间，不过弗里茨、萨普特和我总算单独呆在国王的更衣室里了。</p>
<p>'You did well，'Fritz said，'but，Rassendyll，be careful！Black Michael looked blacker than ever today-because you and the Princess had so much to say to each other．'</p>
<p>“你干得不错，”弗里茨说，“但是拉森狄尔，小心一点！黑迈克尔今天看起来特别黑，因为你和公主两人有那么多可说的。”</p>
<p>'She's very beautiful，'I replied．</p>
<p>“她美极了。”我回答。</p>
<p>'Come on，'Sapt cried．'There's no time for that now．We must leave for Zenda at once，to find the King！If we're caught，we'll all be killed！Black Michael has had a letter from Zenda，so perhaps he knows already．Don't unlock the door，Fritz，while we're away，or you'll be a dead man．Say the King must be left alone to rest．Now，come on．The horses are ready．'</p>
<p>“得了，”萨普特说，“现在没工夫说这些了，我们得立即去曾达，去找国王！假如我们被逮住了，我们都得死！黑迈克尔收到了一封曾达来的信，所以他也许已经知道了。我们不在的时候你别开门，弗里茨，不然你会死的。你就说国王得一个人呆着休息。现在，走吧，马已经准备好了。”</p>
<p>Fritz and I shook hands，then I covered my red hair and most of my face．Sapt and I left the room by a secret door，and we found ourselves outside，at the back of the palace gardens．A man was waiting there with two horses．</p>
<p>弗里茨和我握握手，然后我挡上我的头发和大半个脸。萨普特和我从一个秘密的门出了房间，就到了宫殿的花园后面，一个人正牵着两匹马等着我们。</p>
<p>Soon we left the town behind us，and we were out in the country．We rode like the wind and by ten o'clock had come to the edge of the forest of Zenda．</p>
<p>很快我们将城市抛在了身后，进入了乡间。我们骑着马像风一样快，10点钟时我们已经来到了曾达的森林边。</p>
<p>Suddenly Sapt stopped．'Listen！'he said quietly．'Horses behind us！Quick！Get down！The castle's to the left，'he continued．'Our road's to the right．'</p>
<p>突然萨普特停住了。“听！”他悄悄地说，“我们后面有马蹄声！快！下马！去城堡走左边的路，我们的路是右边这条。”</p>
<p>We hid in the thick trees，and we waited and watched．The men came nearer．It was Black Michael and another man．When they came to the two roads，they stopped．</p>
<p>我们躲在密密的树林里，等待着，注视着。那些人走近了，是黑迈克尔和另一个男人。当他们走到两条路口时，他们停住了。</p>
<p>'Which way？'the Duke asked．</p>
<p>“怎么走？”公爵问。</p>
<p>'To the castle！'the other man cried'They'll know there what's been happening．'</p>
<p>“去城堡！”另一个说，“他们会知道那儿出了什么事。”</p>
<p>The Duke waited for a moment．'To Zenda then！'he cried finally，and the two men took the road to the left．</p>
<p>公爵等了一会儿。“那就去曾达！”他终于说道。然后两人就朝左边的路走了。</p>
<p>We waited for ten more minutes，and then we hurried on．</p>
<p>我们又等了十多分钟，然后赶紧上路。</p>
<p>When we arrived at the house in the forest，we ran to the underground rooms．The one where Sapt had locked up the old woman was empty．She had escaped！The other room was locked．Sapt's face was white with fear．Between us，we broke down the door and ran in．I found a light and looked round the room．The servant Josef was on the floor-dead！I held up the light and looked in every corner of the room．</p>
<p>我们到达林中小屋，冲进地下室。萨普特老太太的那间房间空了。她逃走了！另一间房子锁着。萨普特的脸因为紧张而发白。我俩砸开门冲了进去，我找到一盏灯，朝四周看去，老仆人约瑟夫躺在地板上死了。我举着灯，把房间的每一个角落都看遍了。</p>
<p>'The King isn't herer！'I said．</p>
<p>“国王不在这儿。”我说。</p><a href='5.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
