<p><b>10 玛丽亚 </b></p>
<p>And so now I have written it．It is three o'clock in the morning．The house is very quiet and the wind has stopped．I can hear the sound of the wood burning in the fire and the clock on the stairs．Somewhere upstairs Arthur Nicholls is sleeping quietly．</p>
<p>现在我写完了。凌晨3点钟，整幢房子非常寂静，风也停了。我可以听见木柴在火中燃烧的声音，还有楼梯上钟的嘀哒声。楼上，亚瑟&middot;尼可斯静静地睡着。</p>
<p>I know that Charlotte's friend， Mrs Gaskell， has nearly fin－ished her book about Charlotte．Perhaps I will show her what I have written．</p>
<p>我知道夏洛蒂的朋友盖斯凯尔夫人快写完夏洛蒂的传记了，或许我会给她看看我写下的这些。</p>
<p>Perhaps．But I don't think so．I wrote to her before，and an-swered her questions，and that is enough．She is a writer， she can write her own book．I will keep this book in my desk，for myself—and perhaps for Arthur Nicholls．There is no need for other people to read it． My daughter Charlotte is famous al－ready，and when Mrs Gaskell has written about her，she will be more famous still．</p>
<p>也许，但也许不会。我以前给她写过信，回答了一些她的问题，那已经够了。她是个作家，会写好自己的书的。我会把这本书放在我的书桌里，只给我自己——或许还有亚瑟&middot;尼可斯看。没有必要给别人看了。我女儿夏洛蒂已经成名了，而且盖斯凯尔夫人的书写好了，她会更出名的。</p>
<p>I wish my wife Maria could read Charlotte's books—and Emily's，and Anne's．Perhaps she can． We had some fine children， didn't we， Maria？</p>
<p>我真想我妻子玛丽亚能读读夏洛蒂的书——还有爱米丽和安妮的。或许她能看到，我们有一些多么出色的孩子，玛丽亚，是吗？</p>
<p>I wonder if she can hear me．It is a fine night，now that the wind has stoppod．There is a bright moon，and the sky is full of stars．I think I will go outside，and walk through the graveyard to the church，and talk to Maria there．</p>
<p>我不知道她是否能听见我的话。今夜天气很好，风现在也已停了。一轮明月当空，天上繁星点缀。我想我会出去走走，穿过墓地，到教堂去，在那儿和玛丽亚谈谈。</p></body></html>
