<p><b>6 秃头作家 </b></p>
<p>Ⅰ spent the night in the hills，in some thick heather be-hind a rock. I had no coat and I was very cold. My coat，Scudder's notebook，my watch and even my pipe and tobacco were with Mr Turnbull. All I had was some biscuits.</p>
<p>那天我就在山里岩石后的茂密石楠丛里过夜。我身上没大衣，觉得很冷。我的大衣、斯卡德尔的笔记本、我的手表、甚至我的烟斗和烟都留在特恩布尔先生那儿了。尽我所有只是一点饼干。</p>
<p>I had half the biscuits for supper. and tried to keep warm in the heather. I was feeling quite pleased. So far I had been very lucky. The milkman，the man at the hotel，Sir Harry，the roadman and even Marmaduke had all helped me，and I felt that with help like this I might win. My main problem now was that I was very hungry. I fell asleep imagining the most beautiful meals.</p>
<p>我吃了一半饼干当晚餐，偎在石楠丛里尽量保持热量。而我心里觉得乐滋滋的。迄今为止，我运气还不错。送奶员、旅店老板、哈里爵士、修路人甚至马默杜克都帮了我的忙，有这样的帮助我觉得会成功。现在主要问题是我太饿了。我梦想着一顿顿美餐昏昏入睡。</p>
<p>I woke up very cold in the early morning. I looked down the hill，and in a second I was putting my boots on as fast as I could. There were men only a few hundred metres below me，walking up and searching the heather step by step.</p>
<p>大清早我一睁眼就觉得冷得不得了。向山下看了看，我分秒必争地穿上鞋。离我只有数百米的下面有一伙人向上爬着，仔细地搜索着石楠丛。</p>
<p>Keeping low in the heather，I moved up the hill. At the top，I stood up and showed myself. I heard men shouting，and then I pretended to disappear over the top of the hill， but in fact I got down in the heather and crawled back down into the valley. After twenty minutes I looked back and saw the men disappearing over the top of the hill.</p>
<p>我在石楠丛里紧贴着地面向山上爬。到了山顶，我站起来不再躲藏。我听到人们的呐喊声，于是便假装向山的那坡逃去，而实际隐身于石楠丛中，向下又爬回峡谷。二十分钟后我回头看看，那些人正在越过山顶向那一坡追去。</p>
<p>I didn't know where I was，but I knew I must keep moving. I was twenty minutes in front of them， but they were local men and they knew these hills better than I did. Soon they were close behind me and I was running as fast as I could. After a time I saw to my left some trees and the chim－neys of a farmhouse. I ran down towards them and found my－self in a garden. As I came nearer the house，I saw an old man looking at me through an open door. I crossed the garden and went in.</p>
<p>我不知道我在什么地方，只知道我必须不停地走。我领先他们二十分钟，但他们是当地人，对这片山地比我熟悉。不久他们就紧紧跟上来了，我就竭力地跑着。过了一会儿，我看到左首有一片树林和一家农舍的烟囱。于是就奔那里跑去，不觉得到了一个庭院里。我向房子走去，这时一个老头开着门正在瞧着我。我穿过庭院，进了屋。</p>
<p>I was in a pleasant room，with books everywhere. At a desk in the middle sat an old man with a kind face. He had glasses on the end of his nose，and the top of his bald head shone like glass. He didn't move，but looked up and waited for me to speak.</p>
<p>我进了一间很不错的屋子，屋子里摆满了书。中间放着一张书桌，桌旁坐着一位老人，神态慈祥。鼻尖上架着一副眼镜，头顶秃秃的像玻璃一样闪着光。他一动不动，抬着头等着我开口。</p>
<p>I was so surprised by his calmness that for a minute I just stared at him.</p>
<p>他的镇定出乎我意料，以至于有一会儿我只是呆呆地望着他。</p>
<p>'You're in a hurry，my friend，'he said slowly.</p>
<p>“朋友，您很着急呀，”他缓缓地说。</p>
<p>I looked out of the window at the moor. We could both see the line of men walking through the heather.</p>
<p>我透过窗户向荒原望去，我们俩都看到一队人正穿行于石楠丛中。</p>
<p>'Ah，I see，'he said. 'The police are after you， are they？Well，we'll talk about it later. I don't like the police in my house when I'm working. Go through that door on the left and close it behind you. You will be safe in there. '</p>
<p>“我明白了，”他说。“警察在追您，是不是？这事我们过一会儿再说。我干活的时候不喜欢警察到我家来打搅。请走左边的门，随手把门关上。那里很安全。”</p>
<p>And this extraordinary man picked up his pen and started to write.</p>
<p>这位不同寻常的老人拿起笔写起字来。</p>
<p>I did what he said， and found myself in a small room with only a very small window high up in one wall. The door closed behind me. Once again I had found somewhere to hide.</p>
<p>我听他的，不觉来到一间小屋，只有一个小窗户还开得很高。门已经关好。我又找到藏身之处了。</p>
<p>But I didn't feel comfortable. There was something strange about the old man. I had suddenly appeared in his house， but he didn't seem surprised. And his eyes were frighteningly in－telligent. I waited，and tried to forget that I was very hungry. I thought about breakfast，and suddenly the door opened and there was the old man again.</p>
<p>然而我觉得不自在。这个老头哪里有点怪。我突然闯进屋，可是看来他一点也不吃惊。他那双眼睛睿智得叫人害怕。我在那儿等着，极力不去想辘辘饥肠。我正在想着早饭，门突然打开了，又是那个老头。</p>
<p>'I told the police you had gone over the hill. This is a lucky morning for you，Mr Richard Hannay，'he said， smiling.</p>
<p>“我告诉警察您已经翻山走了。理查德&middot;哈内先生，今天上午您真运气。”他笑着说。</p>
<p>As he spoke，his eyes half closed， and immediately I re-membered Scudder's description of a man who could'hood his eyes like a hawk. I saw that I had walked into the hands of my enemies.</p>
<p>他说话的时候，眼睛眯着，我猛地记起斯卡德尔说过一个人，这个人能“像猫头鹰那样眯着眼睛”。我意识到我已经走到敌人的手心里来了。</p>
<p>My first thought was to knock him down and run， but two men came through the door. They were carrying guns.</p>
<p>我第一个想法是把他打倒然后逃跑，可是两条汉子推门而入。他们手里都拿着枪。</p>
<p>The old man knew my name， but he had never seen me be-fore. I took a chance. 'I don't know what you mean，'I said roughly. 'And who are you calling Hannay？ My name's Ainslie. '</p>
<p>老头知道我叫什么，但从来没见过我。我想碰碰运气。“我不明白您说什么，”我粗声粗气地说。“您叫谁哈内？我的名字叫安斯利。”</p>
<p>'Of course，you have many names，'he said，still smiling. 'We won't argue about a name. '</p>
<p>“当然，您有好多名字，”他仍然笑着说。“别为名字抬杠了。”</p>
<p>I looked at him angrily. 'I suppose you're going to call the police back. I wish I'd never seen that car. Here's the money. 'I put four pounds on the table.</p>
<p>我忿忿然地看着他。“我猜您要把警察叫回来。当初要是没见到那辆车就什么事也没有了。”我把四英磅放在桌子上。</p>
<p>'I won't call the police，'he said. 'This is a private problem between yon and me. '</p>
<p>“我不会叫警察，”他说。“这是你我之间的私事。”</p>
<p>'Oh，stop it！'I cried. 'I've had no luck since I left my ship in Edinburgh. I found a crashed car and took a little money out of it， and I've had the police after me for two days. You do what you like. Ned Ainslie's finished. '</p>
<p>“得了，住口吧！”我喊起来。“从爱丁堡一下船我就不顺。碰到一辆撞坏的汽车，从里边拿了点钱，结果警察追了我两天。您爱怎么样随便好了。奈德&middot;安斯利算完了。”</p>
<p>I could hear doubt in his voice when he next spoke.</p>
<p>他又开始说话，从声音里我可以听出他的犹豫不决。</p>
<p>'Would you be kind enough to tell me what you've been do－ing for the last few days？'</p>
<p>“劳您驾能不能告诉我最近几天您都干什么了？”</p>
<p>I can't. I haven't eaten for two days. Give me something to eat and I'll tell you the truth. 'I put on my best begging voice.</p>
<p>“不行。我两天没吃饭了。给我点东西吃，然后我实话实说。”我尽量装出恳求的声调。</p>
<p>Some food was brought to me， and while I was eating， he said something to me in German. I stared at him stupidly. Then I told him my story. I was a sailor，and I had left my ship in Edinburgh to travel across Scotland to see my brother. I had found a car in a river and taken some money from it. But the police were now chasing me.</p>
<p>饭给我端来了，我一边吃他一边用德语对我讲什么。我就傻呼呼地盯着他。然后把我的故事讲给他听。我是个海员，从爱丁堡下的船，路过苏格兰去看我兄弟。在那里我看到一辆汽车，于是在里边拿了点钱。可警察就一直紧追不舍。</p>
<p>'They can have their money back，'I cried. ' It's only brought me trouble！'</p>
<p>“他们可以把钱拿回去嘛，”我叫道。“这点钱净给我添乱！”</p>
<p>'You're good at lying，Hannay，'he said.</p>
<p>“哈内，您挺会撒谎的，”他说。</p>
<p>I started to get very angry. 'My name's Ainslie and I don't know anybody called Hannay. I'd rather have the police than you and your guns and your Hannays. No，I'm sorry，sir，I'm grateful for the food，but I'd like to go now. '</p>
<p>我发起怒来。“我叫安斯利，不认识什么叫哈内的人。我宁可让警察抓住也比叫您、您的枪和您的哈内抓住好。对不起，先生，我不干，感谢您的饭，现在我想走了。”</p>
<p>I could see that he was not sure. He had never seen me，and I suppose I did not look like my photograph.</p>
<p>可以看出他犹豫不决了。他从来没见过我，而且，我猜我看起来也不像我的照片。</p>
<p>'I won't let you go. If you are Mr Ainslie，then you'll soon be able to prove it. If you're not，then I have a surprise for you. '</p>
<p>“我不让您走。假如您是安斯利先生的话，很快您就能证明一点。假如您不是，那么我会让您大吃一惊。”</p>
<p>He rang a bell，and a third servant appeared.</p>
<p>他按门铃，第三个仆人来了。</p>
<p>'I want the car in five minutes，'he said. 'There will be three for lunch. '</p>
<p>“五分钟后我要用车，”他说。“预备三个人的午餐。”</p>
<p>Then he looked at me， and that was the most frightening thing of all. His eyes were unnatural-bright，cold and evil. I tried to stare back，and even to smile.</p>
<p>然后他就看着我，那目光比什么都可怕。他的眼睛不同寻常——明亮、阴冷、邪恶。我极力以眼还眼，甚至极力装出笑脸。</p>
<p>'You'll know me next time we meet，' I said.</p>
<p>“下回再见面您就认识我了，”我说道。</p>
<p>'Karl，'he said，speaking in German. 'Put this man in the back room until I return. '</p>
<p>“卡尔，”他用德语说。“把这个人放到后面的屋里等我回来再说。”</p>
<p>I was taken out of the room with a gun at each ear.</p>
<p>我被拉出屋去，一边耳朵顶着一枝枪。</p>
<p>The back room was very dark and full of old bottles and boxes. The windows had shutters on the outside. The key turned in the door，and I could hear the feet of the guards outside.</p>
<p>后面的屋黑洞洞的堆满旧瓶子和破箱子。窗户外面安着百叶窗。钥匙插在锁孔里，我可以听到外面卫兵的脚步声。</p>
<p>I sat down feeling very unhappy. The old man had gone to collect his friends，the men who had talked to me when I was the roadman. They would soon discover that I was not the roadman，nor Mr Ainslie，but Richard Hannay. I began to wish I had been found by the police；I would feel safer with them than with this man and his two friends.</p>
<p>我坐下来，感到心情很不好。那个老头去叫他的朋友，那些人在我装修路人的时候和我说过话。他们很快就会知道我既不是修路人，也不是安斯利先生而是理查德&middot;哈内。我想还不如让警察抓住的好；让警察抓住比让这个人和他那两个朋友抓住我觉得安全些。</p>
<p>They were coming for lunch，so I had only two hours. I tried the windows but they would not move. I felt the boxes and bottles，and then found a door in the wall. It was a cup－board door， and it was locked. I had nothing else to do so I pulled on it until it opened.</p>
<p>他们要回来吃午饭，所以我只有两个小时的时间。我试着打开窗户，可是弄不动。我摸索着箱子、瓶子，后来发现墙上有个门，是壁橱的门，紧锁着。除此无法可想，所以我就使劲拉那个门，门被打开了。</p>
<p>There were a lot of things inside. On one shelf there were some matches， and I used them to look more closely. At the back of one shelf was a strong wooden box. I broke it open and found， to my surprise，some fuses and several small square packets of explosive.</p>
<p>屋里放着好多东西。在一个书架上有火柴，我点着火柴，更仔细地观察着。在一个书架后面放着个硬木箱。我把箱子打开，出乎我的意料，里面有导火索和若干方形包装的炸药。</p>
<p>I knew that with these I could blow the house up. The problem was that I didn't know how much to use. If I used too much， I would blow myself up. But if I didn't use them at all，I would be dead in three hours.</p>
<p>我知道用这些炸药可以把整座房子炸飞。问题是我不知道该用多少炸药。如果用得太多，那么会连我自己也被炸飞。而要是索性不用，那么用不了三个小时我就得完蛋。</p>
<p>I put one of the squares of explosive near the door， and put a fuse from there to the other side of the room. I lit the fuse and hid behind some boxes. There was silence for five seconds…</p>
<p>我把一包炸药放在门边，把导火索从那儿接到屋的另一头。我点着导火索，躲在箱子后面。五秒钟内默无声息……</p>
<p>The wall exploded into a bright yellow light， something fell on my left arm， and I became unconscious.</p>
<p>轰然一声，屋墙被炸成亮黄色的火光，什么东西砸到我的左臂上，后来就失去了知觉。</p>
<p>I was unconscious for only a few seconds. Then I stood up，trying not to breathe the yellow smoke. The window had been blown out and I climbed out into the garden. Across the gar－den there were some buildings，and one was an old tower. I felt too ill to go very far，and that seemed the best hiding place.</p>
<p>我只昏迷了几秒钟。然后我站起来，尽量不呼吸炸药的黄烟。窗户被炸开了，我爬窗而出，跳到庭院里。庭院的对面是房子，其中有一个古塔。我感觉太难受，没法走远，看来这个塔是个最好的藏身之所。</p>
<p>The climb up the outside of that tower was the most difficult thing I ever did. My head felt terrible， and the smoke had made me very sick， but in the end I managed it， and lay down at the top. Then I became unconscious again.</p>
<p>从塔的外面向上爬，我从来没干过这么难的事。我头疼得要命，硝烟熏得我很难受，但最后终于爬了上去，在塔顶上躺下来。后来我又昏过去了。</p>
<p>When I woke up，my head was burning and the sun was shining into my face. I lay for a long time without moving. I could hear men talking. I looked through a hole in the wall and saw men with guns. There was the bald man and I thought I could see the fat one too.</p>
<p>醒来时我觉得头发烧，阳光照在我的脸上。我一动不动地躺了好长时间。我可以听到人们的说话声。透过墙上的窟隆我看到人们都拿着枪。有那个秃头的人，我想还会有那个胖子。</p>
<p>For half an hour they searched all the buildings. They came to the door at the bottom of my tower， and for a minute I thought they were going to come up，but the door was locked.</p>
<p>他们把所有建筑物搜索了半个小时。他们又来到塔底的门口，我一闪念，以为他们准备要上来，然而门给锁上了。</p>
<p>All afternoon I lay on that roof. I was terribly thirsty， and，to make it worse，I could see and hear a small stream which came off the moor and flowed near the farm. I wanted a drink of that cool clear water more than anything in the world.</p>
<p>我在塔顶躺了整整一个下午。我口渴得要命，更糟糕的是我可以看到也可以听到从荒原上流来一条小溪，在附近的田野里淌着。要是能喝上一口这么清凉的水，这世界上什么东西我都不想要了。</p>
<p>From the tower I could see all the moor around. I saw two men go off in a car， and another man on a horse，and I imag-ined they were looking for me. But I could also see something more interesting. At the top of the hill behind the house was a ring of trees with grass inside. It was clear that this was where the plane landed.</p>
<p>从塔顶可以看到四周的荒原。我看见两个人坐车走了，另一个则骑着马，我估计他们正在找我。我还看见了更有意思的东西。在房子后面的山顶上，树围成一个圆圈，圈里是草地。很显然，这是飞机降落的地方。</p>
<p>It was an excellent place for an airfield. It could not be seen from below because it was at the top of the hill； from the valley，the hill seemed covered with trees. And anyone watching the plane coming in to land would think it was just flying over the hill. I realized that if the plane arrived now， the pilot would probably see me，so I lay still， and hoped night would come quickly.</p>
<p>这个地方作机场太好了。它位于山顶，所以从下往上看不到；从山谷向上看，看到山好像被树覆盖着。所以，如果有人看到飞来要降落的飞机还以为飞机正在飞越山顶。我意识到如果现在飞机飞过来，驾驶员多半会看见我，所以我躺着一动不动，盼着天快点黑下来。</p>
<p>Luckily，when the plane did arrive，it was almost dark. I watched it land，and then waited until everything was quiet. There was no moon， and I was too thirsty to wait，so at nine o'clock I climbed down. Halfway down， somebody came out of the house with a light，and I froze. Then the light disap－peared and I continued down to the ground.</p>
<p>运气真是不错，飞机真地飞过来的时候，天差不多黑了。我望着飞机降落，然后等着一切归于平静。天上没有月亮，我渴得等不下去了，于是九点钟我爬了下去。走了一半，我看见有人拿着灯从房里出来，我吓得僵住了。后来灯光不见了，我接着走到平地上。</p>
<p>I crawled as far as the trees. I guessed that the house would be guarded in some way，so I continued very slowly and care-fully，and found a wire about sixty centimetres from the ground. Falling over that would doubtless start alarm bells ringing in the house.</p>
<p>我沿着树林一直爬。我估计着那所房子会怎么布置警戒，所以，我慢慢地、小心翼翼地爬，看到有一截电线露出地面大约六十厘米。如果绊上肯定会引响房里的警铃。</p>
<p>A hundred metres further on there was another wire， but after that it was the open moor. Ten minutes later I had my head in the stream and I drank litres of cold water.</p>
<p>一百米开外还有一段电线，后面便是开阔的荒原。爬了十分钟，我一头扎进小溪，喝了好几升凉水。</p>
<p>I did not stop again until I was ten kilometres from that terrible house.</p>
<p>我跑出距那所可怕的房子有十公里才停下脚。</p><a href='7.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
