<p><b>9 三十九级台阶 </b></p>
<p>Sir Walter got up and left the room. He came back after ten minutes. 'I've spoken to Alloa. I got him out of bed-he was very angry. He hasn't left his house all day. '</p>
<p>瓦尔特爵士站起身走出房间。十分钟后又回来了。“我和阿罗通过话了。我把他叫下床——他火了。一整天他没离开过房间。”</p>
<p>'It's impossible，' said Winstanley. ' I sat next to him for nearly half an hour. '</p>
<p>“那不可能，”温斯坦利说。“我在他旁边坐了差不多半个小时。”</p>
<p>'That's what's so clever，' I said. 'You were too interested in other things to look at him closely. You knew that he might be well enough to come tonight and，as First Sea Lord，it was natural for him to be here. Why should you suspect that it wasn't him？'</p>
<p>“这就是所谓聪明，”我说。“你们的兴趣太专注在其它事情上了，而没有仔细看他。你们知道他的身体也许允许他今晚来开会，而且作为第一海军大臣来这里也是合情合理的。你们有什么理由怀疑不是他呢？”</p>
<p>Then the Frenchman spoke，very slowly，and in good English.</p>
<p>后来那个法国人开口了，他说得很慢但英语讲得很好。</p>
<p>'This young man is right. He understands our enemies. People only see what they expect to see. This man came late，spoke little，and left early but he behaved exactly as we would expect Lord Alloa to behave. '</p>
<p>“这个年轻人说得对。他了解敌人。人们只能看到他们期待看到的东西。这个人来得晚、说得少、走得早——他的言行举止和我们想像的阿罗勋爵一模一样。”</p>
<p>'But I don't understand，'said Winstanley. 'Our enemies don't want us to know what they have learnt about our war plans. But if one us talked to Alloa abut tonight's meeting，we would discover immediately that he hadn't been here. '</p>
<p>“可我不明白，”温斯坦利说。“敌人不想让我们知道他们已经获悉我们的作战计划。但要是我们有谁向阿罗谈起今晚会议的事，我们立刻就会发现他没来这里。”</p>
<p>Sir Walter laughed angrily. 'That shows their cleverness again， in choosing Alloa. They took a risk， but everybody knows that Alloa is a sick man and is often too ill to go to meetings. And even when he is well，he is impatient，difficult，and a man of very few words. Which of us was likely to speak to him about tonight？'</p>
<p>瓦尔特爵士冷笑着。“这再次说明他们选中阿罗是他们的聪明之处。他们确实在铤而走险，可人们都知道阿罗有病，而且常常病得不能出席会议。即便他好的时候，他也没有耐心、难打交道、很少说话。我们谁会向他提今天晚上的事呢？”</p>
<p>'But the spy hasn't taken the plans，'said Winstanley. ' He saw them， but could he carry away pages of information in his head？'</p>
<p>“可是间谍还没有拿到计划呀，”温斯坦利说。“他见到了计划，可是他能把一页页的情报放在脑袋里装走吗？”</p>
<p>'It's not difficult，'said the Frenchman. 'A good spy can remember things photographically. '</p>
<p>“那并不难，”法国人说。“好间谍记东西和照相一样。”</p>
<p>'Well，I suppose we'll have to change our plans，'said Sir Walter unhappily.</p>
<p>“我想我们必须改变计划，”瓦尔特爵士悻悻地说。</p>
<p>'There's another problem，'said Royer. 'I said a lot about the plans of the French army. That information will be very valuable to our enemies. That man， and his friends，must be stopped immediately. '</p>
<p>“还有一个问题，”罗耶说。“关于法军的计划我谈了很多。这些情报对敌人非常有用。得马上制止这个人和他同伙的行动。”</p>
<p>'They could simply send their information in a letter，'said Whittaker. 'It may already be in the post. '</p>
<p>“他们仅仅写封信就可以把情报送出去，”惠特克说。“说不定现在已经在邮局了。”</p>
<p>'No，' said Rower. 'A spy brings home his information personally and he collects his pay personally. These men must cross the sea， so we still have a chance. You must watch the coast and search ships. It is desperately important for both France and Britain. '</p>
<p>“不会的，”罗耶说。“间谍都是亲自带着情报，也亲自领取报酬。这伙人一定会从海上走，我们还有一次机会。你们要监视海岸，搜查船只。这件事对法国和英国都至关重要。”</p>
<p>Royer was right. We could do something. But none of us felt very hopeful. How， among the forty million people in Britain， could we find the three cleverest criminals in Europe？</p>
<p>罗耶说得很对。我们还有所作为。但都觉得希望不大。英国有四千万人口，怎么才能找到那三个欧洲最机智过人的罪犯呢？”</p>
<p>Then，suddenly， I had an idea.</p>
<p>后来，我突然想出个主意来。</p>
<p>'Where is Scudder's book？'I asked Sir Walter. 'Quick， I remember something in it. '</p>
<p>“斯卡德尔的小本在哪儿？”我问瓦尔特爵士。“快点，我记得里边有点什么。”</p>
<p>He gave it to me.</p>
<p>他把小本递给我。</p>
<p>I found the place. 'Thirty－nine steps，'I read， and again， 'Thirty－nine steps-I counted them－high tide，10. 17p. m. '</p>
<p>我找到那一页。“三十九级台阶，”我念着，接着又念下去，“三十九级台阶——我数过——涨潮，下午十点十七分。”</p>
<p>Whittaker clearly thought I had gone mad.</p>
<p>惠特克显然认为我疯了。</p>
<p>'Don' t you see it's a clue？' I cried. 'Scudder knew where they were going to leave England. Tomorrow was the day，and it's somewhere where high tide is at 10. 17. '</p>
<p>“您没看到这是一条线索吗？”我大声说。“斯卡德尔知道他们会在那儿出发离开英格兰。就在明天，那个地方十点十七分涨潮。”</p>
<p>'Perhaps they've already gone tonight，'someone suggested.</p>
<p>“说不定他们今天晚上已经走了。”有人提醒说。</p>
<p>'Not them. They have their own secret way，and why should they hurry？They don't know that we're after them. Where can I get a book of Tide Tables？'</p>
<p>“他们不会。他们有自己的一套秘密方式，他们急什么？而且并不知道我们在跟踪。哪儿能搞到一本潮汐表？”</p>
<p>Whittaker looked happier. 'It's a chance，'he said. 'Let's go to the Navy Offices. '</p>
<p>惠特克显得振作起来。“这是个机会，”他说。“我们到海军部去。”</p>
<p>Sir Walter went off to Scotland Yard to get MacGilllvray. The rest of us drove to the Navy Offices where we went to a big room full of books and maps. We got a copy of the Tide Tables， and I sat down and looked through it while the others watched.</p>
<p>瓦尔特爵士去苏格兰场找麦吉里夫雷。其他人驱车前去海军部，我们到了一间大屋子，屋子满是书和地图。找到一本潮汐表，我坐下来一页页地翻，而其他人则在旁边看着。</p>
<p>It was no good. There were more than fifty places where high tide was at 10. 27. We needed more information than that.</p>
<p>没用。有五十多处涨潮时间是十点十七分。仅这一点不够，我们需要知道得多些。</p>
<p>I thought hard. What did Scudder mean by steps，and why was it so important to count them？ It must be somewhere with several paths going down to the sea. This path would be the only one with thirty－nine steps.</p>
<p>我苦思冥想。斯卡德尔说的台阶是什么意思，为什么数台阶那么重要？一定有个地方有几条路通往海边。唯有这条路有三十九级台阶。</p>
<p>I had another thought and checked the time of regular ships leaving England. There was no ship at 10. 17.</p>
<p>我又想出一个主意，于是核对从英格兰出发的班船时间。可是没有十点十七分的班船。</p>
<p>Why was high tide important？In a big harbour the tide doesn't matter. It is only important in a small harbour，or somewhere where there is no harbour at all.</p>
<p>为什么涨潮那么重要？在大港口潮汐并不重要。只有小港口，或者根本没有港口的地方才重要。</p>
<p>Then I thought about where a man would leave England if he were going to Germany. Not from the south coast， or the west coast， or Scotland. It would be somewhere on the east coast， probably between Cromer and Dover.</p>
<p>接着我考虑如果有人要去德国，他会在英格兰什么地方离岸。不会从南岸，或者西岸，或者从苏格兰离岸。而可能是东岸某处，也许在克罗默和多佛之间。</p>
<p>I am not Sherlock Holmes. But I am used to using my head，and when I guess， my guesses are often right.</p>
<p>我并非歇洛克&middot;福尔摩斯。但我好动脑筋，并且推测起来，往往都是对的。</p>
<p>I wrote out my ideas on a piece of paper：</p>
<p>我把想法写在一张纸上。</p>
<p>ALMOST CERTAIN</p>
<p>几乎肯定</p>
<p>（1） A place where there are several paths down to the sea.One of these has thirty－nine steps.</p>
<p>1.有个地方有几条路通往海边。其中一条有三十九级台阶。</p>
<p>（2） High tide at 10. 17p. m. A place where it is only possible for a ship to leave the coast at high tide.</p>
<p>2.涨潮时间是晚上十点十七分。某处，船只只有在涨潮时才能离岸。</p>
<p>（3） Probably not a harbour， but open coast with cliffs and a beach.</p>
<p>3.多半不是港口，而是有海滩和峭壁的开阔海岸。</p>
<p>（4）Ship probably a small one，a yacht or a fishing boat.</p>
<p>4.大概是条小船，游艇或者渔船。</p>
<p>（5） Somewhere on the east coast between Cromer and Dover.</p>
<p>5.在东岸克罗默和多佛之间的某处。</p>
<p>It seemed strange to be sitting at a table， watched by a groupof very important people， trying to understand something written by a dead man. But it was a matter of life or death to us.</p>
<p>我坐在桌旁写字，一群大人物注目旁观，极力想搞明白一个死人写的是什么东西，这情景很古怪。然而对我们来说这是生死攸关的大事。</p>
<p>Sir Walter and MacGillivray arrived. They had men watching all the harbours and railway stations with descriptions of the three men. But none of us thought that this would help</p>
<p>瓦尔特爵士和麦吉里夫雷来了。他们已经派人根据那三个人的相貌特征监视所有的港口和车站。没人认为会有什么用。</p>
<p>'Here's the best I can do，'I said. 'We have to find a place where there is a path with thirty－nine steps down to a beach. It must be somewhere on the east coast. Of course，it's somewhere where high tide is at 10. 17 tomorrow night. Who can we ask who knows the east coast really well？'</p>
<p>“我已尽力而为了，”我说。“我们必须找到一处，那里有三十九级台阶通往海边。还必须在东海岸。当然，这个地方明天晚上的涨潮时间是十点十七分。找谁问哪个人非常熟悉东岸？”</p>
<p>Whittaker said he knew a man who lived in south London. He went off in a car to get him and came back at about one o'clock in the morning with an old sailor who had worked all his life on the east coast.</p>
<p>惠特克说他认识一个住伦敦南部的人。他开车去找他，大约凌晨一点回来了，带着个老海员，这个人在东海岸干了一辈子。</p>
<p>'We want you to tell us about places you know on the east coast where there are cliffs and steps going down to the beach，'said Winstanley.</p>
<p>“我们想请您说说在东海岸哪些地方有峭壁和通往海滩的台阶。”温斯坦利说。</p>
<p>He thought for a minute or two. 'There are a lot of seaside towns-holiday places-where there are steps from the town down to the beach. '</p>
<p>他思考了一两分钟。“海边有许多村镇——度假地——那里都有台阶通往海滩。”</p>
<p>'No， that's not private enough，'I said.</p>
<p>“不，那不够隐秘，”我说。</p>
<p>'Well， I don't know. Of course， there's the Ruff—'</p>
<p>“那我就不知道了。当然，有个叫拉福的——”</p>
<p>'What's that？'</p>
<p>“什么？”</p>
<p>'It's in Kent，near Bradgate. There are cliffs with houses along the top-big houses. Some of the houses have steps down to a beach Mostly rich people live there， the sort of people who like to be private.</p>
<p>“在肯特，离布拉盖特很近。那有峭壁，房子建在峭壁顶上——都是大房子。一些房子有台阶通往海滩。多数是富人住在那里，就是那些喜欢隐秘的主儿们。”</p>
<p>I opened the Tide Tables at Bradgate. High tide was at 10. 27 on the 15th of June.</p>
<p>我打开布拉盖特的潮汐表。六月十五日那里的涨潮时间是十点二十七分。</p>
<p>'This looks hopeful，'I cried. 'How can I find out when high tide is at the Ruff？'</p>
<p>“看来有希望，”我叫了起来。“怎么找出拉福的涨潮时间？”</p>
<p>'I can tell you that， sir，'said the sailor. 'I used to go fishing there. High tide is ten minutes before Bradgate. '</p>
<p>“先生，这我可以告诉您，”那个海员说。“过去我常常到那里钓鱼。涨潮时间比布拉盖特早十分钟。”</p>
<p>I closed the book and looked up at the others.</p>
<p>我合上书，抬起头看着其他人。</p>
<p>'If one of those paths has thirty－nine steps， then I think we have a good chance，'I said. 'Can I take a car， Sir Walter， and a map？ If Mr MacGillivray can help me，perhaps we can prepare something for tomorrow. '</p>
<p>“如果有一条路是三十九级台阶的话，那么我想我们就有胜算了，”我说。“瓦尔特爵士，能给我辆车和一张地图吗？如果麦吉里夫雷先生能帮忙的话，也许可以为明天做些准备。”</p>
<p>It seemed strange for me to take control like this. But I was used to action， and they could see it. It was the Frenchman，Royer，who said what they were all thinking. 'I am quite happy，'he said，'to leave this business in Mr Hannay's hands. '</p>
<p>我这样指挥大家好像不伦不类。但本人敢做敢为，他们也可以看得出来。还是那个法国人罗耶说出了大家的心里话。他说：“我很高兴把这件事交给哈内先生去办。”</p>
<p>At half-past three in the morning I was driving through Kent in the moonlight，with MacGillivray next to me.</p>
<p>凌晨三点半我驱车在月色中穿过肯特，麦吉里夫雷就坐在我身边。</p><a href='10.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
