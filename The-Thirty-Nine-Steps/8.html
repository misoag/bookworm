<p><b>8 黑石来了 </b></p>
<p>Ⅰ came down to breakfast the next morning and found Sir Walter reading a coded message. He seemed less re－laxed than yesterday.</p>
<p>第二天早晨我下楼吃早饭，看到瓦尔特爵士正在看密码信。看来他没有昨天那么怡然自得。</p>
<p>I was very busy for an hour after you went to bed，'he said. 'I've arranged for the Frenchman， Royer，to come a day early. He will be in London at five o'clock. I don't think the change of day will help very much. If our enemies already knew he was coming，they will probably find out that the plans have changed. I would love to know how the news of his visit escaped. '</p>
<p>“您上床之后我又忙了一个小时。”他说。“我安排一个叫罗耶的法国人早一天来。他五点钟就到伦敦。但我觉得只变变日期没什么大用。如果敌人已知道他要来的话，他们就可能发现计划已经变了。要是知道他要来的消息是如何泄露出去的就好了。”</p>
<p>While I ate，he continued to talk. I was surprised that he was telling me all these important secrets.</p>
<p>我一边吃，他一边说。他把这么多重要的秘密都告诉我，出人意料。</p>
<p>'Can't the Navy's war plans be changed？'I asked.</p>
<p>“海军的作战计划难道不能变一变吗？”我问道。</p>
<p>'They could，'he said. 'But we want to avoid that. It would be very difficult，and some changes would be impossible. But the big problem is that they're not going to steal the plans in the street. They'll try to get the details without anybody knowing，and Royer will return to Paris thinking that every-thing is still secret. '</p>
<p>“可以的，”他说。“但是我们尽量不变。变起来相当困难，而且有些变化是做不到的。而最大的问题是他们不会在大街上偷这个计划。他们会设法神不知鬼不觉地搞到计划的细节，那样罗耶返回巴黎时还觉得一切仍然密不透风。”</p>
<p>'Then we must stay at Royer's side until he is home again，'I said.</p>
<p>“那么我们就必须帮助他直到他回去，”我说。</p>
<p>'Royer will meet us after dinner at my house in London：there'll be Whittaker from the Navy， myself，Sir Arthur Drew， and General Winstanley. The First Sea Lord，the head of the Navy，has been ill， and may not be able to come. Whittaker will give Royer the important papers， and then Royer will be driven to Portsmouth where a Navy ship will take him to France. He will be watched until he is back there. Whittaker will be watched while he has the papers before he meets Royer. It's the best we can do， and I don't see what can go wrong. But I'm very nervous because of the murder of Karolides. '</p>
<p>“饭后他会到我伦敦的家来见我们：还有海军的惠特克、我本人、亚瑟&middot;德鲁爵士、温斯坦利将军。海军第一大臣，也就是海军的首脑，生病了，可能来不了。惠特克要把一些重要文件交给罗耶，然后用车把罗耶送到朴次茅斯，在那儿海军的船把他送回法国。一路上都会有人监护他。惠特克拿着文件在会见罗耶之前也有人监护。我们能做的就这么多，我看不出能出什么纰漏。但是因为卡罗里德斯被杀，我觉得很没底。”</p>
<p>After breakfast he asked me to be his driver for the day.</p>
<p>早饭后他叫我今天替他开车。</p>
<p>'You know what these people are like， and I don't want to take risks. '</p>
<p>“您了解这是些什么人，所以我不想冒险。”</p>
<p>In London we went first to Scotland Yard where we met an important-looking policeman.</p>
<p>到伦敦我们首先去苏格兰场，在那儿见到一个相貌威严的警察。</p>
<p>'I've brought you the Langham Place murderer，'said Sir Walter.</p>
<p>“我给您带来了兰厄姆谋杀案的凶手。”瓦尔特爵士说。</p>
<p>The policeman smiled. 'I wish you had. I imagine you are Mr Hannay. We were very interested in you for a few days. '</p>
<p>那个警察笑了。“您要真带来就好了。我猜您是哈内先生。有那么几天我们对您很感兴趣。”</p>
<p>'Mr Hannay will interest you again， MacGillivray， but his story must wait twenty-four hours. But I would like you to tell Mr Hannay that you don't want to arrest him any more. '</p>
<p>“哈内先生会让您重新感兴趣的，麦吉利夫雷。但他的故事要等二十四个小时再说。而我想让您告诉哈内先生说您不会逮捕他了。”</p>
<p>'Of course we don't. 'The policeman turned to me. 'Your flat and your servant are waiting for you， although you may not want to return there. '</p>
<p>“当然不会逮捕了。”警察转身对我说：“您的寓所和仆人都在等着您，可大概您不想回那去了。”</p>
<p>As Sir Walter and I left， he said I was free for the rest of the day. 'Come and see me tomorrow， Hannay. I don't need to tell you to keep everything secret. You had better stay out of sight. If your Black Stone friends see you， there might be trouble. '</p>
<p>我和瓦尔特爵士离开那里，他告诉我这一天剩下的时间没我的事了。“哈内，明天请来看我。无需我说，一切要保守秘密。您最好别抛头露面。要是您那个黑石的朋友们看到您，恐怕就麻烦了。”</p>
<p>I didn't know what to do. It was strange to be a free man. I went to a very good restaurant for lunch，but I was still feeling nervous. When anybody looked at me， I wondered if they were thinking about the murder. I walked around London，thinking. I knew that by now Royer would be in England，and I felt sure that something terrible was going to happen and that only I could stop it. But it was not my business now.</p>
<p>而我不知道干些什么。重作自由人我很不习惯。我进了一家上等餐馆去吃午饭，可仍然感到惴惴不安。每逢有人看我，我就疑心他们想到了那件谋杀案。我心事重重地围着伦敦逛来逛去。我晓得罗耶现在已经在英格兰，而且肯定会发生什么骇人听闻的事件，而只有我才能制止。然而现在不关我的事了。</p>
<p>I didn't want to go back to my flat. I had to go back some time， but I decided to stay at a hotel tonight.</p>
<p>我不想回寓所。将来不回不行，而现在我决定今晚在旅馆里过夜。</p>
<p>I had supper in another restaurant， and thought that after that I would go to Sir Walter's house. He might not want me there， but I would feel happier if I went.</p>
<p>我在另一家餐馆里吃晚饭，计划完事后就到瓦尔特爵士家去。他不一定希望我现在去，但是去了我会感到舒服一点。</p>
<p>As I walked through London towards his house， I met a group of young men. One of them was Marmaduke Jopley.</p>
<p>我穿过伦敦去瓦尔特爵士的家，路上遇到一伙年轻人。其中有马默杜克&middot;乔普利。</p>
<p>'It's the murderer！' he cried. ' Stop him！ That's Hannay， the Langham Place murderer！'He took hold of my arm， and the others crowded round me.</p>
<p>“杀人犯！”他喊道。“抓住他！他就是哈内，兰厄姆的凶手！”他抓住我的胳膊，其它人把我围起来。</p>
<p>I didn't want trouble，but I was feeling angry. A policeman came up， and instead of explaining the mistake to him quietly and sensibly， I just hit out wildly at Marmaduke's stupid face. I felt much happier when he was lying on his back in the road. Then a general fight started， until the policeman got hold of me. I heard him ask what the matter was， and Marmaduke，talking through his broken teeth，told him that I was Hannay the murderer.</p>
<p>我不想找麻烦，但心里直冒火。一个警察走过来，我没向他心平气和、入情入理地解释他们如何不对，而是扬手照着马默杜克那张蠢脸狠狠揍去。看到他仰面朝天地躺在路上，我心里痛快多了。然后就是乱打一气，直到警察把我抓住才住手。我听警察问是怎么回事，马默杜克含着一口碎牙，告诉警察我就是那个杀人凶手哈内。</p>
<p>I was so angry that I pushed the policeman one way and one of Marmaduke's friends the other， and ran as fast as I could. There was shouting behind me，but I had escaped. I ran all the way to Sir Walter's house， walked up to the door and rang. I hoped the door would open quickly.</p>
<p>我愤怒已极，一手推开警察，一手推开马默杜克一个同伙，然后撒腿就跑。人们在背后喊我，但到底给我逃掉了。我一路跑到瓦尔特爵士家，走到门口按门铃。我盼着门快点打开。</p>
<p>It did.</p>
<p>门很快开了。</p>
<p>'I must see Sir Walter，'I said to the servant. 'It's desper ately important. '</p>
<p>“我必须见瓦尔特爵士，”我对仆人说，“有十分要紧的事。”</p>
<p>The servant let me in，and then shut the door behind me. 'Sir Walter is in a meeting，sir. Perhaps you will wait. '</p>
<p>仆人放我进来，然后关上门。“先生，瓦尔特爵士正在开会。也许您要等一会儿。”</p>
<p>There was a telephone and one or two chairs in the hall，and I sat down there.</p>
<p>大厅里有一部电话，一两张椅子，于是我坐了下来。</p>
<p>'Listen，'I whispered to the servant. 'I'm in a bit of trouble，but I'm working for Sir Walter. If anyone comes to the door and asks for me， tell them I'm not here. '</p>
<p>“听着，”我小声对仆人说。“我遇到点麻烦，而我是为瓦尔特爵士干事的。如果有人来敲门找我，告诉他们我不在这儿。”</p>
<p>There was a sudden ringing at the door， and he went to open it. He told them whose house it was，and that nobody could come in，and then shut the door.</p>
<p>门上的铃突然响起来，他过去开门。告诉他们这是谁的家，并说不能入内，然后把门关上。</p>
<p>A few minutes later there was another ring at the door， and the servant did not hesitate to let this visitor in. Everybody knew his face from the newspapers—a square， grey beard and bright blue eyes Lord Alloa，the First Sea Lord，and head of the British Navy.</p>
<p>过了几分钟又响起了门铃，仆人爽快地放客人进来。人们在报纸上熟悉了他的面孔——四方脸、灰胡子、蓝眼睛炯炯有神。他就是阿罗勋爵，第一海军大臣，英国海军的首脑。</p>
<p>He was shown into a room at the end of the hall. I sat there for twenty minutes. Surely the meeting would end soon；Royer must leave for Portsmouth by eleven o'clock.</p>
<p>他被领进大厅一头的屋子里。我在那儿坐了二十分钟。会议肯定快完了；因为罗耶必须在十一点离开去朴次茅斯。</p>
<p>Then the door opened again and the First Sea Lord came out. He walked past me， and in passing he looked at me and for a second I looked into his eyes. It was only for a second，but my heart jumped. The First Sea Lord had never seen me before， but in his eyes I saw that he recognized me. Then he passed me and was out of the door into the street.</p>
<p>门又开了，第一海军大臣走出来。他走过我身边，顺便看了我一眼，同时我也盯着他的眼睛看了一下。就看了那么一下，我的心就剧跳起来。这位第一海军大臣以前根本没有见过我，但从他的眼神里我知道他已经认出了我。他从我身边走过，出了门走上大街。</p>
<p>I picked up the telephone book and looked up the number of Lord Alloa's house. I spoke to one of his servants.</p>
<p>我拿起电话薄，查阿罗勋爵家的电话号码。和他的仆人通话。</p>
<p>'Is Lord Alloa at home？'I asked.</p>
<p>“阿罗勋爵在家吗？”我问道。</p>
<p>'Yes， but he's ill and has been in bed all day. Do you want to leave a message， sir？'</p>
<p>“在家，可是他病了，一整天躺在床上。先生，您要留口信吗？”</p>
<p>I put down the telephone and sat down， shaking. My part in this business was not finished. I walked straight into the room where the others were meeting.</p>
<p>我放下电话，坐下来，浑身战栗。这出戏我扮演的角色还没有完。我闯进屋子，人们正在屋里开会。</p>
<p>Sir Walter looked surprised and annoyed. 'I'm afraid that this is not a good time， Mr Hannay. '</p>
<p>看到我瓦尔特勋爵吃了一惊，样子很不高兴。“您这时候进来恐怕不大好吧，哈内先生。”</p>
<p>'I think it is，'I answered. 'Tell me， please， who left this room a minute ago. '</p>
<p>“我觉得好，”我答道。“请告诉我刚才离开屋的是谁。”</p>
<p>'Lord Alloa，'said Sir Walter，looking angrier.</p>
<p>“阿罗勋爵，”瓦尔特爵士说，他脸上的怒色更重了。</p>
<p>'It Was not，'I cried. 'It looked like him but it was not him. It was a man who recognized me， who has seen me in the last month. I've just telephoned Lord Alloa' s house and he's been ill in bed all day. '</p>
<p>“不是，”我喊道。“看着像他，但不是他。这个人认出我了，这个月他见过我。我刚才给阿罗勋爵家打了电话，他病了，一天没起床。”</p>
<p>'Who…'someone asked.</p>
<p>“谁……”有人问。</p>
<p>'The Black Stone，'I cried， sitting down，and looking at five frightened men.</p>
<p>“黑石，”我喊着，坐下来望着那五位吓得直呆呆的官员。</p><a href='9.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
