<p><b>4 政治候选人。 </b></p>
<p>I drove that car across the moor as fast as I could，looking nervously over my shoulder. I was also thinking desperately about Scudder's notes.</p>
<p>我开车飞速穿越荒原，同时战战兢兢地回头张望，心里极力思考着斯卡德尔笔记本里的事。</p>
<p>Scudder had told me nothing but lies. All his stories about south-east Europe and people wanting to start wars were rubbish. But although he had told me lies，there was truth underneath.</p>
<p>斯卡德尔给我讲的全是谎话。什么东南欧、什么有人要发动战争，纯属胡说八道。他讲的虽然是假话，但其中也隐藏着真相。</p>
<p>The 15th of June was going to be an important day，but because of something more important than the murder of a Prime Minister. The story in his book was not complete，and there were some things I didn't understand-for example，the words 'thirty-nine steps'，which appeared five or six times. The last time the words were used，Scudder had written'Thirty-nine steps，I counted them-high tide at 10∶17 p. m. '</p>
<p>六月十五日将是个重要的日期，因为那天会发生某件事，比谋杀希腊首相更要紧。他笔记本里的记述断续不全，有些事我也不明白——比如，“三十九级台阶”这几个词出现了五六次。最后一次斯卡德尔用这几个词时，他写道：“三十九级，我数了——涨潮时间，下午十点十七分。”</p>
<p>The first thing I learned was that war was certain. Everything was planned. Karolides was going to be murdered and nothing could prevent it.</p>
<p>我搞明白的第一件事是战争肯定要爆发。一切都计划好了。卡罗里德斯死定了，无可挽救。</p>
<p>The second thing I learned was that Britain was not prepared for war. Karolides would be murdered and war would seem certain. Germany would pretend to be against war，but while we and they discussed peace，their submarines would silently fill the seas around us.</p>
<p>我搞明白的第二件事是英国对战争没有准备。卡罗里德斯将被杀死，而且战争看来不可避免。德国会装出反对战争的样子，一边和我们探讨和平，同时悄悄把潜艇布满周围海域。</p>
<p>There was something else. Although the newspapers didn't know it，the British and French governments were close allies，and had agreed to prepare for war together. The most important officers in the armies and navies met regularly，and in June one of the top people was coming from Paris for a meeting. He would be told the exact details of the British Navy's preparations for war.</p>
<p>此外，英国和法国是亲密的盟友，有协议要共同备战，但是报界对此并不知情。双方陆、海军的高级军官定期会晤，六月份巴黎方面某个首脑人物要来开会。他将被告知英国海军备战的详细情况。</p>
<p>But on the 15th of June other people were going to be in London. Scudder didn't give names，but called them just the 'Black Stone'. They had a plan to get hold of this information，which was meant only for the French Government. And the information would be used by our enemies just a week or two later，with a most terrible effect.</p>
<p>然而，六月十五日另外一批人也要到伦敦来。斯卡德尔没说他们叫什么，只称他们为“黑石”。他们制定了计划要把会晤情报搞到手，而这些情况只能让法国政府知道。一两周之后敌人会利用这个情报，那后果将不堪设想。</p>
<p>My first idea was to write a letter to the British Prime Minister. But nobody would believe my story. I had to find proof that Scudder's story was true；and this would not be easy with the police and the Black Stone following me.</p>
<p>我第一个想法是给英国首相写封信。但是没有人会相信我的话。我必须找到证据说明斯卡德尔的话是真的；这可不那么容易，因为警察和黑石正在跟踪着我。</p>
<p>I drove to the east through a country at peace；but I knew that in a month's time，unless I was very lucky，men would be lying dead in this quiet countryside. I came into a village and I saw a policeman standing outside the Post Office and reading something carefully. He looked up at the car，stepped into the road，and held up a hand to stop me.</p>
<p>我开车向东通过宁静的乡村；而我清楚一个月之内，除非我幸运成事，否则这片宁静的乡野会横尸遍地。我驶进一个村庄，看到一个警察站在邮电局外面，正在专心致志地读着什么。他一抬头看到我的车，便走到路中央扬手示意叫我停车。</p>
<p>I almost did stop. But then I realized that the policeman had been reading about me. I supposed the police at the hotel had worked quickly and contacted all the local villages. I drove faster，the policeman jumped out of my way，and I was soon out of the village.</p>
<p>我差点停下来。但是转念一想，意识到警察刚才读的是有关我的消息。我猜到旅店的警察动作很迅速，已通知了各村的警察。我突然加速，吓得警察从路上跳开，转眼我便驶离村庄。</p>
<p>I left the main road as soon as possible and tried a smaller one. It was not easy without a map，and I realized that I had been stupid to steal the car. It would help the police and the Black Stone to find me in any corner of Scotland. If I left it，and went off on foot，they would find me in an hour or two.</p>
<p>我尽快地从大路拐到小路看看情况。而没有地图谈何容易，我意识到偷这辆车是做了件蠢事。在苏格兰我无论躲到那个角落，这辆车都会帮着警察和黑石把我找到。如果弃车步行，他们一两个小时内也会找到我。</p>
<p>I took a road that went along a narrow valley，and then up onto the moor again. I was very hungry；I had eaten nothing since morning. And now，as I drove，I heard a noise in the sky，and there was the plane.</p>
<p>我驶向一条狭窄的山谷路，然后折身返回荒原。我从早晨就滴水未进，现在饥肠辘辘。我正开着车，听到空中有响声，是那架飞机。</p>
<p>On the moor it would see me in a minute. I drove as fast as I could down into another valley and towards a wood. Suddenly，a car appeared in front of me from a side road. There was no time to stop. I did the only thing possible and drove off the road into a hedge，hoping to hit something soft beyond. But I was out of luck. The car went through the hedge like a knife through butter，and immediately began to fall. I jumped out and was caught by the branch of a tree，while the car disappeared into a river fifteen metres below.</p>
<p>在荒原上飞机转眼就会看到我。我尽快驶向另一个峡谷，然后奔树林而去。猛然间，从岔路上一辆汽车窜到我面前。停车已来不及了。唯一可能的是驶离道路，冲入篱墙，希望能撞在后面什么软东西上。然而我非常不走运。汽车穿过篱墙，一如餐刀切黄油般爽利，然后马上向下跌落。我跳了出来，被挂在一个树枝上，而汽车消失在下面十五米的河中。</p>
<p>A hand helped me out of the tree，and a frightened voice asked me if I was badly hurt. The speaker was a young man who was very alarmed and very sorry. I was more pleased than angry；it was a good way for the car to disappear.</p>
<p>有一只手帮我从树上下来，我听到一个战战兢兢的声音问我是否伤得很重。说话的是个年轻人，他很吃惊也很歉疚。我与其说愤懑不如说欣慰，汽车这样消失很不错。</p>
<p>'It's my fault，'I told him. 'That's the end of my holiday，but that's better than the end of my life！'</p>
<p>“这是我的错，”我对他说。“这一下假期算完了，但总比命没了好！”</p>
<p>He looked at his watch. 'I'm in a hurry，but my house is very near. Let me give you some food and a bed. But what about your luggage？Is it in the river？'</p>
<p>他看了看表。“我正忙着，但我家很近。让我给您提供吃住吧。可是您的行李怎么办？掉在河里了？”</p>
<p>'It's in my pocket，'I said. 'I'm from Australia，so I never carry much luggage. '</p>
<p>“行李在我口袋里，”我说。“我从澳大利亚来，从来不多带行李。”</p>
<p>'From Australia，'he cried. 'You're just the man I need. '</p>
<p>“从澳大利亚来，”他叫了起来。“我正需要您这么个人。”</p>
<p>We got into his car and in three minutes we were at his very comfortable house. He found some food for me. 'You've only got five minutes，I'm afraid，but you can eat properly after wards. We've got to be at the meeting at eight o'clock. You see，I'm a candidate for the election and I've got a problem tonight. I had arranged for Crumpleton，who was the Australian Prime Minister，to speak at the meeting tonight，but he's ill. I've got to speak for forty minutes，and I don't know what to say. Listen，My-you haven't told me your name-Twisdon，you say？Well，Mr Twisdon，can you talk about Australia for a few minutes？'</p>
<p>我们坐上他的车，三分钟就来到他那舒适的家。他给我找了些吃的。“恐怕您只能吃五分钟，不过以后您可以好好吃一顿。八点我们必须去开会。您知道，我是这次选举的候选人，而今天晚上我遇到个麻烦。我今晚本来安排的是克兰姆坡顿讲话，他是澳大利亚的总理，可他病了。这样我就要讲四十分钟，但不知道讲些什么。听我说，先生……您还没告诉我您叫什么呢……叫特维斯顿，对吧？好了，特维斯顿先生，您能不能用几分钟讲讲澳大利亚？”</p>
<p>It seemed strange to ask a man you had met in a car crash to speak at an election meeting，but I needed his help.</p>
<p>车祸中你碰到个人，就拉他在选举会上讲话，真是不可思议，可我要他帮忙埃</p>
<p>'All right，'I said. 'I'm not a good speaker，but I'll speak for a bit. '</p>
<p>“好吧，”我说。“我讲不好，不过可以讲一会儿。”</p>
<p>He was delighted. We got in his car，and on the way to the meeting he told me about his life. His name was Sir Harry Andrews and his uncle was in the government and had suggested politics as a job. He knew nothing about politics，but he was a friendly young man and I was glad to help him. When we arrived at the meeting，there were about five hundred people waiting. I was introduced as a'trusted Australian leader'and then Sir Harry started to speak. It was mostly about preparing for war. He said the Germans didn't want a war and that if we stopped building new warships， the Germans would do the same. I thought about Scudder's black book in my pocket.</p>
<p>他很高兴。我们坐进汽车，去开会的路上他把他的情况讲给我听。他叫哈里&middot;安德鲁爵士，他叔叔在政府工作，劝他也从政。而他对政治一窍不通，但他年轻，为人和善，我很愿意帮助他。我们赶到会场，已经有五百来人等在那儿。我作为“可信赖的澳大利亚领导人”被介绍给大家，接着哈里爵士开始讲话。内容主要是如何备战。他说德国人并不想打仗，如果我们停止建造军舰，德国人也会同样做。我则想着口袋里斯卡德尔小笔记本上的事。</p>
<p>But behind all the rubbish I could see that Sir Harry was a nice man. And he spoke very badly. I knew I wasn't a good speaker，but I would be better than him.</p>
<p>除了这一番胡言乱语，我可以看出哈里爵士为人不错。而讲话相当糟糕。我知道自己演讲水平也不怎么样，但总比他讲得好。</p>
<p>I simply told them everything I knew about Australia. I said that Britain and Australia must work together and be friends. I think I was rather a success.</p>
<p>关于澳大利亚，我把知道的一古脑儿都端了出来。我讲到英国和澳大利亚要同舟共济，友好相处。我觉得我的讲话挺成功。</p>
<p>When we were back in his car again， Sir Harry was delight－ed. 'You spoke wonderfully，Twisdon，'he said. 'Now you must stay for a few days. There's excellent fishing here. '</p>
<p>我们回到车上时，哈里爵士兴高采烈。“您讲得棒极了，特维斯顿，”他说。“您必须在这里呆几天。这有一个刮刮叫的垂钓活动。”</p>
<p>We had a good supper-which I needed-and sat in front of a fire in his sitting－room. I thought the time had come for me to tell the truth and see if this man could help me.</p>
<p>我们吃了一顿丰盛的晚餐——这正是我之所需——然后一块坐在客厅的火炉前。我觉得这正是把实情告诉他的时机，看此人能不能帮我一把。</p>
<p>'Listen，Sir Harry，I've got something very important to say to you. You're an honest man，and I'm going to be honest too. Everything you said tonight was dangerous rubbish. '</p>
<p>“听我说，哈里爵士，我有非常重要的事情跟您说。您是个实在人，我也同样会实实在在。今天晚上您讲的都是危险的无稽之谈。”</p>
<p>'Was it？I wasn't sure myself. Do you think Germany is going to start a war with us？'</p>
<p>“是吗？我自己还说不准。您认为德国要和我们开战吗？”</p>
<p>'In six weeks' time you won't need to ask me that Listen， and I'll tell you a story. '</p>
<p>“六周之后您就不必问我了。听我说，我给您讲一件事。”</p>
<p>I sat in front of the fire，in that peaceful room，and told him everything. He heard about Scudder， his notebook， the milk－man， and my travels in Scotland. It was the first time I had told the truth，all of it， to anyone， and I felt better.</p>
<p>在那间宁静的屋子里，我坐在火炉前，把一切都告诉了他。他听着关于斯卡德尔、以及他的小笔记本、送奶员、以及我在苏格兰的历程。这是头一回我把真相，一切真相，告诉别人，心里感到好多了。</p>
<p>'So you see，' I said finally，'I'm the man the police want for the Langham Place murder. You should call them at once.</p>
<p>“您知道了，”末了我说，“我就是兰厄姆命案中警察要抓的那个人。您应该立刻报警。”</p>
<p>He looked at me carefully. 'I know you're not a murderer，Hannay， and I believe you're speaking the truth. I'll help you. What do you want me to do？'</p>
<p>他审视着我。“我知道您不是凶手，相信您说的是实话。我会帮助您的。您需要我做什么？”</p>
<p>'First，write to your uncle. I must contact the government before the 15th of June. '</p>
<p>“首先给您叔叔写封信。六月十五日前我必须和政府取得联系。”</p>
<p>He pulled his moustache. 'That won't help you. My uncle isn't interested in foreign politics， and I don't think he'd be－lieve you. No. I'll write to a friend of his，Sir Walter Bulli-vant， who works in the Foreign Office . He's an intelligent man and I think he'd help. What shall I say？'</p>
<p>他捋着胡子。“那对您没用。我叔叔对外国政治没有兴趣，我觉得他不会相信您。不。我会给他一位朋友写封信，他叫瓦尔特&middot;布利万特爵士，在外交部工作。他很聪明，我想他会帮助您的。怎么样？”</p>
<p>So he wrote a letter to Sir Walter， saying that if a man named Twisdon came to him， he should help him. Twisdon would say the words 'Black Stone'and would whistle the song ' Annie Laurie'， to prove who he was.</p>
<p>于是他给布利万特爵士写了封信，信中说如果有个叫特维斯顿的人去找他，他应予帮助。特维斯顿会说暗语“黑石”，还会用口哨吹那首叫“安妮&middot;劳里”的歌以证明他是谁。</p>
<p>He told me where Sir Walter lived， and asked me what more he could do.</p>
<p>他告诉我布利万特爵士的地址，又问还需要他做什么。</p>
<p>'Can you lend me some old clothes and give me a map？ And if the police come， show them the car in the river. '</p>
<p>“您能借给我几件旧衣服再给我一张地图吗？再有，如果警察找来，领他们看看掉在河里的汽车。”</p>
<p>I then slept for three or four hours， until Sir Harry woke me at two o'clock. He gave me an old bicycle for the first part of the journey.</p>
<p>然后我睡了三四个小时，两点钟哈里爵士把我叫醒。他给了我一辆旧自行车以供我第一段路程之用。</p><a href='5.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
