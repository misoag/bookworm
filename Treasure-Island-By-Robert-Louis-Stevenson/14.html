<p><b>14 寻宝记 </b></p>
<p>We went back to eat our breakfast．</p>
<p>我们回去吃了早餐。</p>
<p>‘They have the ship，’Silver told the men，‘and I don't know where it is．But once we have the treasure，we'll find it soon enough．I'll keep the boy close by me when we look for the treasure；then，when we have both ship and treasure，we'll persuade Jim to join us，and give him some of the treasure for all his help．’</p>
<p>“他们有船，”西尔弗说，“我不知道在哪儿。但我们一旦找到宝藏，很快就会找到船。我们寻宝时我会把这孩子带在身边；然后，我们会同时拥有船和宝藏，我们会说服吉姆入伙，分给他一些财宝。”</p>
<p>The men were happy，but I was afraid．If Silver's plan came true，he would forget Dr Livesey and the others，I was sure And if things went wrong，how could a boy and a one-legged man fight five strong men？</p>
<p>那伙人都挺高兴，我却害怕起来。如果西尔弗的计划成真的话，他肯定会忘掉李甫西大夫和其他人。而事情如果搞砸了，一个孩子和一个瘸子哪敌得过五个壮汉？</p>
<p>When we left the stockade，everyone had weapons except me．Silver had two guns；and the parrot，Captain Flint，sat on his shoulder．There was a rope around me and I followed after Silver，who held the other end．</p>
<p>我们离开寨子，除我之外每个人都带着武器。西尔弗带着两枝枪；那只名叫弗林特船长的鹦鹉在他肩上。我跟在他身后，腰里拴着一根绳子，另一端在他手里。</p>
<p>Some of the men carried spades，others food and rum，and we made our way to the beach where the two boats were waiting．The men talked about the map．The cross was too large to be of much help，and the words on the back of the map were no better．</p>
<p>其余的人拿着镐，食物，还有朗姆酒。我们来到停着两只小船的岸边。他们讨论着地图上的标记。叉画得太大了，表示不了确切地点，背面的说明文字也好不到哪儿去。</p>
<p>Tall tree．Spyglass shoulder，to the North of North-North-East．</p>
<p>望远镜肩上一棵大树，方位北北东偏北骷髅岛，东南东偏东。</p>
<p>Skeleton Island East-South-East and by East．We landed the boats at the mouth of the second river，then began to climb Spyglass Hill．Silver and I followed a long way behind the rest，and I had to help him．We were near the top when a man on the left cried aloud．The others started to run towards him．</p>
<p>我们把小船停在第二条河的河口处上岸，然后开始爬望远镜山。西尔弗和我远远落在这伙人的后面，我还得帮他。我们快到山顶时，左边一个人大叫一声，大伙都向他跑去。</p>
<p>‘He can't have found the treasure，’said Morgan．</p>
<p>“他不可能已发现了宝藏，”摩根说。</p>
<p>And indeed it was something very different—the bones of a human skeleton，a few pieces of clothing still on it．Cold fear filled every heart．</p>
<p>的确是件完全不同的事，地上有一具死人的骨架，上面还留着一些衣服的碎片。每个人心里都一阵颤栗。</p>
<p>‘He was a seaman，’said George Merry．</p>
<p>“他是一个水手，”乔治&middot;墨利说。</p>
<p>‘Yes，’agreed Silver But look at the way those bones are lying—it isn't natural．’The man lay perfectly straight—his feet pointing one way，his hands，over his head，pointing the opposite way．‘I've got an idea，’said Silver．‘Look！We can see the top of Skeleton Island from here．These bones are a pointer，telling us which way to go！’</p>
<p>“是，”西尔弗说。“不过看看这骨架的姿势，好像很不自然。”死人躺得笔直，脚指着一个方向，手举过头指着相反的方向。“我有个主意，”西尔弗说。“我们从这儿可以看见骷髅岛的顶部，这骨架为我们指明了方向！”</p>
<p>He was right．Our compass showed that the body pointed straight towards Skeleton Island，and in a line East-South-East and by East．</p>
<p>他是对的。指南针显示死人正好指向骷髅岛，方位正好是东南东偏东。</p>
<p>We left the skeleton behind，but now the pirates kept together and talked in frightened whispers．At the top of the hill，Silver took out his compass again．</p>
<p>我们离开骨架，但现在海盗们都聚在一起走了，有时还害怕地嘀咕着什么。到山顶的时候，西尔弗又拿出了罗盘。</p>
<p>‘There are three tall trees，’he said，‘in about the right place．Spyglass shoulder must be that lower place，there．A child could find the treasure now！’</p>
<p>“那边有三棵大树，”他说。“大约就是那地方。‘望远镜的肩膀’肯定就是那片低地。现在连小孩都能找到宝藏了！”</p>
<p>Suddenly，out of the middle of the trees in front of us，a high shaking voice began to sing：</p>
<p>正在这时，从我们前方的树林里，传出带着颤音的水手老调：</p>
<p>Fifteen men on the dead man's chest----</p>
<p>十五个人趴着死人箱——</p>
<p>Yo-ho-ho，and a bottle of rum！</p>
<p>唷呵呵，朗姆酒一瓶，快来尝！</p>
<p>The effect on the pirates was terrible to see．The colour went from their six faces，and they caught hold of each other like frightened children．Morgan fell to the ground，trembling with fear．</p>
<p>那帮海盗们的丑态真是惨不忍睹。他们六个人都变了脸色，互相抓着，像受惊的孩子一样。摩根趴在地上，吓得直发抖。</p>
<p>‘It's Flint！’cried George Merry．</p>
<p>“是弗林特！”乔治&middot;墨利叫道。</p>
<p>‘No！’said Silver，fighting to get the word out．‘It's someone playing games----it's no ghost！’</p>
<p>“不！”西尔弗好不容易才说出来。“有人闹着玩，不是鬼魂。”</p>
<p>Then the voice came again：‘Darby M’Graw！’it screamed．‘Darby M’Graw！Fetch the rum！’</p>
<p>不一会又传来那声音：“达比&middot;麦克格雷！”声音尖厉。“达比&middot;麦克格雷，拿朗姆酒来！”</p>
<p>The pirates were fixed to the ground after the voice died away，their staring eyes full of horror．</p>
<p>那帮海盗站在那里一动不动，像脚下生了根，眼里充满了恐惧。</p>
<p>‘That does it！’said one．‘Let's go！’</p>
<p>“这就是了！”有人说。“咱们走吧！”</p>
<p>‘Those were Flint's last words before he died，’cried Morgan．</p>
<p>“那是弗林特死前最后一句话，”摩根喊道。</p>
<p>‘I'm here to get that treasure，’shouted Silver，‘and I'll not be beaten by man or ghost！I was never afraid of Flint in his life and，by thunder，I'll face him dead！There's seven hundred thousand pounds not a quarter of a mile from here．I'll not leave that much money for a drunken old seaman----him dead，too！And there's something strange．There was an echo，and no man ever saw a ghost with a shadow，so why should a ghost's voice have an echo？It's not natural．’</p>
<p>“我来这儿是寻宝，”西尔弗嚷道。“我不会被什么人或鬼打败！妈的，我也不怕他的鬼魂。离这儿不到1／4英里有70万英镑。不能因为碰上个死了的老醉鬼就扔掉这么多财宝不要埃而且有点怪。刚才的声音有回音，而且也没人看见过鬼魂还有影子。为什么鬼魂的声音还有回音？这很奇怪。”</p>
<p>The words calmed George Merry．‘Yes，that's right，’he said．‘Now I think about it，it was like Flint's voice，but not exactly like it．It was like another person's voice…more like----’</p>
<p>这些话让乔治&middot;墨利平静了一些。“没错，”他说。“我现在想起来了。那声音很像弗林特的，但又不确切。挺像另一个人的声音……更像——”</p>
<p>‘Ben Gunn！’shouted Silver．</p>
<p>“本&middot;葛恩！”西尔弗叫道。</p>
<p>‘If it was，it's still a ghost，’said Dick．‘Ben Gunn's not here in body，any more than Flint is．’</p>
<p>“如果是的话，也还是鬼魂的声音，”迪克说。“本&middot;葛恩也是个死人，和弗林特一样。”</p>
<p>But the older men laughed．‘Nobody minds Ben Gunn，Dead or alive，’cried George．</p>
<p>年长的几个人笑起来。墨利嚷道：“谁也不把本&middot;葛恩放在眼里，不管他是死是活，谁也不怕他。”</p>
<p>The men were happy again，the colour back in their faces as they talked together and began to walk on．George Merry went first，leading the way with Silver's compass．</p>
<p>那帮人又高兴起来，脸上渐渐有了血色，他们开始边说边赶路。乔治&middot;墨利走在前面，拿着西尔弗的罗盘领路。</p>
<p>We reached the first tall tree，but it was the wrong one．So was the second．The third was tall enough to be seen from the sea，both east and west of the island．My companions hurried on，desperate to get their hands on the seven hundred thousand pounds in gold which lay somewhere under the tree's shadows．</p>
<p>我们走到第一棵大树下，但证明是错的。第二棵也是如此。第三棵树很高，从东西两面的海上都能看见。我的同行者们急忙赶过去，一心想得到藏在树阴下的70万英镑财宝。</p>
<p>Silver pulled at the rope that held me，and turned his eyes upon me with a deadly look．I could read his thoughts．So near to the gold now，everything was forgotten—his promise and the doctor's warning．I knew he hoped to take the treasure，cut every honest throat on that island，find and board the Hispaniola at night，and sail away a rich man and a murderer．</p>
<p>西尔弗拽着绳子，恶狠狠地瞪着我。我明白他的心思。现在离宝藏越来越近了，他忘了一切——他的保证和大夫的劝告。我知道他希望找到宝藏后杀掉每一个诚实的人，晚上找到伊斯帕尼奥拉号逃掉，做一个富翁和杀人犯。</p>
<p>Suddenly，George Merry shouted，‘All together，boys！’，and the men began to run．Not ten metres farther on they stopped and cried out．Silver moved quickly，and the next moment we were with them Before us was a large hole，but it was not a new hole because grass grew on the bottom．</p>
<p>忽然，乔治&middot;墨利喊道：“都过来！”大家都跑过去。不出十米大伙都停下来惊叫起来。西尔弗迅速过去，我们很快和他们在一起了。在我们面前是个大洞，显然不是新挖的，因为底部长满了野草。</p>
<p>There was no treasure．</p>
<p>洞里没有宝藏。</p>
<p>The seven hundred thousand pounds had gone！</p>
<p>价值70万英镑的财宝不翼而飞了！</p><a href='15.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
