<p><b>11 海上历险 </b></p>
<p>The doctor，Gray and I ran back into the house．We saw Hunter lying still，after a knock on the head．Joyce lay dead，shot through the head；and the squire was half-carrying the wounded captain．</p>
<p>我和李甫西大夫，还有葛雷跑回小木屋里。我们看见亨特躺着一动不动，他的头被重重地击了一下。乔伊斯躺在地上死去了，他头上中了弹，乡绅则搀着受伤的船长。</p>
<p>The pirates did not return，and we had time to take care of the wounded．Out of the eight men who fell in the fight，only three still breathed．One pirate，Hunter，and Captain Smollett；and of these，the first two were nearly dead．The pirate died first，then Hunter only a few hours later．</p>
<p>海盗们并没有反击，所以我们有时间来治疗伤员。这场战斗中倒下的八个人中有三个还没咽气。一个海盗，亨特，还有斯摩列特船长；他们中前两个都快死了。海盗先死了，过了几个小时亨特也死了。</p>
<p>The captain's wounds were bad but not dangerous．The doctor told him he must not walk or move his arm，and to speak only when it was necessary．</p>
<p>船长伤得挺重但并不危险。大夫告诉他不能走动也不能动胳膊，只在必要的时候才能说话。</p>
<p>After dinner，the squire and the doctor sat by the captain's side and talked．Then，a little past noon，the doctor took his hat，his pistols and a sword，put the map in his pocket，and walked off quickly through the trees．</p>
<p>午饭后，乡绅和大夫在船长身边坐下来商讨军情。时间刚过正午，大夫拿起帽子和枪，还有一把短剑，把地图放在口袋里，迅速地消失在树林里。</p>
<p>I guessed he was going to see Ben Gunn，and thought the doctor was lucky to be walking in the cool shadows of the wood．The house was hot and smelt of blood，and there were dead bodies lying all around．Suddenly，I wanted to get away from that place----and I had an idea！I would go and look for Ben Gunn's boat！Perhaps we would need it some time．That was my excuse to myself，although I knew it was wrong of me to leave only two unwounded men to guard the stockade．It was also wrong of me to leave secretly，but that is what I did．</p>
<p>我猜测他是去和本&middot;葛恩碰头的。我甚至羡慕他走在树林的阴凉里。木屋里热得很，周围有那么多的血，横着那么多尸体。忽然间我想逃离这地方——我有了主意！我去看看本&middot;葛恩的小船。也许我们什么时候用得着它。这只是我自己的借口而已，我知道只留下两个未受伤的人守卫木屋是错误的。而且我这次擅自行动也是不合适的，但我还是这样做了。</p>
<p>I filled my pockets with bread，then took two pistols and the powder for them．When Gray and Mr Trelawney were helping the captain，I climbed quickly out of the stockade and ran into the trees．</p>
<p>我把两只口袋装满了面包，然后拿了两把手枪，带上足够的弹药。乡绅和葛雷正忙于照顾船长的时候，我迅速爬出木屋，跑进了树林。</p>
<p>I made my way towards the east coast．It was late in the afternoon，but still warm．Soon cool air began to reach me，and suddenly there was the sea．I walked along the edge，then up to a small sand-covered hill．</p>
<p>我一直向东海岸走去。已经是下午晚些时候了，还是那么热。不久凉爽的风阵阵袭来，我突然到了海边。我沿着海边走去，走上一个沙子覆盖的小山。</p>
<p>Ben Gunn had told me his boat was hidden near the white rock，and I found that rock farther along the beach．The little boat was hidden in the grass----a small，rough thing，made of wood and goat-skins．</p>
<p>本&middot;葛恩告诉过我他的小船藏在白岩石附近，我在远处的海边找到了那岩石。小船藏在草丛中——是木头和山羊皮制成的船，又小又粗糙。</p>
<p>I knew I should go back to the stockade now，but an idea came to me and I sat down to wait for darkness．As the last of the day disappeared，there were two lights in the blackness．One came from a great fire on the shore where the pirates sat singing and drinking；the other came from the Hispaniola out at sea．</p>
<p>我知道我应该立刻回到寨子里去，但一种意念驱使我坐下来等着天黑。在落日的最后一丝余光消失之后，我只能看见两点火光。一个是岸上海盗们巨大的篝火堆，海盗们围着篝火喝酒，唱歌；另一个来自海面上的伊斯帕尼奥拉号。</p>
<p>I put the small boat on my shoulders and carried it to the edge of the water，then I put it in the sea．It was a very safe boat，but difficult to control．It turned every way except the one I wanted to go！</p>
<p>我把小船扛在肩上运到水边，放在海里。这只船非常安全，但极难控制，它就是不朝我要去的方向前进！</p>
<p>The sea carried me out to the Hispaniola．I knew if I cut the anchor rope at the wrong moment，the Hispaniola would make a sudden move out to sea，and my boat might be knocked out of the water．So I took my knife and cut almost through the rope，then waited，listening to the sound of two loud voices coming from the cabin．Both men sounded drunk，and both were angry．</p>
<p>我在海上向伊斯帕尼奥拉号划去。我知道如果我在错误的时刻砍断绳索，伊斯帕尼奥拉号就会突然离岸，我的小船也势必倾覆。我抽出刀来一股一股地割绳索，在绳索将断时稍停片刻。我听见船舱里有两个人高声谈话。两个人好像喝醉了，而且都怒气冲冲的。</p>
<p>At last the wind turned the ship towards me and now I cut all the way through the rope．As fast as I could，I pushed my little boat along the side of the ship，desperate to get away before the ship crashed into me．Just as I gave the final push，my hand found a rope over the end of the ship．</p>
<p>终于又来了一阵风，大船向我靠近了一些，于是我割断了最后几股绳索。我以最快的速度沿大船边缘推动我的小船，急于在大船撞上来之前逃开。我刚推完最后一掌，我的手忽然碰到大船上挂下来的一条绳子。</p>
<p>I don't know why I took hold of the rope，but I did．I pulled my boat near to the ship，then stood up to see through the cabin window．I had wondered why the two men weren't on deck，but one look through the window gave me my answer．It was Israel Hands and the man in the red cap，now locked in battle，each with a hand round the other's neck．</p>
<p>我自己也不知道为什么要抓住绳子，但我已经这样做了。我拉住绳子往大船边靠，然后站起来从船舱的窗户往里看。我原来不知道这两个人为什么没在甲板上，不过我只看这一眼就全明白了。伊斯莱尔&middot;汉兹和那个戴红帽的正打作一团，互相扭着对方的脖子。</p>
<p>I dropped down in the boat again，looking over my shoulder at the shore．And there，right behind me，was the pirate's fire on the beach！Then the wind，with sudden violence，turned the Hispaniola，and my little boat with it，and we were both sailing fast into the open sea．</p>
<p>我又跳回到座板上，扭头向岸上望去。就在我身后的海滩上是海盗们的篝火堆。忽然来了一阵大风，大船和小船被一起拉到了宽阔的海面上。</p>
<p>There were sudden shouts and the sound of hurrying feet as the two men ran on deck．I lay down in my boat，sure that when we reached the rough，open water，that would be the end for me．I lay there for many hours，but at last I fell asleep，and in my small，helpless boat，dreamed of home and the Admiral Benbow．</p>
<p>忽然传来喊叫声和两个人在甲板上急匆匆跑过的脚步声。我俯卧在小船里，心想要是风把我们带到险恶的海面上，我就死定了。我这样俯卧了几个小时，慢慢地睡着了，躺在毫无依靠的小船上梦见家和本葆将军酒店。</p>
<p>It was daylight when I woke up．The sun was still hidden be-hind Spyglass Hill，which came down to the sea in dangerous cliffs on this side of the island．It was no place to row ashore，or I would be killed on the rocks．Also，the boat was so small that when I rowed，the waves came over the sides of the boat．I decided to wait until the sea took me somewhere safer on the north side of the island．</p>
<p>我醒来时天已大亮。太阳还被挡在望远镜山后面。这山一直延伸到海里，形成一面峭壁。没有一个好地方可以靠岸，如果贸然靠岸，我就会摔死在岩石上。况且船这么小，我一划，海浪就从船舷涌进来。我决定等着海浪把我带到岛北边较安全的地方再说。</p>
<p>‘I must keep the water out of the boat，’I thought，‘but I can row a little in the smooth places．’</p>
<p>“一定不能让水进来，”我想。“但是在水流平静的地方可以划上几下。”</p>
<p>It was very tiring work，and it kept me busy so that I did not look up and see the Hispaniola until she was just half a mile away from me！But something strange was happening to her．First the ship turned north，then suddenly to the west a-gain．</p>
<p>这是一件很累的工作，我埋头苦干，以至于在伊斯帕尼奥拉号离开我半英里以后我才看到她！但奇怪的事情发生了。那船先是转向北方，然后又忽然向西驶去。</p>
<p>‘She's out of control！’I thought．</p>
<p>“她失去控制了！”我想。</p>
<p>Then the ship turned again，big and dangerous as she came closer and closer to Ben Gunn's little boat．Suddenly，I was on the top of one wave as she came thundering over the next．And there she was，almost upon me！</p>
<p>那船又转了个方向，一点一点向本&middot;葛恩的船靠拢过来，显得又大又危险。忽然当大船俯身越过一个浪尖时，我正处在另一个浪尖上。大船头正好在我的上方。</p>
<p>I jumped up，pushed the boat under the water with my feet，and caught one of the ship's ropes．Then I heard the Hispaniola hit the little boat，and I was left with no way to escape．</p>
<p>我纵身一跳，把小船踩入水中，抓住大船的一根缆绳。然后我听见大船把小船撞沉的声音，我只知道我已无路可逃了。</p><a href='12.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
