<p><b>2 在利力浦特的生活 </b></p>
<p>I was careful to behave as well as possible，to persuade the King to give me my freedom．Lilliputians soon began to lose their fear of me．They called me the Man－Mountain．Sometimes I lay down and let them dance on my hand，and from time to time children came to play games in my hair． By now I was able to speak their language well．</p>
<p>为了说服国王给我自由，我特别小心，尽可能表现得好些。利力浦特人很快就消除了他们对我的畏惧心。他们称我为“人山”，有时我躺下，让他们在我手上跳舞，孩子们偶尔到我的头发里来做游戏。这时候，他们的话我已经能说得很好了。</p>
<p>One day the King invited me to watch the regular entertain－ments，which are greatly enjoyed by him，his family，and his lords and ladies．I was most interested in the rope－dancing． A very thin rope is fixed thirty centimetres above the ground．People who want to become the King's most important officials jump and dance on this rope，and whoever jumps highest with-out falling gets the best job．Sometimes the King orders his lords to dance on the rope，to show that they can still do it．This sport is，of course，rather dangerous，and there are occa－sional deaths as a result．It seems a strange way of choosing of－ficials．</p>
<p>有一天国王邀请我去看定期表演，这是他、他的家人、以及他的王公和贵妇们极为欣赏的。我对他们的绳舞特别感兴趣。一条极细的绳子固定在离地30厘米的位置，想成为国王的重臣的人在绳上跳来跳去、手舞足蹈，跳得最高又不摔下来的人就会获得最好的职位。有时国王也叫王公到绳子上去舞蹈，以表明他们仍然能做。这种运动当然是相当危险的，因此死亡时有发生，这似乎是一种古怪的选拔官员的法子。</p>
<p>There was another interesting entertainment．The King holds a stick in front of him，and sometimes moves it up and down．One by one， people come up to him and jump over the stick or crawl under it．They go on jumping and crawling as the King moves the stick．The winner is the one who jumps and crawls for the longest time，and he receives a blue ribbon to wear round his waist．The second best receives a red ribbon，and the third best gets a green one．Many of the Lil－liput lords wear their ribbons proudly at all times．I had cer－tainly never seen entertainment like this in any of the countries I had visited before．</p>
<p>还有一种有趣的娱乐节目。国王手中拿着根棍子，有时上下移动。人们一个接一个地来到他面前，或者从棍子上跳过去，或者从棍子下爬过去。爬和跳的时间最长的人是胜利者，他将得到一根蓝带子系在腰间。次好的获得一根红带子，第三名得到绿带子。利力浦特许多王公都自豪地系着他们的带子。在以前到过的任何国家我肯定是从来没有见到过这类表演。</p>
<p>Some days later a strange black thing was seen on the beach where I had first arrived in Lilliput．When the people realized it was not alive，they decided that it must belong to the Man- Mountain，and the King ordered them to bring it to me． I thought I knew what it was．When it arrived，it was rather dirty because it had been pulled along the ground by horses．But I was delighted to see that it was in fact my hat．I had lost it in the sea when swimming away from the ship．</p>
<p>一些日子之后，在我最初到达利力浦特的海岸上发现了一个奇怪的黑色东西。当人们发觉那不是活物，他们断定那是人山的，国王命他们给我送来。我想我知道那是什么。由于是用马匹在地面上拖着过来的，东西送到时已经相当脏了。看到那实际上是我的帽子，我很高兴。游离轮船时我把它掉在海里了。</p>
<p>I begged the King so often for my freedom that at last he and his lords agreed that I need not be a prisoner any longer．However，I had to promise certain things：</p>
<p>我经常向国王恳求还我自由，最后他和他的王公们同意我不需要再作囚徒。可是我不得不承诺一些事：</p>
<p>&middot;to help the Lilliputians in war and peace</p>
<p>&middot;在战争与和平中帮助利力浦特人；</p>
<p>&middot;to give two hours’warning before a visit to their capital，so that people could stay indoors</p>
<p>&middot;参观他们的都城要提前两小时通知，以便人们能呆在室内；</p>
<p>&middot;to be careful not to step on any Lilliputians or their animals</p>
<p>&middot;小心不要踩着利力浦特人和他们的牲畜；</p>
<p>&middot;to carry important messages for the King if necessary</p>
<p>&middot;必要时为国王传递重要消息；</p>
<p>&middot;to help the King's workmen carry heavy stones</p>
<p>&middot;帮助国王的工匠搬运重石头；</p>
<p>&middot;to stay in Lilliput until the King allowed me to leave．</p>
<p>&middot;留在利力浦特直到国王允许我离开。</p>
<p>On his side the King promised I would receive food and drink，enough for 1，724 Lilliputians．I agreed to everything at once．My chains were broken，and I was free at last！</p>
<p>在国王方面，他许诺我将得到足够1724个利力浦特人吃的食物和饮料。我立即同意了一切条件。我的锁链被弄断了，我终于获得了自由！</p>
<p>The first thing I did was visit the capital city．The people were warned，so that they would not be in danger．I stepped carefully over the city wall，which was less than a metre high，and walked slowly through the two main streets．It is usually a very busy city，with shops and markets full of people， but to-day the streets were empty．There were crowds watching me from every window．In the middle of the city is the King's palace．The King had invited me to enter it，so I stepped over the surrounding wall into the palace garden．But unfortunately the palace itself has walls a metre and a half high around it．I did not want to damage these walls by trying to climb over them．So I walked carefully back out of the city and into the King's park．Here I cut down several of the largest trees with my knife，and made two wooden boxes．When I returned to the palace with my boxes， I was able to stand on one box on one side of the wall and step on to the other box on the other side．I lay down on the ground and looked through the win－dows，right into the King's rooms．You cannot imagine a more beautiful place to live in．The rooms and furniture are perfect in every detail．As I was looking in， I could see the Queen，surrounded by her lords and ladies．She kindly put her hand ont of the window for me to kiss．</p>
<p>我做的第一件事是参观都城。人们事先接到了通知，因而他们不致有危险。我小心地跨过城墙，那不足一米高，慢慢地走过两条主要大街。这个城市通常非常繁忙，店铺市场挤满了人，不过今天街道却是空的。每个窗口都有一些人在看我。城的中央是王宫。国王曾经邀我进去，因而我跨过围墙进入了御花园。不幸的是，宫殿本身有一米半高的围墙环绕着它。我不想因我的翻墙而把围墙弄坏，所以我小心地往回走出城进入国王的花园。我在那儿用自己的刀子砍倒几棵最大的树，做成两个木盒子。我带着木盒回到王宫，我可以在墙的一边站在木盒上，然后跨到墙的另一边的木盒上。我躺在地上，从窗户望过去，正好看到国王的房间。你再也想不出比这更好的栖身之处了。房间和家具精美入微。我往里看，可以看见王后，周围她的王公和贵妇簇拥着她。她友善地把手伸出窗户让我亲吻。</p>
<p>I think I should give you some general information about Lilliput．Most Lilliputians are about fifteen centimetres tall．The birds and animals are，of course，much smaller than the people，and the tallest trees are only a little taller than I am．</p>
<p>我想我应该给你们讲一些关于利力浦特的大概情况。大多数利力浦特人大约15厘米高。鸟兽当然比人要小不少，而最高的树也只是比我高一点。</p>
<p>All crimes here are punished．But if someone is accused of a crime and then it is proved that the accuser is lying，the accus-er is immediately killed．Lilliputians believe that there are two sides to the law．Criminals must be punished，but people of good character must be rewarded．So if a man can prove that he has obeyed every law for six years，he receives a present of money from the King．They also believe that any man who is honest，truthful，and good can serve his King and country．It is more important to have a good character than to be clever or intelligent．However，only those who believe in God are al- lowed to be the King’ s officials．</p>
<p>这里所有的罪行都要受到惩处。如果有人受到指控而后来证明原告在撒谎，则原告会被立即杀死。利力浦特人相信法律有两面，罪犯必须受到惩处，品行好的人必须受到奖励。因而，如果谁可以证明自己连续六年遵守各项法律，他将得到国王一笔奖励。他们也相信任何人只要诚实、可以信赖、是个好人就能够为国王和国家效力。品行端正比聪明、智慧更重要。但是，只有那些相信上帝的人才能当国王的官员。</p>
<p>Many of their laws and customs are very different from ours，but human nature is the same in every country．The Lil－liputians，like us，have learnt bad ways—choosing officials because they are able to dance on a rope is just one example．</p>
<p>他们的许多法律和习俗都与我们的很不一样，可是人的本性在每一个国家都是一样的。跟我们一样，利力浦特人也学会了一些不好的东西，因为谁能在绳上跳舞就选为官员只是其中一例。</p>
<p>Now I shall return to my adventures in Lilliput．About two weeks after my first visit to the capital，I was visited by one of the King’ s most important officials． His name was Reldresal，and he had helped me many times since I had arrived in Lil－liput．</p>
<p>现在我再回来讲我在利力浦特的经历。大约在我参观都城两周后，国王的一个最重要的官员来访问我。他的名子叫瑞颛沙，自从我来到利力浦特他已经帮了我许多次忙。</p>
<p>I started the conversation．‘I'm so glad they've taken away my chains，’I told him．</p>
<p>我首先开口谈话。“我很高兴他们已经拿掉了我的锁链。”我对他说。</p>
<p>‘Well， my friend，’he answered，‘let me tell you some-thing．You're only free because the King knows we're in a very dangerous situation．’</p>
<p>“嗯，朋友，”他回答说，“让我告诉你，你之所以获释，是因为国王知道我们正处于险境中。”</p>
<p>‘Dangerous？’I cried．‘What do you mean？’</p>
<p>“险境？”我大声问，“这是什么意思？”</p>
<p>‘Lilliput has enemies at home and abroad，’he explained．‘For six years now we've had two political groups，the High－Heels and the Low－Heels．Perhaps the High－Heels were more popular in the past，but as you can see，our present King and all bis officials wear the lowest heels．The two groups hate each other，and a High－Heel will refuse to speak to a Low－Heel．That's the problem in Lilliput．Now， we're getting in－formation that the people of Blefuscu are going to attack us．Have you heard of Blefuscu？It's an island very near us， almost as large and important as Lilliput．They've been at war with us for three years，you see．’</p>
<p>“利力浦特在国内外都有敌人，”他解释说，“我们有两个政治集团，高跟派和低跟派，已经有六年了。高跟派也许过去比较受欢迎，可是你看得出来，现在的国王和所有的官员都穿最低的跟。两个集团相互仇视，高跟派人会拒绝与低跟派人说话。那就是利力浦特的问题。现在，我们得到消息说不来夫斯古的人即将进攻我们。你听说过不来夫斯古没有？那是一个非常靠近我们的岛屿，几乎和利力浦特一样大一样重要。他们和我们已经打了三年的仗。”</p>
<p>‘But how did this war start？’I asked．</p>
<p>“可是仗是怎么打起来的？”我问。</p>
<p>‘Well，you know，of course，that most people used to break their boiled eggs at the larger end． But our King's grandfather once cut a finger while breaking his egg this way，and so his father the King ordered all Lilliputians，from then on， to break the smaller end of their eggs． People who do that are called Small Endians．But Lilliputians feel strongly about this and some Big－Endians have fought angrily against this law．As many as eleven thousand people have been killed because they refused to break their eggs at the smaller end．Some of the Big－Endians have escaped to join our enemies in Blefuscu．The King of Blefuscu has always wanted to defeat Lilliput in war，and now we hear that he's prepared a large number of ships，which will attack us very soon．So you see，my friend，how much our King needs your help，in order to defeat his enemies．’</p>
<p>“哦，你当然知道，大多数人过去习惯于从煮蛋的大的一端打破。而我们国王的祖父有一次这样打蛋时弄伤了手指，所以国王的父王下令所有的利力浦特人从那以后从小的一端打破蛋。那样做的人称作小端派。可是利力浦特人强烈反对这一点，有些大端派人愤怒地反抗这项法令。多达1.1万人因为拒绝从小的一端打蛋而被处死。有些大端派人逃脱加入了我们在不来夫斯古的敌人一边。不来夫斯古的国王早就想在战争中打败利力浦特，而现在我们听说他已经准备了大量的战船，不久就要进攻我们。所以，你看，我的朋友，为了打败他的敌人，我们的国王多么需要你的帮助。”</p>
<p>I did not hesitate for a moment．‘Please tell the King，’I answered warmly，‘that l am ready to give my life to save him or his country．’</p>
<p>我一点也没犹豫。“请转告国王，”我热情地回答，“为了救他和他的国家我宁愿牺牲生命。”</p><a href='3.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
