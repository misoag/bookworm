<p><b>12 到慧骃国的航行 </b></p>
<p>It was not long before I started my next voyage，on 7th September，1710，as captain of my own ship this time．The owner of the ship wanted me to sail to the Indiano Ocean to do some business for him there，but I was very unlucky．On the way，I had to employ some new sailors from Barbados， but they were men of very bad character．I heard them whispering to the other sailors several times，but I did not suspect what they were planning．One morning，as we were sailing round the Cape of Good Hope，they attacked me and tied me up．They told me they were going to take control of the ship and become pirates．There was nothing I could do．They left me，alone，on the beach of a small island in the middle of the Indi－an Ocean．</p>
<p>没过多久我又开始了我的下一次航行，时间1710年9月7日，这次是作为自己轮船的船长。轮船的所有者希望我航行到印度洋在那儿给他做点事，可是我非常不走运。路上，我不得不在巴尔巴道斯雇一些新水手，可是他们都是品行很差的人。我听见他们跟别的水手私语了好几次，但是我没有怀疑到他们在策划阴谋。一天早上，当我们正绕过好望角时，他们袭击了我，把我绑了起来。他们告诉我他们将控制轮船去当海盗。我毫无办法。他们把我孤独地留在印度洋中的一个小岛的沙滩上。</p>
<p>As the ship sailed away，I realized I had no idea where I was．I found a road away from the beach，and walked very quietly and carefully along，in case I was attacked．Several strange-looking animals were lying in a field，and some were sitting in a tree．Their heads and chests were covered in hair，and they had beards as well．They walked sometimes on two，and sometimes on four legs，and could climb trees．They were certainly the ugliest animals I had ever seen in all my travels．</p>
<p>当轮船驶开了，我才想起我不知身在何处。我找到了一条离开沙滩的路，静静地小心地走着，以防受到袭击。几个怪模怪样的动物躺在一块地里，有些坐在树上。他们的头和胸长着毛发，也有胡须。他们有时用两肢着地行走，有时用四肢，他们绝对是我在所有旅行中见到的最丑陋的动物。</p>
<p>When I met one of these creatures on the road，his face showed great surprise and he lifted a foot high in the air．I did not know if he was going to attack me or not，but I hit him hard with the side of my sword．He screamed so loudly that all the other animals ran to help him．There were about forty of them around me．I kept them away by waving my sword in the air，but their wild cries frightened me，and the horrible smell from their bodies made me feel sick．</p>
<p>当我在路上见到一只这种动物时，他脸上露出吃惊的表情，把一只脚高高地举在空中。我不知道他是否要袭击我。但是我用我的剑侧重重地打了他一下。他高声尖叫，其他动物都跑过来帮他。在我周围大约有40个这样的动物。我在空中挥舞着剑，让他们离开我，不过他们狂乱的叫声令我害怕，他们身上的可怕气味令我恶心。</p>
<p>Suddenly they all ran away．I noticed that a horse was com－ing along the road，so I supposed the animals were afraid of him．The horse stopped when he saw me，and seemed very surprised．He neighed several times in a very intelligent，gen－tle way，and I almost wondered if he was speaking in his own language．When another horse came along，the two horses walked up and down together，while neighing to each other．They seemed like two important people discussing a difficult problem．I watched this with astonishment，and decided that if the animals in this country seemed so sensible，the human beings must be the most intelligent in the world．</p>
<p>忽然他们全都跑开了。我看见了一匹马从路上走了过来，所以我估计这些动物害怕他。马看见我时停了下来，似乎很吃惊。他以非常智慧、温柔的方式嘶叫了几下，我几乎在想他是否在用自己的语言说话。另外一匹马来了，两匹马一起走上走下，互相嘶叫。他们像似两个重要的人物在讨论一个难题。我惊讶地看着这一切，觉得如果这个国家的动物看来都这么理智，其人类必定是世界上最智慧的。</p>
<p>The two horses then came close to me，looking at my face and clothes with great interest．They talked to each other a－gain，and then the first horse made clear signs for me to follow him．</p>
<p>然后两匹马走近我，非常感兴趣地看着我的脸和衣服。他们又互相谈话，然后第一匹马作出明显的手势让我跟他走。</p>
<p>He led me to a long，low building．Inside there were several lange airy rooms，with no furniture．Other horses were sitting or lying comfortably on the floor，on clean blankets．But where was the master of the house？Were these horses his ser－vants？I began to wonder if I was going mad．Then I realized that the house did not belong to a human，but to the horse who had brought me here．In this country，horses，not people，were in control．</p>
<p>他把我带到了一个长而低矮的建筑前，里面有几个大而通风的房间，没有家具。其他的马正舒适地站着或躺在地板上、毯子上。可是房子的主人在哪儿？这些马是他的仆从吗？我开始想我是否疯啦。然后我意识到这房子不是属于一个人的，而是属于把我带到这儿来的这匹马，这个国家是由马，而不是人控制着。</p>
<p>I started learning a little of their language．Their word Houyhnhnm means a horse，and the word itself sounds very like the noise a horse makes．I found it very difficult to say this word，and so I decided to shorten it and call them Houys．Their servants were the horrible－looking animals I had seen earlier．They did all the hard work，and lived in dirty！little rooms in another building，where they were tied to the walls．To my horror，these ugly animals，called Yahoos，had human faces which looked very similar to mine．I did not want anyone to think I was a Yahoo，so I tried to make it clear that my habits were very different from theirs．At least I was allowed to sleep in a separate room from them．</p>
<p>我开始学了一点他们的语言。他们的词“慧骃”（“Houyhnhnm”）意思是马，词本身听起来也非常像马叫的声音。我感到非常难发这个词，所以我决定把它缩短叫他们“Houy”。他们的仆从是我先前见到的面目可憎的动物。他们干所有的重活，住在另一个建筑的肮脏小房间里，那儿他们被栓在墙壁上。令我恐怖的是，这些丑陋的动物，叫作耶胡，长着人类的脸，看起来跟我的非常相像。我不想让谁认为我是耶胡，所以我竭力表明我的习惯跟他们的大不一样。至少我被允许睡在一个和他们隔开的房间里。</p>
<p>At first I thought I would die of hunger，as I could not eat the Yahoos’dirty meat or the Houys’grass and corn．But I soon learnt how to bake little cakes made of corn，which I ate with warm milk．Sometimes I caught a bird，an cooked it，or picked leaves of plants to eat with my bread．</p>
<p>起先我以为我会饿死，因为我既不能吃耶胡的脏肉，也不能吃慧骃的草料和谷物。不过我很快就学会了怎样用谷物烤小糕点，我和着热牛奶一起吃。有时我逮住一只鸟烧来吃，或者摘些植物叶来和着我的面包吃。</p>
<p>My Houy master was very interested in me，and as soon as I could speak the language，he asked me to explain where I had come from．</p>
<p>我的慧骃主人对我很感兴趣，一旦我会说他们的话，他就请我解释我是从哪儿来的。</p>
<p>‘Well，master，’I neighed，‘I've come from a country on the other side of the world．And you may not believe this， but in my country all the important people look like Yahoos．’</p>
<p>“好的，主人，”我嘶叫，“我是从在世界的另一边的国家来的。也许你不信，在我的国家所有的重要人物都看起来像耶胡。”</p>
<p>‘But how is that possible？’he asked gently．‘Your Houys surely wouldn't allow unintelligent creatures like Yahoos to control the country．’</p>
<p>“可是那怎么可能呢？”他温柔地问我，“你们慧骃肯定不会允许愚蠢的耶胡来控制国家。”</p>
<p>‘It may seem strange，’I agreed，‘but you see，I was sur－prised to find that in this country the Houys are the sensitive and intelligent creatures．And if I'm lucky enough to return home，I'll tell my friends all about it．But I'm afraid they may accuse me of lying．’</p>
<p>“也许这看起来有点奇怪，”我表示赞同，“可是你看，我发现在这个国家里慧骃是理智而智慧生物也很吃惊。如果我运气好能回到家，我会把这些都告诉我的朋友，不过我担心他们会说我在撒谎。”</p>
<p>My master looked quite worried．‘What is lying？’he asked．</p>
<p>我的主人看得出来相当担心。“什么是撒谎？”他问。</p>
<p>In their language there is no word which means telling lies，and my master had great difficulty in understanding me．I tried to explain．</p>
<p>在他们的语言中没有撒谎一词，我的主人要理解我很困难。我尝试着解释。</p>
<p>‘Oh，’he answered，still unsure．‘But why does anyone tell a lie？There's no reason for doing it．We use language in this country in order to understand each other，and to give and re-ceive information．If you don't tell the truth，how can people understand each other？’</p>
<p>“噢，”他回答，仍然不能肯定，“可是为什么要撒谎呢？没有理由那样做。在这个国家我们用语言来相互理解，发出和接收信息。如果你们不说真相，人们怎么能相互理解呢？”</p>
<p>I began to see how different Houy life was from what I was used to．</p>
<p>我开始明白慧骃的生活跟我过去习惯的是多么不一样。</p>
<p>‘But tell me，’he continued，‘about your country．’</p>
<p>“告诉我，”他接着说，“关于你们国家的情况。”</p>
<p>I was delighted to describe recent English history to him，especially some of our most successful wars．</p>
<p>我很高兴地向他描绘最近的英国历史，特别是一些我们最为成功的战争。</p>
<p>‘But why does one country attack another？’he asked．</p>
<p>“可是为什么一个国家要攻击另一个国家？”他问。</p>
<p>‘There are many reasons，’I replied．‘A king or his lords may want more land．Or there may be a difference of opinion between two countries：for example，whether uniforms should be black，white，red or grey．Sometimes we fight because the enemy's too strong，sometimes because he isn't strong enough ．Sometimes our neighbours want the things we have，or have the things we want，so we both fight until they take ours or give us theirs．We often attack our best friend，if we want some of his land．There's always a war somewhere．For this reason，being a soldier is one of the best jobs you can have．’</p>
<p>“有许多理由。”我回答，“一个国王或119者他的王公想得到更多的土地，或者两个国家意见有分歧，比如说，制服该是黑色、白色、红色还是灰色。有时候我们打仗是因为敌人太强大，有时候是因为他不够强大。有时候我们的邻居想要我们有的东西，或者是有我们想要的东西，所以我们打仗，直到他们拿走我们的，或者把他们的给我们。我们经常攻击我们最好的朋友，如果我们想要他的一些领土。某个地方总会有战争。因此，当个战士是你能得到的最好工作之一。”</p>
<p>‘A soldier，’repeated my master．‘I'm not quite sure what that is．’</p>
<p>“战士？”我的主人重复道，“我不太清楚那是什么。”</p>
<p>‘A soldier is a Yahoo who works for his King and country．His orders are to kill as many people as he can，’I answered．</p>
<p>“战士是为他的国王和国家工作的耶胡。给他的命令是尽量杀人。”我回答。</p>
<p>‘People who've never hurt him？’asked the Houy．</p>
<p>“杀害从来没有伤害他的人”？慧骃问。</p>
<p>‘That's right，’I said，pleased that he seemed to under－stand at last．‘Soldiers have killed thousands of people in re－cent history．’</p>
<p>“对。”我说，高兴地看到他似乎终于理解了，“在最近的历史上战士已经杀死了成千上万的人。”</p>
<p>He shook his head and looked sad．‘I think you must be-what was your word？Ah yes—lying to me．How could you and your countrymen kill so many other Yahoos？And why would you want to？’</p>
<p>他摇着头，看上去很哀伤。“我想你一定在——你们的词怎么说的？噢，对——向我撒谎。你和你的国人怎么能杀死那么多耶胡呢？而你们又为什么想那样呢？”</p>
<p>I smiled as I replied proudly，‘Sir，you don't know much about European war．With our guns and bullets and gunpow－der we can destroy a thousand ships，a hundred cities，and twenty thousand men You see，—’</p>
<p>我笑着骄傲地回答，“先生，你不太了解欧洲的战争。用我们的枪、子弹和火药我们可以摧毁 1000只轮船，100座城池，2万人。你看——”</p>
<p>‘Be quiet！’he ordered．‘I 've heard enough．I know Ya-hoos are bad，but I didn't realize they could possibly do such terrible things．’</p>
<p>“安静点！”他命令道，“我听够了。我知道耶胡坏，可是我也没想到他们竟然会作出如此可怕的事。”</p>
<p>After these conversations I began to wonder whether the Houys were right．Why do we humans so often fight wars and tell lies？Peace and truth began to seem more important than making war or making money．I became more and more used to the Houys’ideas and way of life．As the Houys did，I hated the Yahoos for their dirty habits and unpleasant character．By the time I had been there a year，I walked and neighed like the Houys．I felt such a strong love for them that I planned to spend the rest of my life among them，and to try to become more like them．It is a great sadness to me，even today，that this was not possible．</p>
<p>经过这些谈话后，我开始想慧骃是否是对的。为什么我们人类如此经常地进行战争和撒谎？和平和真话开始看起来比进行战争或挣钱更重要。我越来越习惯于慧骃的想法和生活方式。和慧骃一样，我也厌恶耶胡的脏习惯和令人不快的性格。到这时我已经在那儿一年了，我像慧骃那样走路和嘶叫。我对他们充满强烈的喜爱，我计划我的余生都和他们一起度过，并且变得更像他们。这没成为可能；即使今天也是我的一大憾事。</p>
<p>One day my Houy master said，‘Can you explain something to me？Why are the Yahoos so violently fond of those shining stones in the fields？They dig for days to get them out of the ground，and hide them jealously from other Yahoos．’</p>
<p>一天我的慧骃主人说，“你可以给我解释一些事吗？为什么耶胡如此狂热地喜欢田野里的那些闪亮的石头？他们连续多少天把它们从地里挖出来，小心翼翼地把它们藏起来不让别的耶胡发现。”</p>
<p>‘I expect they've found pieces of gold or silver，’I said．Because he did not seem to understand，I added，‘We use them as money，to pay for things，you see．’</p>
<p>“我估计他们找到了金子或银子。”我说，因为他似乎还不理解，我又加了一句，“我们用来当钱花，来买东西，明白吧。”</p>
<p>‘How strange！’he replied．‘We share everything here．No Houy needs－what do you call it？-money．’</p>
<p>“多奇怪！”他回答，“我们这儿什么都共享，没有慧骃需要——你们叫它什么？——钱。”</p>
<p>Perhaps you can imagine how I felt．I knew I could be hap－py for ever with these sensible，gentle creatures，who never lied or stole，in a country which had no disease，no crime，no wars．But this perfect happiness did not last long．</p>
<p>也许你可以想象我的感受，我清楚，和这些理智、温顺的动物在一起，他们从不撒谎或偷盗，在一个没有疾并没有犯罪、没有战争的国家里，我将永远幸福。可是这种完美的幸福没有持续多长时间。</p>
<p>‘I'm sorry，’said my master one day．‘My friends and I have decided you can't stay here any longer．You see，you're neither one of us，nor a Yahoo．’</p>
<p>“我很抱歉，”一天我的主人说，“我的朋友和我已经决定，你不能在这儿呆下去了。你看，你既不是我们中的一员，也不是一个耶胡。”</p>
<p>‘No！’I cried desperately．‘Don't send me away！How can I go back to England to live with those awful Yahoos！’</p>
<p>“不！”我绝望地叫，“不要赶走我！我怎么能回到英国去与那些可怕的耶胡住在一起呢！”</p>
<p>‘I'm afraid you must，’he replied gently．‘My servants will help you make a boat．’</p>
<p>“我恐怕你必须走。”他温文尔雅地回答，“我的仆从会帮你造一只船。”</p>
<p>And so，two months later，although I was very sad to leave，I said goodbye to my dear master and his family，and rowed away from the land of the Houys．I knew that I would never find happiness anywhere else．</p>
<p>这样，两个月后，尽管我为离去感到悲伤，我还是告别了我的主人和他的一家，划船离开了慧骃国。我清楚我在别的地方再也不会找到幸福。</p>
<p>After several days travelling eastwards，I arrived in Aus－tralia，and from there managed to find a ship returning to Eu-rope．I did not enjoy the voyage．The sailors all laughed at me because I walked and neighed like a horse．They looked just like those horrible Yahoos，and at first I could not let them touch me or come near me．Their ugly faces and unpleasant smell made me feel quite ill．</p>
<p>向东航行了几天后，我到达了澳大利亚，在那儿我找到了一艘返回欧洲的轮船。我不喜欢这旅行。水手们都嘲笑我，因为我像一匹马那样走路和嘶叫。他们就像那些可怕的耶胡，起初我不让他们碰我或者靠近我。他们丑陋的脸和令人不快的气味让我感到恶心。</p>
<p>And when I arrived home in England，after being away for five years，my wife and children were delighted to see me，be-cause they had thought I was dead．But to my horror they looked and smelt like Yahoos too，and I told them to keep away from me．</p>
<p>当我到达了在英格兰的家，在离开了5年后，我的妻子和儿女见到我非常高兴，因为他们以为我已经死了。令我感到恐惧的是，他们看起来、嗅起来也像耶胡，我叫他们离我远点。</p>
<p>Even now，five years later，I do not let my children get close to me，although I sometimes allow my wife to sit with me while I eat．I try to accept my countrymen now，but the proud ones，who are so full of their own self-importance-well，they had better not come near me．How sad that people cannot learn from the Houys！I was hoping that perhaps hu- man beings would change their ways after reading the stories of my life with the Houys．But they accuse me of lying in my book．And now I realize that people still lie，steal，and fight，just as they have always done，and probably will always do．</p>
<p>即使现在，5年以后，我还是不让我的孩子靠近我，尽管我有时让我的妻子在我吃饭时与我在一起坐一会儿。现在我力图接受我的国人，那些骄傲的除外，他们充满了自大的情绪——他们最好不要走近我。人们不能向慧骃学习是多么令人忧伤！我希望人类在读了我与慧骃在一起生活的故事后也许会改变他们的方式。可是他们指责我在书中撒谎。现在我意识到人们仍然在撒谎、抢劫和战争，正如他们一直所做的，而且也许永远会这样。</p>
<p>I will say no more．Clearly，there is no hope for human be-ings．I was stupid to think that I could bring reason and truth into their lives and thoughts Humans are all Yahoos，and Ya- boos they will remain．</p>
<p>我不想再说什么。显然，人类是没有希望的。我真愚蠢，我以为我可以把理智和真相带到他们的生活和思想中去。人类都是耶胡，而且将永远是耶胡。</p></body></html>
