<p><b>11 格勒大锥和拉格奈格 </b></p>
<p>Although the Laputans were kind to me，I did not want to spend a long time in their country．Therefore，I de-cided to travel from Balnibarbi to the island of Luggnagg，from there to Japan，and then home to England．But before I went to Luggnagg，an official I had met in Lagado persuaded me to visit the small island of Glubbdubdrib．</p>
<p>尽管勒皮他人对我很和善，我并不想在这个国家呆多长时间，所以我决定从巴尔尼巴比旅行到拉格奈格岛，从那儿到日本，然后回到英国。可是在我去拉格奈格以前我在拉格多见到的一个官员说服我去参观格勒大锥小岛。</p>
<p>‘You'll find it a very interesting place，he told me．‘Glubbdubdrib means the island of magicians．All the impor－tant people there are good at magic，you see．The President is the best magician of them all．But I must warn you，he has some very strange servants-they're all ghosts！By using magic he can order the ghost of any dead person to be his ser－vant for twenty-four hours，and the ghost must obey．’</p>
<p>“你会发现那是一个非常有意思的地方。”他告诉我，“格勒大锥的意思是魔术师之岛，那儿所有的重要人物都擅长魔术，你明白吧。总统是他们中间最好的魔术师，但是我得警告你，他有一些非常奇怪的仆人——他们是鬼魂！他可以用魔法命令任何一个死去的人的鬼魂给他当24小时的仆人，而且鬼魂必须服从。”</p>
<p>It seemed unbelievable，but it was true．When we arrived on the island，we were invited to the President's palace．His servants certainly looked strange to me there was a smell of death about them．When the President no longer needed them，he waved a hand，and they simply disappeared．</p>
<p>这似乎难以置信，却是真的。我们到达岛上，被邀请到总统的宫里去。他的仆人在我看来绝对很古怪——他们有种死人的气味。当总统不再需要他们时，他一挥手他们就简单地不见了。</p>
<p>I visited the President every day during my stay，and soon got used to seeing the ghosts．One day the President said，‘Gulliver，would you like to call a ghost？It could be anyone from the beginning of the world up to the present day．You could ask them questions about their lives．And you can be sure they'll tell the truth— ghosts always do．</p>
<p>我在逗留期间天天去拜访总统，不久就习惯了看鬼魂。有一天总统说，“格列佛，你想不想叫一个鬼魂来？可以从世界开始那一时刻起直到现在的任何一个。你可以问他们关于他们一生的问题。而且你可以肯定他们会告诉实情——鬼魂总是这样的。”</p>
<p>‘That's very kind of you，sir，I replied，and thought hard for a moment．‘First，I’d like to see Alexander the Great，please．’</p>
<p>“非常感谢你，先生。”我回答说，费力地考虑了一会，“首先，我想见亚历山大大帝，拜托。”</p>
<p>The President pointed out of the window．There in a large field was the ghost of Alexander，with his huge army．This famous king lived long ago in Macedonia in northern Greece．His kingdom covered many countries，from Greece to Egypt，from Persia to parts of India．But he died very young，when he was only thirty－three，and no one knew why．The Presi－dent called him into the room．</p>
<p>总统向窗外一指，那儿，在一个大的战场上出现了亚历山大大帝的鬼魂，以及他庞大的军队。这个伟大的国王很久以前生活在北希腊的马其顿。他的王国包括许多国家，从希腊到埃及，从波斯到印度的部分地区，但是他很年轻就死了，只活了33岁，谁也不知道为什么。总统叫他进屋来。</p>
<p>‘Great King，’I said to him，‘just tell me one thing．Were you murdered，or did you die naturally！’</p>
<p>“伟大的国王，”我对他说，“只告诉我一件事，你是被谋杀的还是自然死亡？”</p>
<p>‘Young man，’he replied，‘nobody murdered me．I drank too much and died of a fever．’</p>
<p>“年轻人，”他回答说，“没有人谋杀我，我喝得太多，死于热玻”</p>
<p>So，in these few words，I had learnt one of the secrets of history！I turned to the President．‘And now，may we see Julius Caesar and Brutus？’</p>
<p>这样，就这几句话，我得知了历史上的一大秘密！我转向总统，“现在，我们可以见尤里乌斯&middot;凯撒和布鲁图吗？”</p>
<p>The two Romans took Alexander's place．Brutus，of course，had killed Julius Caesar in Rome on 15th March，44BC—one of the most famous murders in history．It is terrible to die by the hand of a friend．</p>
<p>这两个罗马人站到了亚历山大的地方。当然，布鲁图于公元前44年3月15日在罗马杀死了尤里乌斯&middot;凯撒——历史上最为有名的谋杀之一。死于朋友之手太可怕了。</p>
<p>‘Great Caesar，’I said，‘how do you feel about your mur-derer，Brutus？’</p>
<p>“伟大的凯撒，”我说，“你对你的谋杀者布鲁图怎么看？”</p>
<p>‘Do not call him that，’replied Caesar，‘He is a brave，good man，the best in Rome，and he did the right thing for Rome by killing me．In death，as in life，he has always been my friend．’</p>
<p>“不要那样叫他，”凯撒回答，“他是一个勇敢的好人，罗马最优秀的人，他杀死我为罗马做了一件正确的事。身后和生前一样，他永远是我的朋友。”</p>
<p>I cannot remember how many more ghosts I called to appear．I was very interested in their answers to my questions，which often seemed to offer a different view of his-tory from the one I had been taught at school．</p>
<p>我不记得我还叫了多少鬼魂现身，我对他们对我问题的回答非常感兴趣，这些回答似乎提供了一种对历史的看法，经常与学校所教的毫不相同。</p>
<p>However，it was soon time to leave Glubbdubdrib，and sail to Luggnagg，a much larger island to the south－east of Japan．The Luggnuggians are polite and generous people，and I stayed here for three months．I made many friends among them．One day，one of them asked me，‘Have you ever seen any of our Struldbrugs？’</p>
<p>但是很快就到了该离开格勒大锥、驶向拉格奈格的时间，一个在日本东南、大得多的岛屿。拉格奈格人是有礼貌而慷慨大方的人民，我在那儿呆了3个月。我交了许多朋友。一天，有一个朋友问我，“你见过了我们的斯特鲁布鲁格没有？”</p>
<p>‘I don't think so，’I replied．‘What's that？’</p>
<p>“我想没有。”我回答说，“那是什么？”</p>
<p>‘Well，a Struldbrug is a human being who will never die，but will live for ever．If a Luggnuggian baby is born with a round spot above its left eye，which never disappears，it's a Struldbrug．We have over a thousand of them in the country．’</p>
<p>“噢，斯特鲁布鲁格是长生不死的人，如果一个拉格奈格婴儿生下来时左眼上有一个圆点，而且圆点是永不消失的，那么这个婴儿就是个斯特鲁布鲁格。我们国家有1000多个这样的人。”</p>
<p>‘How wonderful！’I cried．‘How exciting！How lucky you are in Luggnagg，where a child has a chance of living for ever！And how especially lucky the Struldbrugs are！Disease，disas－ter，and death can never touch them！And imagine how much we can learn from them！I expect they're among the most im－portant people in the country．They've lived through history and know so much，which they're certain to pass on to the rest of us．If I had the chance，I’d like to spend my whole life listening to the intelligent conversation of these extraordinary people，here in Luggnagg！’</p>
<p>“多么美妙啊！”我叫道，“多么令人兴奋！你们在拉格奈格多么幸运，孩子有机会永生！这些斯特鲁布鲁格是多么特别的运气呀！疾并灾难和死亡不能奈何他们！你想想我们可以从他们那儿学到多少东西！我想他们是这个国家最重要的人。他们活了这么多年，知道多少的东西，他们肯定要传播给其余的人。如果我有机会，我愿意整个一生都来听这些不同寻常的人的睿智的谈话，就在拉格奈格！”</p>
<p>‘Well，of course，’answered my Luggnuggian friend with a smue，‘we'll be delighted if you stay longer with us．But I’d like to know how川you would plan卯your life if you were a Struldbrug．’</p>
<p>“噢，当然，”我的拉格奈格朋友笑着回答，“我们将很高兴如果你和我们呆久一点。不过我想知道如果你是个斯特鲁布鲁格的话，你将怎样安排你的生活。”</p>
<p>‘That's easy，’I replied．‘First I’d work hard，and earn a lot of money．In about two hundred years I’d be the richest man in Luggnagg．I’d study too，so that I knew more about everything than the cleverest professors．I’d also write down everything important that happened over the years，so that students of history would come to me for help．I’d teach young people what I had learnt．But most of my time I’d spend with other Struldbrugs，friends of mine．Together we could help to destroy crime in the world，and begin to build a new and bet－ter life for everyone．’</p>
<p>“那很容易。”我回答，“首先我将努力工作，挣许多钱。用近200年的时间我将成为拉格奈格最富有的人。我也将学习，这样我比最聪明的教授知道的都还多。我也会记下这些年里发生的每一件重大的事情，这样历史学者也会向我求助。我要教年轻人我所学到的。不过大多数时间我将与其他斯特鲁布鲁格，我的朋友，一起度过，我们一起可以帮助消灭世界上的犯罪，开始为每一个人建立新的更好的生活。”</p>
<p>I had only just finished describing the happiness of endless life，when I realized that my friend's shoulders were shaking and tears of laughter were running down his face．</p>
<p>我刚刚描绘完无尽生活的幸福，才发现我的朋友的肩膀抖动、笑得泪水都流到了脸上。</p>
<p>‘I really must explain，’he said．‘You see，you've made a very understandable mistake．You suppose that if someone lives for ever，he is young，healthy，and strong for ever too．And that doesn't happen．Our Struldbrugs have a terrible life．After living for about eighty years，they become ill and miser－able．They have no friends and they can't remember much of the past．At that age the law considers them to be dead， so their children inherit their houses and money．Then they sometimes have to beg to get enough food to eat．They lose their teeth and hair，they forget the names of their families，and the only thing they want is to die．But that's impossible！’</p>
<p>“我必须说明，”我朋友说，“你看，你犯了一个可以理解的错误。你以为如果一个人永远活着，他也永远年轻、健康而且强壮。可是那并没有发生。我们的斯特鲁布鲁格生活很可怕。在活了大约80年后，他们变得多病而悲惨。他们没有朋友，也记不住过去。在这个岁数法律认定他们已经死了，所以他们的孩子继承了他们的房屋和钱财。这样他们有时候不得不乞讨以搞到足够的东西吃。他们掉了牙齿和头发，他们忘记了他们家族的名字，他们唯一想要的就是死去。但是那不可能！”</p>
<p>I realized how stupid I had been，and felt very sorry for the poor Struldbrugs．</p>
<p>我明白了我是多么愚蠢，为可怜的斯特鲁布鲁格感到难过。</p>
<p>I finally left Luggnagg on a boat sailing to Japan．From there I found a ship which was returning to England．My voy－age to Laputa，Balnibarbi，Glubbdubdrib and Luggnagg had taken me away from home for five and a half years．</p>
<p>最后我乘了一只驶往日本的船离开了拉格奈格。我在那儿找到了一艘正要回英国的船。我到勒皮他、巴尔尼巴比、格勒大锥和拉格奈格的航行使我离开家已经五年半了。</p><a href='12.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
