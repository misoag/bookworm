<p><b>2 巴黎的一家酒店 </b></p>
<p>In the part of Paris called Saint Antoine everyone was poor. The streets were narrow and dirty, the food－shops were almost empty. The faces of the children looked old already, because they were so hungry. In the wine－shop of Monsieur Defarge there were not many customers and Defarge was outside, talking to a man in the street. His wife, Madame Defarge, sat inside the shop, knitting and watching. Defarge came in and his wife looked at him, then turned her eyes to look at two new customers, a man of about sixty and a young lady. Defarge went over to speak to them, suddenly kissed the young lady's hand, and led them out of the back of the shop. They followed him upstairs, many stairs, until they reached the top. Defarge took a key out of his pocket.</p>
<p>在巴黎的一个名叫圣安东尼的地方，所有的人都很穷。街道狭窄肮脏，食品店几乎都是空的。孩子们的脸已显出老态，因为他们太饥饿了。在得法热先生的酒店里没有多少顾客，得法热则在门外与街上的一个男人交谈着。他的妻子得法热夫人正坐在店里一边织毛衣一边观察着周围。得法热走进店来，他的妻子看着他，然后就把眼光转过去盯着两位新来的顾客，他们是一位大约60岁的男人和一位年轻的女士。得法热走过去同他们说话，他突然吻起了那位小姐的手，接着领着他们从店铺后面走出去。他们跟着他上楼，爬了很多级楼梯才到达楼顶。得法热从兜里掏出一把钥匙来。</p>
<p>'Why is the door locked?' asked Mr Lorry in surprise.'He is a free man now.'</p>
<p>“为什么锁着门?”劳里先生惊讶地问。“他现在是个自由人了。”</p>
<p>'Because he has lived too long behind a locked door, ' replied Defarge angrily.'He is afraid if the door is not locked！That is one of the things they have done to him.'</p>
<p>“因为他在上了锁的房子里生活的时间太长了，”得法热气愤地回答说。“门要是不锁上他就会害怕！这是他们给他造成的恶果之一。”</p>
<p>'I'm afraid, too, ' whispered Miss Manette. Her blue eyes looked worriedly at Mr Lorry.'I am afraid of him—of my father.'</p>
<p>“我也害怕，”马内特小姐低声地说。她那蓝蓝的眼睛忧心地看着劳里先生。“我害怕他——我的父亲。”</p>
<p>Defarge made a lot of noise as he opened the door. Mr Lorry and Lucie went into the room behind him. A thin, white－haired man was sitting on a wooden seat. He was very busy, making shoes.</p>
<p>得法热开门时弄出了很多响声，劳里先生和路茜跟在他后面进了屋子。一个瘦削而头发全白的人正坐在一个木头凳子上。他在忙着做鞋子。</p>
<p>'Good day, ' said Defarge.'You are still working hard, I see.'</p>
<p>“您好，”得法热说。“您还在忙着哪?”</p>
<p>After a while they heard a whisper.'Yes, I am still working.'</p>
<p>过了一会儿他们才听到一声嘟哝：“是的，我还在干着活。”</p>
<p>'Come, ' said Defarge.'You have a visitor. Tell him your name.'</p>
<p>“瞧，”得法热说。“有人来看您了。告诉他们您的名字。”</p>
<p>'My name?' came the whisper.'One Hundred and Five, North Tower.'</p>
<p>“我的名字?”嘟哝声传过来道。“一百零五，北塔。”</p>
<p>Mr Lorry moved closer to the old man.'Dr Manette, don't you remember me, Jarvis Lorry?' he asked gently.</p>
<p>劳里先生走近了老人。“马内特医生，您不记得我了吗，贾维斯&middot;劳里?”他轻声地问道。</p>
<p>The old prisoner looked up at Mr Lorry, but there was no surprise, no understanding in his tired face, and he went back to work making shoes.</p>
<p>这个老犯人抬起头看着劳里先生，但是没有表现出惊奇，疲惫的脸上没有显示出他明白了什么的表情，然后他又重新做起鞋来。</p>
<p>Slowly Lucie came near to the old man. After a while he noticed her.</p>
<p>路茜慢慢地走近了老人。过了片刻他才注意到了她。</p>
<p>'Who are you?' he asked.</p>
<p>“你是谁?”他问道。</p>
<p>Lucie put her arms around the old man and held him, tears of happiness and sadness running down her face. From a little bag the old man took some golden hair. He looked at it, and then he looked at Lucie's hair.'It is the same. How can it be?' He stared into Lucie's face.'No, no, you are too young, too young.'</p>
<p>路茜伸出胳膊抱住了老人并搂紧他，悲喜交加的泪水滚下了脸颊。老人从一个小包里拿出几缕金发。他看看它们，然后又看看路茜的头发。“是一样的，这怎么可能呢?”他凝视着路茜的睑。“不，不，你太年轻了，太年轻了。”</p>
<p>Through her tears Lucie tried to explain that she was the daughter he had never seen. The old man still did not understand, but he seemed to like the sound of Lucie's voice and the touch of her warm young hand on his.</p>
<p>路茜含着泪竭力地要说明她是他从未曾见过的女儿。老人仍旧不明白，但却似乎很喜欢路茜的声音以及她年轻温暖的手触摸他的手。</p>
<p>Then Lucie said to Mr Lorry, 'I think we should leave Paris at once. Can you arrange it?'</p>
<p>后来路茜对劳里先生说：“我看我们得马上离开巴黎。您能安排一下吗?”</p>
<p>'Yes, of course, ' said Mr Lorry.'But do you think he is able to travel?'</p>
<p>“是的，当然能，”劳里先生说。“但你认为他能够旅行吗?”</p>
<p>'He will be better far away from this city where he has lost so much of his life, ' said Lucie.</p>
<p>“远离这个让他失去生命中如此之多的城市，他就会好些的。”路茜说道。</p>
<p>'You are right, ' said Defarge.'And there are many other reasons why Dr Manette should leave France now.'</p>
<p>“你说得对，”得法热说。“况且让马内特医生马上离开法国还有很多其他的原因。”</p>
<p>While Mr Lorry and Defarge went to arrange for a coach to take them out of Paris, Lucie sat with her father. Exhausted by the meeting, he fell asleep on the floor, and his daughter watched him quietly and patiently until it was time to go.</p>
<p>在劳里先生和得法热去安排载他们出巴黎的马车时，路茜陪坐在她父亲的身旁。他被这次相会弄得疲倦极了，便在地板上睡着了，他的女儿则安静而耐心地看顾着他，直到该走的时候。</p>
<p>When Mr Lorry returned, he and Defarge brought food and clothes for Dr Manette. The Doctor did everything they told him to do；he had been used to obeying orders for so many years. As he came down the stairs, Mr Lorry heard him say again and again, 'One Hundred and Five, North Tower.'</p>
<p>劳里先生回来时，他和得法热给马内特医生带回来些食物和衣服。医生完全照着他们的要求行事，这么多年来他已经习惯了服从命令。在他下楼时，劳里先生听见他一遍又一遍地说着“105，北塔。”</p>
<p>When they went to the coach, only one person saw them go：Madame Defarge. She stood in the doorway, and knitted and watched, seeing everything… and seeing nothing.</p>
<p>在他们朝马车走去时，只有一个人看到了他们，那就是得法热夫人。她站在门口，边织着毛衣边观察着。她看到了所有的事情……但没有发现任何的问题。</p><a href='3.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
