<p><b>9 间碟 </b></p>
<p>While this was happening, Miss Pross was out shopping for the family. Jerry Cruncher was with her, and they had just gone into a wine－shop when Miss Pross suddenly stopped, looked at one of the customers, and cried out in a loud voice,</p>
<p>发生这件事的时候，普罗斯小姐正出去为全家采购东西去了。杰里&middot;克拉彻和她在一起，他们刚好进了一家酒店。普罗斯小姐突然站住，看着一位顾客大声喊道：</p>
<p>'Oh Solomon, dear Solomon！I've found you at last, dear brother！But whatever are you doing here in Paris? '</p>
<p>怎么会在巴黎呢? ”</p>
<p>'Don't call me Solomon. You'll get me killed. Pay for your wine, and come outside, 'said the man in a low, frightened voice.</p>
<p>“别叫我所罗门，你会让我丧命的。把酒钱付了，然后出来。”那个男人因害怕而低声地说道。</p>
<p>They went outside. 'You mustn't recognize me here, 'said the man. 'It's not safe. Go your way, and let me go mine. '</p>
<p>他们来到了外面。“你在这儿千万不要同我相认，”那个男人说。“这不安全。你走你的路，我也走我的路。”</p>
<p>Miss Pross began to cry at these unbrotherly words, and Jerry Cruncher stepped forward to stare in the man's face.</p>
<p>面对这毫无姐弟之情的话，普罗斯小姐哭了起来。杰里&middot;克拉彻走上前来盯着这个男人的脸。</p>
<p>'Wait a minute, 'said Jerry. 'Is your name John Solomon, or Solomon John? Your sister calls you Solomon. I know that your name's John；I remember that. But your other name wasn't Pross at that Old Bailey trial. What was your name then? '</p>
<p>“等一等，”杰里说，“你是叫约翰&middot;所罗门，还是叫所罗门&middot;约翰? 你姐姐叫你所罗门，我知道你的名字是约翰。我还记得这一点。但你在旧巴勒的审判会上只有名宇，不是普罗斯，你那时叫什么来着? ”</p>
<p>'Barsad！'said another voice.</p>
<p>“巴萨德！”另一个声音说道。</p>
<p>'Yes, Barsad, that's it, 'cried Jerry. He turned round and saw Sydney Carton standing behind him.</p>
<p>“是的，巴萨德，就是这个。”杰里喊道。他转过身去看见西得尼&middot;卡登正站在他身后。</p>
<p>'Don't be alarmed, my dear Miss Pross, 'said Carton, smiling at her. 'But I'm afraid I have to tell you that your brother is a spy, a spy for the French prisons. '</p>
<p>“别惊慌，亲爱的普罗斯小姐，”卡登对她微笑着说。“只是我得告诉你你弟弟是个间谍，是为法国监狱工作的间谍。”</p>
<p>Solomon Pross, also Barsad, went pale. 'That's not true！'</p>
<p>所罗门&middot;普罗斯，也就是巴萨德的脸变得苍白。“那不是真的！”</p>
<p>'I saw you come out of the Conciergerie today. I followed you, 'said Carton, 'and I found out what you do. And I've decided that you may be able to help me. Come with me to the office of Mr Lorry. '</p>
<p>“我今天看见你从贡赛杰里①那儿出来。我跟踪你来着，”卡登说。“而且我发现了你是干什么的，我肯定你或许能帮我。跟我去劳里先生的办公室吧。”</p>
<p>After a short argument, which Carton won, Barsad followed him to Mr Lorry's office.</p>
<p>经过短暂的争执，卡登先生胜了，巴萨德便跟着他到了劳里先生的办公室。</p>
<p>'I boring bad news, Carton said to Mr Lorry. 'Darnay has been arrested again. '</p>
<p>“我带来了一个坏消息”卡登对劳里先生说。“代尔那又被抓起来了。”</p>
<p>'But I was with him only two hours ago, 'cried Mr Lorry.</p>
<p>“可两小时前我还和他在一起的。”劳里先生嚷道。</p>
<p>'He was safe and free！'</p>
<p>“他当时既安全又自由。”</p>
<p>'Even so, he has been arrested and taken to the Conciergerie. And I'm not sure that Dr Manette's good name can save him this time. So we must have Mr Barsad's help. '</p>
<p>“尽管这样，他还是已经被抓了起来并被带到了贡赛杰里。我也不知道这次马内特医生的好名声是否能救他。所以我必须得到巴萨德先生的帮助。”</p>
<p>'I will not help you, 'said Solomon Pross, called John Barsad.</p>
<p>“我不会帮你们的。”所罗门&middot;普罗斯，即所谓的约翰&middot;巴萨德说。</p>
<p>'Oh, I think you will, 'said Sydney Carton, 'when you hear what I could say about you. Let's think. Mr Barsad is a spy, and a prison guard, but he used to be a spy in England. Is he still paid by the English? '</p>
<p>“哦，我想你会的。”西得尼&middot;卡登说。“当你听我说了关于你的事后。让我们想一想，巴萨德先生是个间谍，也是一个监狱看守，但他在英国曾做过间谍。他现在是否还被英国人雇佣呢? ”</p>
<p>'No one will listen to you, 'said Barsad.</p>
<p>“没人会听你的。”巴萨德说。</p>
<p>'But I can say more, Mr Barsad, 'replied Carton.</p>
<p>“但我还可以说更多的东西，巴萨德先生。”卡登回答。</p>
<p>Barsad had more problems than Carton knew. He could not return to England because he was wanted by the police there. And in France, before he became a prison guard for the citizens'revolution, he had been a spy for the King's officers. He knew that Madame Defarge, that terrible woman, had knitted his name into her list of enemies of the people. Most of those on her list had already been killed by the Guillotine, and Barsad did not want to be next.</p>
<p>巴萨德的麻烦事比卡登知道的还多。他之所以回不了英国是因为他被那里的警察所追捕，而且在法国，在他成为公民们的监狱看守之前，他曾为国王的官员们做过间谍。他知道得法热夫人，那个可怕的女人，已把他的名字织进了人民敌人的名单上了。她名单上的大多数人都已经死在了断头台上，而他可不想成为下一个。</p>
<p>'You seem worried, Mr Barsad, 'said Carton calmly.</p>
<p>“你似乎很担心，巴萨德先生。”卡登镇静地说。</p>
<p>The spy turned to Mr Lorry. 'Miss Pross is my sister, sir. Would you send her brother to his death, sir? '</p>
<p>间谍转向劳里先生说道：“普罗斯小姐是我的姐姐，先生。您难道会送她弟弟去死吗，先生? ”</p>
<p>'The best thing for your sister, Mr Barsad, 'said Carton smoothly, 'is not to have a brother like you. I think I will inform the Tribunal that I suspect you of spying for England. You will be condemned at once, I am sure. '</p>
<p>“对你姐姐来说最好的事情，巴萨德先生，”卡登平静地说，“就是没有了像你这样的弟弟。我想我得告知审判团，就说我怀疑你是英国的间谍。我相信你会被马上处决的。”</p>
<p>'All right, 'Barsad said slowly, 'I'll help you. But don't ask me to do anything that will put my life in danger, because I won't do it. '</p>
<p>“好吧。”巴萨德慢慢地说道，“我会帮助你们，可是别想让我做任何有生命危险的事，因为我不会做的。”</p>
<p>'You're a guard at the Conciergerie prison, where Darnay is, aren't you? 'said Carton. 'Come, let us talk privately in the next room. '</p>
<p>“你是贡赛杰里监狱的看守，代尔那就在那里，是不是? ”卡登说。“来，让我们在旁边的屋子里私下谈谈。”</p>
<p>When Mr Carton returned alone, Mr Lorry asked what he hsd done.</p>
<p>当卡登先生一个人回来时，劳里先生问他都干了些什么。</p>
<p>'Not much, 'replied Carton, 'but if it goes badly for Darnay tomorrow, I can visit him once. It's all I could do. '</p>
<p>“没干什么，”卡登回答，“只是如果明天代尔那的处境不妙的话，我就能再去看他一次。这就是我所能做的一切了。”</p>
<p>'But that will not save him, 'cried Mr Lorry sadly.</p>
<p>“但是那也救不了他。”劳里先生伤心地哭道。</p>
<p>'I never said it would. '</p>
<p>“我从来没说那能救他。”</p>
<p>Mr Lorry was an old man now, with a life of hard work behind him. Tears filled his eyes as he realized he could do nothing to help Lucie and her father now.</p>
<p>劳里先生现已年迈，他一生工作勤勤恳恳，当他意识到他现在无论如何也帮不了路茜和她父亲时，眼中溢满了泪水。</p>
<p>Sydney Carton felt very sorry for Mr Lorry. 'You're a good friend of Dr Manette and his daughter, but don't tell them about me or this meeting. It can't help Lucie. 'He paused. 'Will you go back to London soon? '</p>
<p>西得尼&middot;卡登为劳里先生感到很难过。“您是马内特医生和他女儿的好朋友，但是别告诉他们有关我或这次会面的事。那帮不了路茜。”他停了停，说道：“你不久就要回伦敦吗? ”</p>
<p>'Yes, my work for Tellson's Bank here is finished. I have the necessary papers to leave Paris. I was ready to go tomorrow. '</p>
<p>“是的，我在这儿的台尔森银行的工作已经结束了，我有离开巴黎所必须的证件，我准备明天就动身。”</p>
<p>'Then don't change your plans, 'said Carton, very seriously.</p>
<p>“那么别改变计划。”卡登非常严肃地说。</p>
<p>Later that night Sydney Carton visited a shop in a quiet corner of Paris. He wrote on a piece of paper the names of several powders and gave it to the shopkeeper.</p>
<p>那天晚上西得尼&middot;卡登去了巴黎的一个寂静角落处的商店。他在一张纸上写下了几个药粉的名字并把它给了店主。</p>
<p>'For you, citizen? 'asked the shopkeeper.</p>
<p>“是你用吗，公民? ”店主问。</p>
<p>'Yes, for me. '</p>
<p>“是的，是我用。”</p>
<p>'You must be careful, citizen Keep these things separate. You know what happens if you put them together. '</p>
<p>“你得小心，公民。把这些东西分开着放。你清楚如果把它们放在一起会发生什么事情的。”</p>
<p>'Perfectly, 'replied Carton.</p>
<p>“非常清楚。”卡登说道。</p>
<p>He spent the rest of that night walking the streets of Paris. He watched the moon rise in the sky, he listened to the sounds of the River Seine flowing through the heart of the city, and he thought calmly about the past, and the future. He thought about all the deaths that the city had already seen…and he thought about Lucie's gentle, loving face and her sad, sad eyes.</p>
<p>那天晚上剩下的时间他都用于漫步巴黎的街道。他看见月亮升起在天空中，听见塞纳河流经这个城市中心时的声响，他平静地想到了过去，还有未来。他想到了这个城市所经历过的死亡……他也想到了路茜那温柔、可爱的脸庞以及她悲伤、忧郁的眼睛。</p><a href='10.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
