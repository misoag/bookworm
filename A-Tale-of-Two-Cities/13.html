<p><b>13 最后的道别 </b></p>
<p>At that same hour in the early afternoon a coach going out of Paris drives up to the gates of the city.</p>
<p>在那天午后不久的同一时刻，一辆出巴黎的马车正驶向城门。</p>
<p>'Who goes there? Show us your papers！'The guard looks at the papers. 'Alexandre Manette, Doctor. Which is he? '</p>
<p>“谁在那儿? 请出示你们的证件！”卫兵看着证件说：“亚历山大&middot;马内特医生。哪个是他? ”</p>
<p>This is Dr Manette；this helpless old man, whispering crazily to himself.</p>
<p>这是马内特医生，这个无助的老人，正发疯地对自己嘀咕着。</p>
<p>'The last few days of the Revolution have been too much for him, 'said the guard with a cruel laugh. 'Lucie his daughter. The wife of Evr&eacute;monde. Which is she? '</p>
<p>“最近几天的革命让他受不了啦。”卫兵残忍地大笑着说。“路茜是他的女儿，埃弗蒙的妻子。哪个是她? ”</p>
<p>This is she. With her child, little Lucie, beside her.</p>
<p>这就是她，还有她的孩子，小路茜在她身边。</p>
<p>'Hah, your husband has another meeting today. Sydney Carton. Lawyer, English. Which is he? '</p>
<p>“哈，你丈夫今天可有另外一个聚会哟。西得尼&middot;卡登律师，英国人。哪一位是他? ”</p>
<p>He is here, in the corner. He is not well.</p>
<p>他在这儿，在角落里。他身体不舒服。</p>
<p>'And Jarvis Lorry. Banker, English. Which is he? '</p>
<p>“还有贾维斯&middot;劳里，银行家，英国人。是哪一位? ”</p>
<p>'I am he, and the last, 'says Jarvis Lorry.</p>
<p>“我就是，也是最后一位。”贾维斯&middot;劳里说。</p>
<p>'Here are your papers, Jarvis Lorry. You may go. '</p>
<p>“这是你们的证件，贾维斯&middot;劳里，你们可以走了。”</p>
<p>There are wildly beating hearts in the coach, and trembling hands；there is the heavy breathing of the unconscious traveller. But onwards the coach goes；the horses are fast, and there are no shouts behind them on the road.</p>
<p>车里的人的心都狂跳着，手也在发抖，还有那个失去知觉的旅行者发出的沉重的呼吸声，但马车在前进，马匹跑得飞快，在他们身后的路上没有喊叫声。</p>
<p>Also that afternoon Madame Defarge was talking with her friends.</p>
<p>也就在那天下午，得法热夫人正在和她的朋友谈话。</p>
<p>'My husband is a good citizen, but he is not strong enough. He feels sorry for the Doctor. I say that all the Evr&eacute;monde people must go to the Guillotine. The wife and the child must follow the husband. '</p>
<p>“我的丈夫是个好公民，可他不够坚定。他可怜医生。我说要让埃弗蒙家的所有人都上断头台，妻子和孩子都得跟那个丈夫一起去。”</p>
<p>'They're both fine heads for the Guillotine, 'said Jacques Three. 'Their heads will be a pretty sight when they are shown to the people. Yes, they too, must die. '</p>
<p>“她们俩的头可是断头台上的好货色，”雅克三说。“把她们的头展示给人民将会是一个漂亮的景观。是的，她们也都得死。”</p>
<p>'But I'm afraid that my husband may warn them and let them escape, 'Madame Defarge went on, 'and I must do something myself. After the death of Evr&eacute;monde at three this afternoon we'll go to the Tribunal and accuse them. '</p>
<p>“可我担心我丈夫会报警给她们让她们跑掉。”得法热夫人说，“所以我必须亲自做点什么。在今天下午3点钟埃弗蒙死后，我要去审判团指控她们。”</p>
<p>The others agreed willingly. 'No one must escape. More heads must fall. '</p>
<p>其他人都欣然同意。“不许有任何人跑掉；必须有更多的人头落地。”</p>
<p>'Lucie Manette will be at home now, waiting for the moment of her husband's death, 'said Madame Defarge. ' I will go to her. She will say things against the Revolution, and condemn herself. Here, take my knitting and keep my usual seat near the Guillotine. '</p>
<p>“路茜&middot;马内特现在应该正在家里等着她丈夫死的那一刻。”得法热夫人说。“我要去找她，她会说一些反对革命的话，因而招来罪名。好了，拿着我的毛线活儿，把断头台旁边我一向待的位子留着。”</p>
<p>'Don't be late, 'said her friend.</p>
<p>“别晚了。”她的朋友说。</p>
<p>'To see the death of Evr&eacute;monde, I shall not be late, 'replid the cruel voice of Madame Defarge.</p>
<p>“去看埃弗蒙的死，我不会晚的。”得法热夫人用冷酷的声音回答道。</p>
<p>There were many women in Paris at that time who hated the nobles and wanted to see them die. But of all these women, Madame Defarge was the one most feared. All her life she had been filled with hate. It was nothing to her that an innocent man was going to die because of his father's and his uncle's crimes. She wanted more. Hidden in her clothes were a gun and a sharp knife, and with her usual confident step, she began to walk to Dr Manette's house.</p>
<p>那时的巴黎有很多妇女痛恨贵族并希望看到他们死。但在所有这些妇女中，得法热夫人是最可怕的一个。她的生命中充满了仇恨。一个无辜的男人正要因为他父亲或他叔叔的罪孽而死，这对她来说算不了什么。她所要的比这更多。她在衣服里藏了一支枪和一把尖刀，便迈着她一贯自信的步伐，开始朝马内特医生的住处走去。</p>
<p>The house was not yet empty. Miss Pross and Jerry Cruncher were there, preparing to follow Mr Lorry's coach. Mr Lorry had decided that two coaches were better than one；with fewer passengers, each coach would travel faster. But Miss Pross was still worried. A second coach leaving from the house might suggest an escape.</p>
<p>房子里的人尚未走空。普罗斯小姐和杰里&middot;克拉彻还在里面，正准备着跟上劳里先生的马车。劳里先生已断定两辆马车比一辆要好。乘客少些马车可以走得更快些。可普罗斯小姐仍旧很担心，因为第二辆马车离开这座房子也许会显示出逃跑的迹象。</p>
<p>'Mr Cruncher, 'she said, 'you must go and stop our coach coming here. Drive to the church instead, and I'll meet you there at three o'clock. '</p>
<p>“克拉彻先生，”她说，“你得去拦一下我们的马车别让它到这儿来，而是改去教堂。我会在3点钟时和你会合。”</p>
<p>Jerry hurried away. It was twenty past two, and at once Miss Pross began to get herself ready to leave. She was washing her face when she suddenly looked up and saw a figure standing in the room.</p>
<p>杰里赶紧走了。那是两点20分，普罗斯小姐立刻开始为离开而做准备。在她洗脸时，她突然抬头看到一个人正站在房间里。</p>
<p>Madame Defarge looked at her coldly. 'The wife of Evr&eacute;monde；where is she? '</p>
<p>得法热夫人冷冷地看着她。“埃弗蒙的妻子，她在哪儿? ”</p>
<p>Miss Pross quickly stood in front of the door to Lucie's room. 'You're a cruel, dangerous woman, but you won't frighten me, 'she said, breathing hard.</p>
<p>普罗斯小姐迅速站到了路茜的房门前。“你是一个残忍、危险的女人，可是你吓唬不了我。”她呼吸艰难地说。</p>
<p>Each woman spoke in her own language, and neither understood the other's words. But Madame Defarge knew that Miss Pross was a true friend of the Doctor's family, and Miss Pross knew that Madame Defarge was the family's enemy.</p>
<p>两个女人各自说着自己的语言，彼此都听不懂对方的话。而得法热夫人知道普罗斯小姐是医生家的一个真正的朋友；而普罗斯小姐知道得法热夫人是这个家的敌人。</p>
<p>'I wish to see the wife of Evr&eacute;monde. Go and tell her. Do you hear me? 'said Madame Defarge. She stared angrily at Miss Pross, but Miss Pross stared back just as angrily.</p>
<p>“我要见埃弗蒙的妻子，去告诉她，你听到了吗? ”得法热夫人说道。她愤怒地盯着普罗斯小姐，而普罗斯小姐也同样愤怒地盯着她。</p>
<p>'I am desperate, 'said Miss Pross. 'I know that the longer I can keep you here, the greater hope there is for my darling girl. If you fight me, I'll fight back！'</p>
<p>“我豁出去了，”普罗斯小姐说。“我知道我在这儿把你拖得越久，我亲爱的姑娘的希望就越大。如果你打我，我也会反击你的。”</p>
<p>Madame Defarge stepped forward and called loudly, 'Citizen Doctor！Wife of Evr&eacute;monde！Answer me！'</p>
<p>得法热夫人走上前去大喊起来：“医生公民！埃弗蒙的妻子！回我的话！”</p>
<p>There was no answer and Madame Defarge quickly opened three of the doors and saw that the rooms were empty. One door was still closed.</p>
<p>得法热夫人没听到答话便迅速打开了其中的三扇房门，看到房间是空的。有一扇门还关着。</p>
<p>'If they are not in that room, they are gone. But they can be followed and brought back. 'She went towards the door, but Miss Pross jumped forward and held her round the waist. Madame Defarge was used to the fighting in the streets and was strong, but love is stronger than hate and Miss Pross did not let go. Madame Defarge tried to pull out her knife.</p>
<p>“如果他们不在那间房里，那么就是已经走了。可他们会被追上并给抓回来的。”她向那扇门走去，可普罗斯小姐冲上前去抱住了她的腰。得法热夫人已经习惯了在街上打架而且她很壮实，但爱比恨的力量更强大，普罗斯小姐没有松手。得法热夫人企图拔出刀来。</p>
<p>'No, 'said Miss Pross, 'it's under my arm. You shall not have it. '</p>
<p>“不。”普罗斯小姐说。“刀在我胳膊底下，你是拿不到的。”</p>
<p>Madame Defarge put her hand to the front of her dress and began to pull out the gun. Miss Pross looked down, saw what it was, and hit out at it wildly. There was a loud bang, and a cloud of smoke, and Miss Pross stood alone, trembling with terror.</p>
<p>得法热夫人把手伸到裙子前面开始拔枪。普罗斯小姐朝下一看，弄清了那是什么东西，就猛烈地朝外打它。一声巨响，接着又是一团烟。之后，普罗斯小姐便独自站在了那儿，恐惧地颤抖着。</p>
<p>All this in a second. As the smoke cleared, Miss Pross saw the lifeless body of Madame Defarge on the ground. In horror, she opened her mouth to call for help, but then she thought of the dangers this would bring for her dear Lucie. With shaking hands, she got her hat and coat, locked the door of the room, and went downstairs. As she crossed the bridge on the way to the church, she dropped the key of the locked room in the river and hurried on to meet Jerry Cruncher.</p>
<p>这一切都发生在一秒钟内。烟雾消散之后，普罗斯小姐看见得法热夫人断了气的身体躺在地板上。由于恐惧，她张嘴喊着救命，但她又想到这会给她亲爱的路茜带来危险。她颤抖着双手，拿上帽子和外衣，锁上房门便下了楼。在去教堂的桥上，她把锁房门的钥匙扔到了河里便匆匆赶去见杰里&middot;克拉彻。</p>

<p>* * *</p>
<p>As the death－carts carry the condemned prisoners through the streets of Paris, crowds watch to see the faces of those who are to die. In the chairs around the Guillotine, the friends of Madame Defarge are waiting for her. 'Teresa, Teresa Defarge！Who has seen her? She's never missed before！'</p>
<p>当死囚车载着死刑犯们穿过巴黎的街道时，人们集中注意力看那些临死的人们的脸。得法热夫人的朋友们正坐在断头台周围的椅子上等着她。“特丽莎，特丽莎&middot;得法热！谁见到她了? 她以前从来没错过的！”</p>
<p>But the death－carts have arrived, and the Guillotine has already begun its work. Crash！—A head is held up, and the women who sit knitting count One.</p>
<p>可是死囚车已经到了，断头台已开始工作了。咔嚓！——一个人头被举了起来，坐在那儿编毛线活的女人们数着“一个。”</p>
<p>The supposed Evr&eacute;mode helps the young girl down from the cart. He carefully places her with her back to the Guillotine, and she looks up gratefully into his face.</p>
<p>那个被当做了埃弗蒙的人帮着那个小女孩下了囚车。他小心地让她背对着断头台，她感激地抬头望着他的脸。</p>
<p>Because of you, dear stranger, I am calm. I think you were sent to me by God, 'she whispers.</p>
<p>“因为您，亲爱的陌生人，我才这样平静。我想你是上帝送给我的。”她小声说道。</p>
<p>'Or perhaps He sent you to me, 'says Sydney Carton. 'Keep your eyes on me, dear child, and do not think of anything else. '</p>
<p>“或许是上帝把你送给我的。”西得尼&middot;卡登说。“眼睛看着我，亲爱的孩子，别的什么事都不要想。”</p>
<p>'I do not mind while I hold your hand. I shall not mind when I let it go, if they are quick. '</p>
<p>“我拉着你手的时候就不害怕了，松开手后我也不害怕，如果他们能快点的话。”</p>
<p>'They are quick. Fear not！'</p>
<p>“他们很快。别怕。”</p>
<p>She kisses his lips；he kisses hers. Now the Guillotine is waiting. The young girl goes next, before him. The women count Twenty－Two, and Carton walks forward.</p>
<p>她吻了他的嘴唇；他也吻了她的。断头台现在正在等着，下一个就是年轻的女孩子，在他之前。女人们数着二十二，接着卡登走上前去。</p>
<p>Twenty-Three.</p>
<p>二十三。</p>
<p>They said of him that it was the most peaceful face ever seen there What passed through Sydney Carton's mind as he walked those last steps to his death? Perhaps he saw into the future…</p>
<p>人们谈论他说他的脸是在那种地方见过的最平静的脸。当西得尼&middot;卡登迈着最后的步伐向死亡走去时，他的脑海中想到了什么呢? 也许他看到了未来……</p>
<p>'I see Barsad, Defarge, the judges, all dying under this terrible machine. I see a beautiful city being built in this terrible place. I see that new people will live here, in real freedom. I see the lives for whom I give my life, happy and peaceful in that England which I shall never see again. I see Lucie when she is old, crying for me on this day every year, and I know that she and her husband remember me until their deaths. I see their son, who has my name, now a man. I see him become a famous lawyer and make my name famous by his work. I hear him tell his son my story.</p>
<p>“我看见巴萨德、得法热、法官们都在这个可怕的机器下面死去。我看到一个美丽的城市正在这片可怕的土地上建立起来。我看到新一代的人民将在真正的自由中生活。我看到我为之付出生命的人们，他们幸福安宁地生活在我再也见不到的英国。我看见路茜年老的时候，每一年的这一天都会为我哭泣，我知道她和她的丈夫会一直到死都记着我。我看见他们的儿子，有着和我一样的名字，现在长成了一个男人。我看见他成了一位著名的律师并通过他的工作而使我扬名四方。我听见他给他的儿子讲起我的故事。”</p>
<p>'It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done；it is a far, far better rest that I go to, than I have ever known. '</p>
<p>“我做的是一件很好的事。它远远好过我所做的所有的事。它将是一个很好的长眠，远比我所知道的要好。”</p></body></html>
