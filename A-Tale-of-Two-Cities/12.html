<p>Charles Darnay passed his last night alone in the prison.</p>
<p>查尔斯&middot;代尔那独自一人在监狱里过着他最后的一个夜晚。</p>
<p>He had no hope. He knew he must die, not for anything he had done wrong, but for the crimes of his father and his uncle. He sat down to write to his wife：</p>
<p>他不抱什么希望了。他知道他必须得死，不是因为他做错了什么事，而是因为他父亲和叔叔所犯下的罪行。他坐下来给他的妻子写信：</p>
<p>I knew nothing about the time your father spent in prison until he told me. Even then I did not know that it was my family that had been so cruel to him. I told your father that my real name was Evr&eacute;monde, and he made me promise not to tell you. I am sure that he had forgotten the paper he had written, but what has happened now is not his fault. Take care of him and our child, and one day we shall all meet again in the happier world that comes after death.</p>
<p>在你父亲告诉我以前，我对他在监狱中度过的岁月一无所知。即便那时我也不知道是我的家庭曾那样残忍地对待过他。我当时告诉你父亲我的真实姓氏是埃弗蒙，但他让我发誓不要告诉你。我相信他那时已经忘了他曾在监狱里写的那份记录。但是现在发生的事不是他的过错。你要好好照顾他和我们的孩子。会有一天我们将重逢在一个更幸福的世界里的，人们死后就会到来的那个世界。</p>
<p>Darnay did not sleep peacefully that night and in the morning he walked up and down his prison, waiting. He counted the hours—nine, gone for ever, ten, eleven, twelve gone for ever. At one o'clock he heard someone outside the door. The door opened and closed and there stood Sydney Carton, holding a warning finger to his lips.</p>
<p>代尔那那天晚上没有安睡过，凌晨他在囚室里走来走去地等待着。他数着时间——9点，永远过去了，10点、11点、12点，都永远消逝了。一点钟时他听见有人在门外。门开了又关上。西得尼&middot;卡登走了进来。他伸出一只手指按在嘴上告诉他别出声。</p>
<p>'Be quiet！I come from your wife. She begs you to do exactly what I say, and to ask no questions. There is no time. Take off your boots and put on mine. '</p>
<p>“我从你妻子那儿来；她求你完全按照我说的去做。什么也别问，没时间了。脱掉你的靴子换上我的。”</p>
<p>'Carton, my dear friend, 'said Darnay, 'it is impossible to escape from this place. You will only die with me. '</p>
<p>“卡登，我亲爱的朋友，”代尔那说道，“从这个地方逃跑是不可能的，你只会和我一起去死的。”</p>
<p>'I'm not asking you to escape. Put on my shirt, and my coat. 'He did not allow Darnay time to argue or refuse. 'Now sit down and write what I say, 'he said. 'Quickly, my friend, quickly！'</p>
<p>“我没让你逃跑。穿上我的衬衫。还有我的大衣。”他没有给代尔那争辩或拒绝的时间。“现在坐下写下我说的话。”他说。“快点儿，我的朋友，快一点儿。”</p>
<p>'If you remember, 'he said, and Darnay wrote, 'the words we spoke so long ago, you will understand this when you see it. 'As he said this, Carton took his hand from his pocket.</p>
<p>“如果你还记得，”他说着，代尔那写着。“我们很久以前说过的话，那么在你看到它时就会明白这一点了。”当他说着这些话时，卡登从兜儿里伸出手来。</p>
<p>'What is that in your hand? 'asked Darnay.</p>
<p>“你手里是什么东西? ”代尔那问。</p>
<p>'Nothing. Have you written“see it”? Good, now go on writing, 'said Carton quietly. 'I am happy that I can prove them now. This is not a reason for sadness. 'Carton's hand was close to Darnay's face, and he gently pressed a cloth against Darnay's nose and mouth. A minute later Darnay lay unconscious on the ground. Carton quickly dressed himself in Darnay's clothes, and pushed the note that Darnay had written inside Darnay's pocket. Then he went to the door and called softly, 'Come in now. '</p>
<p>“没什么。你写完'看到它'了吗? 好的，现在接着写。”卡登平静地说。“我很高兴现在能够验证那些话了。没有理由伤心。”卡登的手靠近了代尔那的脸并轻轻地把一块布按在了代尔那的鼻子和嘴上。一分钟过后，代尔那便失去了知觉，躺在了地上。卡登迅速穿上了代尔那的衣服，并把代尔那刚写的纸条塞进了代尔那的口袋里，然后他走到门边轻声喊道：“现在进来吧。”</p>
<p>The spy Barsad came in.</p>
<p>那个间谍巴萨德走了进来。</p>
<p>'Quick, help me, 'said Carton. 'You must help me to the coach. '</p>
<p>“快，帮帮我。”卡登说。“你必须帮助我上马车。”</p>
<p>'You? 'asked the spy.</p>
<p>“你? ”间谍问。</p>
<p>'Him, man, I've changed places with him. You can say that it was too much for him, saying his last goodbye to his friend. That happens quite often, I believe. '</p>
<p>“他，伙计。我已经和他换了位置。你可以声言说他承受不住和他的朋友诀别。这样的事经常发生，我相信。”</p>
<p>'Yes, often, 'replied Barsad. 'But do you promise to keep me out of danger, and go on with this plan to the end? The number must be right. Fifty－two prisoners must die today. '</p>
<p>“是的，经常发生。”巴萨德答道。“但你许诺过不让我有危险，并把计划坚持到底的呀? 数字必须是对的，今天必须死52名囚犯的。”</p>
<p>'Have I not already promised to be true to the death? Hurry, man！Take him to Mr Lorry, put him in the coach yourself, and tell Mr Lorry to leave at once！'</p>
<p>“我难道还没保证要真的去死吗? 快点，伙计！带他去劳里先生那儿，你自己把他抬到马车里去，告诉他们马上就走。”</p>
<p>Barsad called two men into the room, and told them to lift the unconscious man and carry him out.</p>
<p>巴萨德叫了两个人进了牢房；并让他们把那个失去知觉的人抬起来扛出去。</p>
<p>'The time is short, Evr&eacute;monde, 'said Barsad, in a warning voice.</p>
<p>“时间不多了，埃弗蒙。”巴萨德以警告的语气说。</p>
<p>'I know it well, 'replied Carton. 'Be careful with my friend, and leave me. '</p>
<p>“我很清楚。”卡登回答说。“小心照顾我的朋友，留我一个人在这儿好了。”</p>
<p>The door closed and Carton was left alone. He listened care－fully but there were only normal prison sounds. No shouts, no alarm bells. He waited calmly.</p>
<p>门关上了，卡登独自留了下来。他仔细地听着，只有正常的监狱里的声响。没有喊叫，没有警铃。他平静地等待着。</p>
<p>Soon he heard the sound of doors opening. The door of his prison cell opened and a man said, 'Follow me, Evr&eacute;monde！'and Carton followed him into a large, dark room.</p>
<p>不久他听到了开门的声音。他的囚室的门开了，一个人说道：“跟我走，埃弗蒙！”于是卡登便跟着他来到一个大而暗的房间里。</p>
<p>There were many people there, some standing, some sitting, some walking about, some crying. Most of them stood, silent, looking at the ground. A young woman came up to him；she was thin and pale.</p>
<p>那里面有很多人，有站着的，有坐着的，有来来回回走着的，有哭喊着的。他们大多数都默默地站着，看着地面。一个年轻女子向他走来，她又瘦又苍白。</p>
<p>'Citizen, Evr&eacute;monde, 'she said. ' I was with you in La Force. '</p>
<p>“埃弗蒙公民，”她说。“我曾在拉弗尔斯和你在一起待过。”</p>
<p>'True, 'he said softly, 'but I forget what you were accused of. '</p>
<p>“是的，”他柔声说，“只是我忘了你是为什么被指控的。”</p>
<p>'I am innocent. What could a poor little thing like me do? I am not afraid to die, Citizen Evr&eacute;monde, but I have done nothing.</p>
<p>“我是无辜的。像我这么个可怜的小人物能干什么呢? 我不怕死，埃弗蒙公民，只是我什么也没有做。”</p>
<p>Her sad smile as she said this touched Carton's heart.</p>
<p>她说这话时悲伤的笑容触动了卡登的心。</p>
<p>'They say that the Revolution will do so much good for the poor people, 'said the girl. 'How can my death help the poor? If it is true, I am willing to die, but I do not know how that can be. I heard that you were set free, Citizen Evr&eacute;monde, 'she went on. 'I hoped it was true. '</p>
<p>“他们说革命会给穷人们带来很多好处。”女孩说道。“我的死能帮穷人什么忙呢? 如果能，那么我乐意去死。但我不明白这怎么可能呢? 我曾听说你被释放了的，埃弗蒙公民。”她接着说。“我当时希望这是真的。”</p>
<p>'It was, but I was taken again, and condemned. '</p>
<p>“是真的，但又被抓起来了，而且宣判了死刑。”</p>
<p>'When we go from here, Citizen Evr&eacute;monde, will you let me hold your hand? I am not afraid but I am little and weak, and it will help to make me brave. 'The young girl looked into his face and he saw a sudden doubt come into her eyes, followed by surprise. He touched his lips with his finger.</p>
<p>“在我们从这儿走时，埃弗蒙公民，你能让我抓住你的手吗? 我不怕死，可是我又小又弱，所以那样会让我勇敢起来的。”年轻的姑娘看着他的脸，于是他发现她眼中忽然露出一丝怀疑，跟着便是惊讶。他用手指碰了碰嘴唇。</p>
<p>'Are you dying for him? 'she whispered.</p>
<p>“你为他去死吗? ”她低声问。</p>
<p>'And his wife and child. Yes. '</p>
<p>“还有他的妻子和孩子。是的。”</p>
<p>'Oh, will you let me hold your brave hand, stranger? '</p>
<p>(缺)</p>
<p>'Yes, my poor sister, to the last. '</p>
<p>“是的，我可怜的小妹妹，直到最后。”</p><a href='13.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
