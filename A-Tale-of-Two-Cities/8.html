<p><b>8 在公民们的手里 </b></p>
<p>Tellson's Bank in Paris was in a large building south of the river, close to the heart of the city. Mr Lorry had arrived in Paris some days before Charles Darnay, and was now living in some rooms above the bank. One evening, looking out of the window, he saw that a large grindstone had been brought into the square below. There was a wild, shouting crowd around it, busy sharpening their knives and swords and axes, which were already red with blood. With shaking hands, Mr Lorry closed the window.</p>
<p>巴黎的台尔森银行在河南岸的一个大楼里，接近市中心。劳里先生已先于查尔斯&middot;代尔那几天到达巴黎，现在正住在银行楼上的几间房里。一天傍晚，他朝窗外看时，见到一块巨大的磨石被人扛到了楼下的场地上。一群疯狂、呼叫着的人正围着它。他们忙着磨刀、剑和斧子，这些利刃已经被血染红了。劳里先生颤抖着双手关上了窗户。</p>
<p>He had decided to go downstairs and talk to the bank guards, when suddenly the door of his room opened, and Lucie and her father ran in.</p>
<p>他本来决定下楼去和银行卫兵谈谈的，却见房门被突然打开，路茜和他父亲跑了进来。</p>
<p>'Lucie！Manette！What has happened? Why are you here? ' cried Mr Lorry.</p>
<p>“路茜！马内特！发生了什么事? 你们怎么来了? ”劳里先生喊道。</p>
<p>'Charles is in Paris, 'cried Lucie. 'He came to help an old family servant. But he's been taken to prison. '</p>
<p>“查尔斯现在在巴黎，”路茜嚷道。“他来这儿是要营救一位老仆人的，可他现在已被关进了监狱。”</p>
<p>At that moment the shouts of the crowd outside grew louder.</p>
<p>这时候外面人群的喊声更大了。</p>
<p>'What is that noise? 'asked the Doctor.</p>
<p>“那些声音是怎么回事? ”医生问。</p>
<p>'Don't look out！'cried Mr Lorry.</p>
<p>“别往外看！”劳里先生大声说。</p>
<p>'My friend, 'said the Doctor. 'I am safe in Paris. I was a prisoner in the Bastille. Every body knows about me and how I suffered. Already people want to help me；they gave us news of Charles. '</p>
<p>“我的朋友，”医生说。“在巴黎我是安全的。我曾是巴士底狱的一个囚徒，所有的人都知道我以及我是怎么受苦的。人们愿意帮助我，他们给了我们有关查尔斯的消息。”</p>
<p>'Even so, don't look outside. Where is Charles? '</p>
<p>“即便这样，也别往外看。查尔斯在哪儿? ”</p>
<p>'In the prison of La Force. '</p>
<p>“在拉弗尔斯监狱。”</p>
<p>'La Force！Dear Lucie, you can do nothing tonight. You must go to one of the rooms here and wait. I must told with your father at once. '</p>
<p>“拉弗尔斯监狱！亲爱的路茜，你今天晚上是无能为力的了，你得待在这儿的一间房子里等着，我必须马上和你父亲谈谈。”</p>
<p>Lucie kissed him and left the room.</p>
<p>路茜吻了他后便离开了房间。</p>
<p>'Quick, Manette, 'said Mr Lorry. 'These people outside, with their bloody knives, are murdering the prisoners. If you are so well known, if you have this power, talk to them. Tell them who you are, and go to La Force. Quick, before it is too late！'</p>
<p>“快，马内特，”劳里先生说。“外面的这些人正拿着血淋淋的刀子要去杀囚犯。如果你这么有名气，如果你有这个力量，就去和他们谈谈，告诉他们你是谁，然后去拉弗尔斯。快，趁现在还不晚！”</p>
<p>Dr Manette hurried outside. Mr Lorry watched from the window as the Doctor talked to the crowd. He heard shouts of 'Long live the Bastille prisoner！Help his friend in La Force！'</p>
<p>马内特医生赶紧出去了。劳里先生从窗户看见医生对着人群讲话。他听到人们高喊“巴士底狱的囚犯万岁！要帮助他在拉弗尔斯里的朋友！”</p>
<p>Mr Lorry went to Lucie and found her with her daughter and Miss Pross. Together they waited all night for news, but none came.</p>
<p>劳里先生去见路茜，发现她和她的女儿及普罗丝小姐在一起。他们在一起等了整整一夜的消息，可是什么也没有等到。</p>
<p>In the morning Mr Lorry found rooms for Lucie and her family in a quiet street near the bank. He left Jerry Cruncher with them as a guard, and returned worriedly to Tellson's. At the end of the day a strong, serious man came to see him.</p>
<p>早上劳里先生在银行附近一条安静的大街上为路茜和她的家人找到了房子。他留下杰里&middot;克拉彻做保卫，然后焦急地回到了台尔森银行。白天快要过去时，来了一位强壮而严肃的人要见他。</p>
<p>'My name is Defarge. I come from Dr Manette；he gave me this. 'Defarge gave him a piece of paper.</p>
<p>“我叫得法热，我从马内特医生那儿来，他给了我这个。”得法热给他一张纸条。</p>
<p>The Doctor had written, Charles is safe, but I cannot leave this place yet. Take Defarge to Lucie.</p>
<p>医生写的是：查尔斯安全，但我还不能离开这儿。带得法热见路茜。</p>
<p>'Come with me, 'said Mr Lorry happily. They went downstairs and at the front door found Madame Defarge, knitting. Without a word, she joined them, and Mr Lorry led them to Lucie's rooms.</p>
<p>“跟我来，”劳里先生高兴地说。他们下了楼并在前门见到了得法热夫人，正在织着毛线活儿。她没说什么便跟上他们。劳里先生便领他们来到路茜的房间。</p>
<p>There, Defarge gave Lucie a note from her husband.</p>
<p>得法热在这儿给了路茜一张她丈夫写的纸条。</p>
<p>Dearest—be brave. I am well, and your father has some power here. You cannot answer this, but kiss our child for me.</p>
<p>“亲爱的——勇敢些。我很好，你父亲在这儿有一些影响。你不能回信，但要替我亲亲我们的孩子。”</p>
<p>Only a short letter, but it meant so much to Lucie. Gratefully, she kissed the hands of Defarge and his wife. Madame Defarge said nothing；her hand was cold and heavy, and Lucie felt frightened of her.</p>
<p>只是一封短信，但对路茜来说则意味着太多的东西。路茜感激地吻了得法热和他妻子的手。得法热夫人什么话也没说，她的手冰冷而沉重，路茜对她感到害怕。</p>
<p>Miss Pross came in with little Lucie.</p>
<p>普罗丝小姐和小路茜一起走了进来。</p>
<p>'Is that his child? 'asked Madame Defarge, stopping her knitting to stare.</p>
<p>“那是他的孩子吗? ”得法热夫人问，同时停下了编织的活儿，拿眼盯着小路茜。</p>
<p>'Yes, Madame, 'said Mr Lorry. 'That is our poor prisoner's little daughter. '</p>
<p>“是的，夫人，”劳里先生说，“那是我们可怜的囚犯的小女儿。”</p>
<p>'It is enough, my husband, 'said Madame Defarge. 'We can go now. 'Her voice was as cold as her hand.</p>
<p>“这就够了，我的丈夫，”得法热夫人说。“我们现在可以走了。”她的声音像她的手一样冰冷。</p>
<p>'You will be good to my husband? 'asked Lucie, afraid. 'I beg you, as a wife and mother. '</p>
<p>“您会善待我的丈夫吗? ”路茜害怕地问，“我恳求您，以一个妻子和母亲的名义。”</p>
<p>'We have known many wives and mothers, 'said Madame Defarge. 'And we have seen many husbands and fathers put in prison, for many years. What is one more, among so many? '</p>
<p>“我们知道很多的妻子和母亲，”得法热夫人说，“并且我们也见过很多的丈夫和父亲被送进监狱关押了好多年。有这么多的人，再多一个又算得了什么呢? ”</p>
<p>As the Defarges left, Lucie turned to Mr Lorry. 'I am more afraid of her than of any other person in Paris, 'she whispered. Mr Lorry held her hands；he did not say anything, but he was also very worried.</p>
<p>当得法热夫妇走后，路茜冲劳里先生转过身去。“在巴黎，没有比她更使我害怕的人了，”她小声说。劳里先生抓住她的手，什么也没说，但是也很担心。</p>
<p>The Doctor did not come back from La Force for several days. During that time eleven hundred prisoners were killed by the people. Inside the prison Dr Manette had come before a Tribunal, which was a group of judges appointed by the people. These judges made their own laws and threw prisoners out into the streets to be murdered by the crowds. Dr Manette told the Tribunal that he had been a prisoner in the Bastille for eighteen years, and that his son－in－law was now a prisoner in La Force. The Tribunal had agreed to keep Charles Darnay safe from the murdering crowds, but they would not let him leave the prison.</p>
<p>已有好几天了医生还没从拉弗尔斯回来。就在那段时间里有1100名囚犯被人杀死了。在监狱里马内特医生曾前去见一个审判团，是一组由人民指定的法官。这些法官们制定了自己的法律，并把罪犯们扔到大街上让人们处死。马内特医生告诉审判团他曾经在巴士底狱当了18年的囚徒，而现在他的女婿在拉弗尔斯蹲监狱。审判团同意保护查尔斯&middot;代尔那不受街上人群的伤害。但他们不准他离开监狱。</p>
<p>Dr Manette seemed to become stronger as he lived through these terrible days, doing everything he could to save his daughter's husband. He was able to see Darnay regularly, but noblemen and emigrants were hated by the citizens of new France, and the Doctor could not set Darnay free. The Guillotine, that new machine of death, cut off the heads of many, many people—the powerful and the cruel, but also the beautiful, the innocent, and the good. Each day Lucie did not know if her husband would live or die. She lived every moment in great fear, but her father was sure that he could save his son－ in－law.</p>
<p>在这些恐怖的日子里生活，马内特医生似乎变得更强健了，竭尽全力地去救他的女婿。他经常能看到代尔那，但贵族和流亡者是遭到新法兰西公民的痛恨的，这样医生便不能救代尔那出来。那座断头台——那新的死亡机器，砍掉了许许多多权贵和暴虐者的人头。但也有美丽、无辜且善良的人被斩首。每天路茜都不知道她丈夫会活下来还是会死去，她每一刻钟都生活在恐惧中，可她的父亲相信他能救出女婿。</p>
<p>One year and three months passed and Darnay was still in prison. Dr Manette now had an official job as doctor to three prisons and was able to visit Darnay regularly. He became more and more loved by the rough people of the Revolution. But the Guillotine continued to kill.</p>
<p>一年零三个月过去了，代尔那仍然在监81狱里。马内特医生现在有了一个官方工作，那就是做三个监狱的医生，于是他可以经常去看代尔那。他越来越被那些粗鲁的革命者所喜爱了，但是断头台仍旧在杀人。</p>
<p>'Try not to worry, 'he told Lucie. 'Nothing can happen to Charles. I know that I can save him. 'But Lucie could not see him or visit him；she could not even write to him.</p>
<p>“尽量别去担心，”他告诉路茜说。“查尔斯不会有什么事的。我知道我能救他。”可路茜不能见他或去探望他，甚至不能给他写信。</p>
<p>On the day when Charles Darnay was at last called for his trial, Lucie and Dr Manette hurried to Tellson's Bank to tell Mr Lorry. As they arrived, a man got up and disappeared into another room. They did not see who it was, but in fact it was Sydney Carton, just arrived from London.</p>
<p>在查尔斯&middot;代尔那最终被审讯的那天，路茜和马内特医生匆忙到台尔森银行告诉了劳里先生。他们到达时，有一个人站起身来消失在另一个房间里。他们没有看清那是谁，但实际上他是西得尼&middot;卡登，他刚从伦敦来。</p>
<p>There were five judges in the Tribunal, and the trials were short and simple. The voices of truth, honesty, and calm reason were never heard at these trials, and most of the prisoners were sent to the Guillotine, which pleased the noisy crowds. Fifteen prisoners were called before Darnay that day, and in no more than an hour and a half, all of them had been condemned to death.</p>
<p>审判团由5名法官组成，审判很简短。在这些审判中，真实、诚实、合理的申辩根本不被听取，因而大多数罪犯都被送上了断头台，以取悦那些吵吵嚷嚷的人们。那天在代尔那之前已有15个人被审讯，在不到一个半小时的时间中，他们便都被判处了死刑。</p>
<p>'Charles Evr&eacute;monde, who is called Darnay. '</p>
<p>“查尔斯&middot;埃弗蒙，那个称作代尔那的人。”</p>
<p>As Darnay walked in front of the judges, he tried to remember the careful advice that Dr Manette had given him.</p>
<p>在走到法官面前时，代尔那尽力去回想马内特医生给他的周详的忠告。</p>
<p>'Charles Evr&eacute;monde, you are an emigrant. All emigrants must die. That is the new law of France. '</p>
<p>“查尔斯&middot;埃弗蒙，你是个流亡者。所有的流亡者都得死，这是法兰西的新法律。”</p>
<p>'Kill him！'shouted the people. 'Cut off his head！He's an enemy of the people！'</p>
<p>“杀了他！”人们喊着。“砍下他的头！他是人民的敌人！”</p>
<p>The President of the judges asked Darnay, 'Is it true that you lived many years in England? '</p>
<p>首席法官问代尔那：“你在英国住了很多年，这属实吗? ”</p>
<p>'Yes, that is true, 'replied Darnay.</p>
<p>“是的，属实。”代尔那答道。</p>
<p>So you are an emigrant, surely. '</p>
<p>“那么你肯定是个流亡者啰。”</p>
<p>'No, not in the meaning of the law, 'replied Darnay. 'I earn my own living in England. I have never wanted or used the name of Marquis, and I did not want to live by the work of the poor people of France. So I went to live and work in England, long before the Revolution. '</p>
<p>“不，按法律规定不是的，”代尔那回答。“我在英国自谋生计，从来没有要过或用过侯爵的称号，我也不曾想过要靠可怜的法国人民的劳作而生活，所以我才去英国生活和工作的，这是革命之前很久的事了。”</p>
<p>'And did you marry in England? '</p>
<p>“那么你在英国结婚了吗? ”</p>
<p>'Yes, I married a Frenchwoman. The daughter of Dr Manette, a prisoner of the Bastille and a well－known friend of all good citizens！'</p>
<p>“是的，我娶了一个法国女人，是马内特医生的女儿。他是巴士底狱的囚犯，是所有好公民的知名朋友！”</p>
<p>These words had a happy effect on the crowd. Those who had shouted for his death now shouted for his life. Then Monsieur Gabelle and Dr Manette spoke for Charles Darnay. The Doctor spoke well and clearly, and was very popular with the crowd. When he had finished, the judges decided that the prisoner should be set free, and the crowd shouted their agreement loudly. Soon they were carrying Darnay in a chair through the streets of Paris to Dr Manette's house. Lucie was waiting there, and when she ran out and fell into the arms of her husband, the men and women in the crowd kissed one another and danced for happiness Darnay and Lucie were together again, safe and happy.</p>
<p>这些话在人群中产生了好的影响，那些刚才还嚷着要他死的人现在又嚷着要他活下来。后来加贝尔先生和马内特医生也都为查尔斯&middot;代尔那说话。医生说得很好又很清楚，而且他很受人们的欢迎。在他结束了讲话后，法官们决定释放囚犯。人们也大声喊着同意，很快他们便用椅子抬着代尔那穿过巴黎的街道去了马内特医生住的屋子。路茜正在那儿等着，当她冲出来投入她丈夫的怀抱时，人群中的男男女女互相亲吻并为他们的幸福而起舞。代尔那和路茜又安全幸福地待在了一起。</p>
<p>'I told you that I would save him, 'said Lucie's father proudly. 'Well, I have saved him, and you must not worry now. '</p>
<p>“我告诉过你我会把他救出来的，”路茜的父亲骄傲地说。“好了，我已经救出了他，你就不用再担心了。”</p>
<p>But Lucie was still worried. So many innocent men and women had died, for no reason, and every day brought more deaths. A shadow of fear and hate lay over France, and no one knew what dangers the next day would bring.</p>
<p>但是路茜仍旧担心。已有那么多无辜的男男女女毫无道理地死了，并且每天都有更多的人死亡。恐惧和仇恨的阴影笼罩着法国，没有人知道明天会带来什么危险。</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>It was not possible to leave Paris at once, as Charles did not have the necessary papers. They must live quietly, and hope to leave as soon as they could.</p>
<p>查尔斯不能马上离开法国，因为没有拿到必须的证件。他们必须静悄悄地生活，并寄希望于能尽快离开。</p>
<p>But that night, when Dr Manette, Charles and Lucie were sitting together, they heard a loud knock at the door.</p>
<p>但是那天晚上，当马内特医生，查尔斯和路茜正在一起坐着时，他们听到了很响的敲门声。</p>
<p>'What can this be? 'said Lucie, trembling. 'Hide Charles！ Save him！'</p>
<p>“会是什么人呢? ”路茜颤抖着说。“把查尔斯藏起来，救救他！”</p>
<p>'My child, 'said the Doctor, 'I have saved him. He is a free man！'</p>
<p>“我的孩子，”医生说，“我已经救回了他。他现在是个自由人！”</p>
<p>But when he opened the door, four rough men pushed their way into the room.</p>
<p>但是当他打开门时，四个粗壮的人闯进了房间。</p>
<p>'The Citizen Evr&eacute;monde, where is he? He is again the prisoner of the people. '</p>
<p>“公民埃弗蒙，他在哪儿? 他又成了人民的囚徒了。”</p>
<p>'I am here, 'said Darnay. 'But why am I again a prisoner? '</p>
<p>“我在这儿，”代尔那说。“可是我为什么又成了犯人呢? ”</p>
<p>'You are accused by citizens of Saint Antoine. '</p>
<p>“圣安东尼的公民们指控你了。”</p>
<p>Dr Manette had said nothing. He seemed to be made of stone, but suddenly he spoke.</p>
<p>马内特医生没有说什么。他仿佛成了一个木头人；但他突然说道：</p>
<p>'Will you tell me who has accused my son－in－law? '</p>
<p>“你能告诉我谁指控我的女婿吗? ”</p>
<p>'I shouldn't tell you this, 'said one of the men, 'but Citizen Evr&eacute;monde, called Darnay, is accused by Monsieur and Madame Defarge, and by one other person. '</p>
<p>“我本不该告诉你的，”其中一个人说，“可是公民埃弗蒙，即所谓的代尔那是被得法热先生及夫人还有另外一个人指控的。”</p>
<p>'What other? '</p>
<p>“另外那个人是谁? ”</p>
<p>'You will hear that tomorrow, 'replied the man.</p>
<p>“你明天就会听到了。”那个人说。</p><a href='9.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
