<p><b>10 秘密纸条 </b></p>
<p>When Charles Darnay was led before the Tribunal the next morning, Dr Manette, Lucie and Mr Lorry were all there. The love in Lucie's eyes as she looked at her husband warmed Darnay's heart. It had the same effect on Sydney Carton, though no one saw him standing at the back of the room.</p>
<p>在第二天早晨查尔斯&middot;代尔那被带到审判团面前时，马内特医生、路茜和劳里先生都在那儿。路茜看着她丈夫，眼中充满了爱，这使代尔那心中充满了温暖。它对西得尼&middot;卡登产生了同样的影响，虽然没有人看见他站在屋子的后面。</p>
<p>It was the same Tribunal who had let Darnay go free on the day before. But Revolution Laws were not as powerful as the anger of the people.</p>
<p>这就是前一天释放代尔那的那同一个审判团，但是革命的法律的威力毕竟没有人民的愤怒那样强大。</p>
<p>The President of the Tribunal asked, 'Who has accused Charles Evr&eacute;monde again? '</p>
<p>审判团首席法官问：“是谁又一次指控查尔斯&middot;埃弗蒙? ”</p>
<p>'Three voices, 'he was told. 'He is accused by Ernest Defarge, by Teresa Defarge his wife, and by Alexandre Manette, Doctor. '</p>
<p>“有3个人指控，”他被人告知说。“他被恩斯特&middot;得法热、他的妻子特丽莎&middot;得法热以及医生亚历山大&middot;马内特所指控。”</p>
<p>There was a great noise in the room when Dr Manette's name was heard. When the shouting stopped, Dr Manette stood, pale and trembling.</p>
<p>当马内特医生的名字被提到后，屋子里响起了一阵巨大的哄闹声。当这些声音停下来时，马内特医生站起身来，脸色煞白浑身发抖。</p>
<p>'President, this cannot be true. You know that the man who is accused, Charles Darnay, is my daughter's husband. My daughter and those who are dear to her are far more important to me than my life. Where is the liar who says that I accuse my daughter's husband? '</p>
<p>“首席法官，这不可能是真的。你知道被指控的人查尔斯&middot;代尔那是我女儿的丈夫。而我的女儿以及那些爱她的人对我来说远比我的生命都重要。那个说我指控我女儿丈夫的骗子在哪儿? ”</p>
<p>'Citizen Manette, 'said the President, 'be calm. Nothing can be more important to a good citizen than the freedom of France. '</p>
<p>“马内特公民，”首席法官说，“冷静点。对一个好公民来说没有什么比法兰西的自由更重要的。”</p>
<p>Defarge came forward to answer questions. He told how he had been at the Bastille at the beginning of the Revolution, when that. hated prison had been taken by the citizens.</p>
<p>得法热走上前来回答问题。他告诉人们在革命开始时当那令人憎恶的巴士底监狱被公民们攻占时，他是如何到里面去的。</p>
<p>'I knew that Dr Manette had been kept in a room known as One Hundred and Five, North Tower. It was the only name he had when he came to me in 1775. I went to the room and, hid-den in a hole, I found a written paper. It is in Dr Manette's writing. '</p>
<p>“我那时知道马内特医生曾被关在北塔105号牢房，这是他在1775年见到我时的唯一的名字。我去了那个牢房，并在一个隐蔽的小洞里找到了一张写着字的纸，那是马内特医生的手迹。</p>
<p>'Read it to us, 'said the President, and the crowd fell silent and listened.</p>
<p>“给我们念念。”首席法官说完，人们便坐下来静听。</p>
<p>I, Alexandre Manette, write this in the Bastille in 1767. I have been here for ten long years and I write this in my secret moments, when I can.</p>
<p>我，亚历山大&middot;马内特，在1767年巴士底狱中写下这篇记录。我已经在这儿待了漫长的10年了，我是在我能够写作的秘密时刻写这封信的。</p>
<p>One evening in December, 1757, I was walking by the River Seine and a coach stopped beside me. Two men got out and one asked me if I was Dr Manette. When I replied that I was, they asked me to go with them, and made it clear that I could not refuse.</p>
<p>在1757年12月的一个晚上，我正沿着塞纳河散步，一辆马车停在了我身边。车上走下两个男人，其中一个问我是不是马内特医生。当我回答说是后，他们便要我跟他们一起走，而且明确告诉我，不能拒绝。</p>
<p>The coach left Paris and stopped at a lonely house. I could hear cries coming from a room upstairs. When I went in, I saw a young woman lying on a bed. She was young and very beautiful. She was also very ill. She kept crying out, ' My husband, my father, and my brother！'Then she listened for a moment, and began once again, 'My husband, my father, and my brother…'</p>
<p>马车离开巴黎，在一座孤零零的房子前停了下来。我听到从楼上房间里传来了哭喊声。在我走进去时，我看见一个年轻女子躺在一张床上。她年轻而且很漂亮。她病得也很厉害，一直在哭喊着：“我丈夫、我父亲，还有我弟弟！”然后她倾听了一会儿，又开始哭喊起来，“我丈夫、我父亲，还有我弟弟……。”</p>
<p>I gave the girl something to make her calmer, but her feverish screams continued. Then I turned to question the two men. They were clearly brothers, and their clothes and voices suggested that they were noblemen. But they took care to prevent me from learning their name.</p>
<p>我给那女孩服了一些可以使她平静下来的药。但她狂躁的叫声还是继续着。后来我转身去询问那两个男人，他们显然是兄弟俩，并且他们的穿着和说话腔调表明他们是贵族，可他们提防着不让我知道他们的名字。</p>
<p>Before I could speak, the older brother said carelessly, 'There is another patient. 'In a different room, they showed me a boy of about seventeen. There was a sword wound in his chest and I could see at once that he was dying.</p>
<p>我还没来得及说话，那个哥哥便不在乎地说：“这儿还有一个病人。”在另一个房间里，他们指给我看一个17岁左右的男孩。他的前胸有一道剑伤，我一眼就看出他快要死了。</p>
<p>'How did this happen? 'I asked.</p>
<p>“这是怎么回事? ”我问道。</p>
<p>'He's just a crazy young peasant. He came here shouting about revenge, and made my brother fight him. 'The older brother's voice was cold and hard；he seemed to think the boy was less important than a horse or a dog.</p>
<p>“他只是一个发了疯的小农民，他来这儿大喊大叫着报仇。于是迫使我弟弟和他打了起来。”那位哥哥的声音冷酷而生硬；他似乎觉得这个男孩还不如一匹马或一条狗。</p>
<p>The boy's eyes looked at me. 'Have you seen her…my sister? 'It was hard for him to speak.</p>
<p>那个男孩的眼睛看着我。“您见到她了吗……我姐姐? ”他说话很吃力。</p>
<p>'I have seen her, 'I replied.</p>
<p>“我已经见到她了。”我答道。</p>
<p>'These rich nobles are cruel to us, Doctor. They destroy our land, they take our food, they steal our sisters. My sister loved a man in our village；he was sick, but she married him to take care of him But my sister is beautiful, and that nobleman's brother saw her and wanted her. They made her husband work night and day without stopping, until he dropped dead where he stood. Then they took my sister away. When my father heard what had happened, the news was too much for his poor heart and he died suddenly. I took my younger sister to a place where she is safe, and came here to find this man. He threw some money at me, tried to buy me like a dog, but I made him pull his sword and fight me to save his life. '</p>
<p>“这些有钱的贵族们对我们很残忍，医生。他们毁坏我们的土地，拿走我们的食物，他们抢走了我的姐姐。我姐姐爱上了我们村子里的一个人；他生了病，但是她还是嫁给了他以便照料他。可因为我姐姐长得漂亮，那个贵族的弟弟见到了她便想占有她。他们强迫她的丈夫日夜工作，不得休息，直到在他站着的地方倒下去死了，然后他们就把我姐姐抢走了。在我父亲听到所发生的这些事后，他虚弱的心脏承受不住这一打击，也猝然死去了。我把我的小妹妹带到了一个安全的地方，然后来这儿找这个人。他扔给我一些钱，企图像买一只狗那样收买我，可我迫使他抽出了他的剑，他要活命，就要同我决斗。”</p>
<p>The boy's life was going fast, but he cried, ' Lift me, Doctor. 'He turned his face towards the older brother. 'Marquis, 'he said loudly, 'I call for you and your brother, and all your family, now and in the future, to pay for what you have done. 'Then he fell back, dead.</p>
<p>这个男孩的生命很快就要完结了，但他却喊道：“扶我起来，医生。”他把脸转向那个哥哥：“侯爵，”他大声说，“我诅咒你和你的弟弟以及你所有的家人，无论现在还是将来，都得为你们的所做所为受到惩罚。”然后他便倒地而死。</p>
<p>The young woman's fever continued, but I could not save her. She lived for several more days, and once the Marquis said to me, 'How long these peasants take to die！'</p>
<p>那个年轻女子还持续地发着烧，但我救不了她。她又活了几天，于是有一次侯爵对我说：“这些农民真难死啊！”</p>
<p>When she was dead, the brothers warned me to keep silent. They offered me money, but I refused it and was taken back to my home.</p>
<p>在她死后，这兄弟俩警告我要保持缄默。他们给了我钱但我没有要，于是我被送回了家。</p>
<p>The next day I decided to write to the King's officials. I knew that nobles who did unlawful things were usually not punished, and expected that nothing would happen. But I did not realize the danger for myself. Just as I had finished writing my letter, a lady came to see me. She said she was the wife of the Marquis of Evr&eacute;monde and she had discovered what her husband and his brother had done. She wanted to help the younger sister of the girl who had died, and asked me where she could find her. Sadly, I did not know and so could not tell her. But that was how I learnt the brothers' name.</p>
<p>第二天我决定给国王的官员们写信。我知道贵族们做了违法的事情常常得不到惩罚，而且我料到不会有什么结果的。但我没意识到自身的危险。就在我写完信后，一位女士来见我，她说她是埃弗蒙侯爵的妻子，并且已经发现了她丈夫和他弟弟所干的事情。她想要帮助那个已死的女孩子的小妹妹，于是问我她在哪儿能找到她。不幸的是，我不知道，因而也无法告诉她。但我却因此知道了那两个兄弟的名字。</p>
<p>The wife of the Marquis was a good, kind woman, deeply unhappy in her marriage. She had brought her son with her, a boy about three years old. 'If I cannot find this poor girl, 'she said, 'I shall tell my son to continue the search after my death. You will remember that, little Charles, won't you? '</p>
<p>侯爵的妻子是一个好心善良的女人，她对婚姻深感不幸。她还带来了她的儿子，一个大约3岁的男孩。“如果我找不到这个可怜的女孩儿，”她说，“我会告诉我的儿子在我死后继续找她。你要记住，小查尔斯，好吗? ”</p>
<p>The child answered, 'yes！'</p>
<p>那个小孩回答说：“好的！”</p>
<p>Later that day I sent my letter to the King's officials and that night there was a knock at my door. My servant, a boy called Ernest Defarge, brought in a stranger, who asked me to come at once to visit a sick man in the next street.</p>
<p>那天的晚些时候我把我的信寄给了国王的官员们；当晚就有人敲我家的门。我的仆人，一个叫恩斯特&middot;得法热的男子带进来一个陌生人，叫我立刻去邻街看一个病人。</p>
<p>As soon as I was outside the house, several men took hold of me violently The Evr&eacute;monde brothers came out of the darkness and the Marquis took my letter out of his pocket, showed it to me, and burned it. Not a word was spoken. Then I was brought here to this prison, my living grave.</p>
<p>我刚走出房子，便有好几个人猛地抓住了我，埃弗蒙兄弟从黑暗中走出来，侯爵从他兜里拿出了我写的信，给我看了一眼便烧了。什么话也没说，然后我就被带到了这个监狱，我的活坟墓。</p>
<p>I have been here for ten long years. I do not know if my dear wife is alive or dead；these brothers have sent me no news of my family. There is no goodness in their cruel hearts. I, Alexandre Manette, in my pain and sadness, I condemn them in the face of God.</p>
<p>我已经在这里待了漫长的10年了。我不知道我心爱的妻子是死是活。这对兄弟没有给过我任何有关我家里的消息。他们残酷的心中没有一点仁慈。我，亚历山大&middot;马内特在痛苦和悲伤之中，在上帝面前谴责他们。</p>
<p>When Defarge had finished reading, a terrible sound rose from the crowd, a long wild cry of anger and revenge. Death for the hated Marquis of Evr&eacute;monde, enemy of the people！The trial was over, and in less than twenty-four hours Charles Darnay would go to the Guillotine.</p>
<p>当得法热念完之后，一阵可怕的声音从人群中响起，那是愤怒和复仇的狂呼。人民痛恨的敌人埃弗蒙侯爵该死！审判结束了，在不到24小时之后，查尔斯&middot;代尔那就要走上断头台了。</p><a href='11.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
