<p><b>5 两个男人谈论爱情 </b></p>
<p>Twelve months after the death of the Marquis in France, Charles Darnay had become a successful teacher of French in London. He had known, when he came to London, that he would have to work hard to earn his living, and he was successful. He was also in love. He had loved Lucie Manette from the time when his life was in danger in the Old Bailey. He had never heard a sound so sweet as her gentle voice；he had never seen a face so beautiful as hers. But he had never spoken to her about his love. The death of his uncle in France had become, over the twelve months, like a dream to him, but he had said nothing to Lucie of his feelings, nor of what had happened. He had good reason for this.</p>
<p>法国侯爵死了12个月之后，查尔斯&middot;代尔那已经在伦敦成了一名成功的法语教师。在他前往伦敦时他就知道自己将不得不靠勤奋的工作谋生。他现在成功了。同时他还陷入了爱河之中。还在他的生命在旧巴勒处于危险的境地时，他就已经爱上了路茜&middot;马内特。他从未听到过像她那么甜蜜的声音，他也从未见过她那么美丽的脸庞。可他从未向她表白过爱慕之情。他在法国的叔叔的死在12个月之后，对他来说已经成了一个梦。但他没有对路茜说过他的感受，也从未提起过所发生的事情。对此他自有理由。</p>
<p>But one day in the summer he came to Dr Manette's home in London. He knew that Lucie was out with Miss Pross, and he had decided to speak to her father. Dr Manette was now strong in body and mind, and sad memories of his long years in prison did not come back to him often. When Darnay arrived, the Doctor welcomed him warmly.</p>
<p>但是夏季的一天他去到伦敦马内特医生家。他知道路茜和普罗斯小姐出去了。他已决定要和她的父亲谈一谈。马内特医生的身心现在都已很强壮，过去漫长的监狱生活的悲伤记忆已不常浮现在他眼前了。代尔那来时，医生热情地欢迎了他。</p>
<p>'Dr Manette, ' said Darnay, 'I know that Lucie is out. But I have come here today to speak to you.'</p>
<p>“马内特医生，”代尔那说，“我知道路茜出去了。但我今天到这儿来是想和您谈谈的。”</p>
<p>There was a silence.'Do you want to speak to me about Lucie?' asked the Doctor, slowly.</p>
<p>一阵沉默。“你是想和我谈谈路茜的吧?”医生慢慢地问道。</p>
<p>'Yes. Dear Dr Manette, I love your daughter dearly. If there was ever love in the world, I love Lucie.'</p>
<p>“是的，亲爱的马内特医生，我深深地爱着您的女儿。如果这世界上有爱情的话，那么我就爱路茜。”</p>
<p>'I believe you, ' said Dr Manette sadly.' It's very hard for me to speak of her at any time, but I believe you, Charles Darnay. Have you spoken to Lucie about your love?'</p>
<p>“我相信你，”马内特医生忧伤地说。“任何时候谈起她对我来说都很困难，但我相信你，查尔斯&middot;代尔那。你对路茜表白过你对她的爱了吗?”</p>
<p>'No, never. I know how much your daughter means to you, Dr Manette. Her love for you, and your love for her, these are the greatest things in your life, and in hers. I love Lucie. With all my heart I love her. But I do not want to come between you and her. The two of you will never be separated because of me.'</p>
<p>“没有，从来没有过。我知道您女儿对您来说多么重要，马内特医生。她对您的爱和您对她的爱都是您的及她的生命中最重要的东西。我爱路茜，全心全意地爱她。但是我不想打破你们的关系。你们两个人将永不会因为我而分开。”</p>
<p>For a moment Dr Manette turned his head away, and his eyes were full of fear, and pain. Then he looked back at Darnay, and tried to smile.</p>
<p>有一阵儿马内特医生把头侧转过去，眼中充满了恐惧和痛苦。后来他转过头来看着代尔那，尽力装出一副笑脸。</p>
<p>'You have spoken very honestly, Charles, ' he said.'Have you any reason to believe that Lucie loves you?'</p>
<p>“你说得很诚恳，查尔斯，”他说。“你有什么理由相信路茜爱你吗?”</p>
<p>'None！'</p>
<p>“没有！”</p>
<p>'Then what do you want from me?'</p>
<p>“那么你想从我这儿得到什么呢?”</p>
<p>'A promise. A promise that if Lucie ever tells you that she loves me, you will not speak against me, and will tell her what I have said. I know that she would never accept me if she believed that it would make you unhappy.'</p>
<p>“承诺。这个承诺就是一旦路茜告诉您她爱我，那么您就不要说反对的话，并且告诉她我所说的这些话。我知道如果她认为您会痛苦，那就绝不会接受我的爱。”</p>
<p>'I can promise you more than that, Charles. If Lucie ever tells me that she loves you, I shall give her to you.'</p>
<p>“我可以承诺更多的东西，查尔斯。如果路茜告诉我说她爱你，我就会把她交给你。”</p>
<p>'Thank you, Dr Manette, 'said Darnay, gratefully.'There is one thing more. My name in England is not my real name. I want to tell you what my real name is, and why I am in England.'</p>
<p>“谢谢您，马内特医生。”代尔那感激地说。“还有一件事，我在英国的名字不是我的真实姓名，我想告诉您我的真实姓名，还有我来英国的原因。”</p>
<p>'Stop！'said the Doctor. He had even put his hands over his ears.'I don't want to know. Tell me when I ask you. If Lucie agrees to marry you, you shall tell me on the morning of your marriage.'</p>
<p>“打住！”医生说。他甚至已经用手捂住了耳朵。“我不想知道。我问你时你再告诉我吧。如果路茜同意嫁给你，你就要在你们结婚的那天早晨告诉我。”</p>
<p>It was dark when Darnay left Dr Manette, and it was some time later when Lucie and Miss Pross came home.</p>
<p>代尔那离开马内特医生时天已经黑了。路茜和普罗斯小姐晚些时候才回家。</p>
<p>'Father, ' Lucie called, 'where are you?' She heard no answer, but there were strange sounds coming from her father's bedroom Frightened, she ran upstairs and found her father, pale and silent, busy at his old prison work of making shoes. The shadow of the Bastille had fallen on him again. She took his arm and spoke gently to him, and together they walked up and down for a long time until at last Dr Manette went quietly to bed.</p>
<p>“爸爸，”路茜喊道，“您在哪儿?”她没有听到回答，可是从她父亲的卧室里传来了些奇怪的声音。路茜吓坏了，她跑上楼去见到了父亲，脸色苍白，正在悄无声息地忙着做在监狱里干的老活计——做鞋子。巴士底狱的阴影又一次降临到了他身上。她抓住了父亲的手，温柔地对他说着话，并且和他一起来来回回走了很长时间，直到最后马内特医生安静地上了床睡觉。</p>
<p>Although Mr Carton visited Dr Manette's house quite often, he usually said very little when he was there. One day in August he arrived when Dr Manette was out and he was received by Lucie. She had always been a little shy with him, but on that day she noticed something different in his face.</p>
<p>尽管卡登先生经常拜访马内特医生家，但他来时总是很少说话。8月的一天他来时马内特医生出去了，路茜接待了他。她在他面前总是有点害羞，但在那天她注意到了他的脸上有种不同以往的神情。</p>
<p>'Aren't you well, Mr Carton?' she asked.</p>
<p>“您不舒服吗，卡登先生?”她问。</p>
<p>'No, probably not, Miss Manette, but my way of life is not good for my health.'</p>
<p>“不，大概不是吧，马内特小姐。只是我的生活方式对健康不好。”</p>
<p>'That seems sad, ' said Lucie gently.'Why do you not change your way of life?'</p>
<p>“那可太不幸了，”路茜柔声说，“您为什么不改变一下您的生活方式呢?”</p>
<p>'It's too late for that. I shall never be better than I am. But, Miss Manette, there is something that I want to say to you, but I find it so difficult. Will you listen to me?'</p>
<p>“那太晚了。我永远不会比现在有什么起色了。但是，马内特小姐，我有一件事想对您说，但又发现这太难了。您会听我说吗?”</p>
<p>'If it will help you, Mr Carton, I will be happy to listen to you, ' said Lucie, but she was pale and trembling.</p>
<p>“如果那对您有帮助的话，卡登先生，我会乐意听您说的。”路茜说。然而她的脸色苍白，浑身发抖。</p>
<p>'Miss Manette, I know that you could never have feelings of love for me, a man who has spent his life so badly.'</p>
<p>“马内恃小姐，我知道您是永远不会对我有爱情的。我这个人生活得这么糟糕。”</p>
<p>'Even without my love, Mr Carton, can I not save you? Can I not help you?'</p>
<p>“即便没有爱情，卡登先生，难道我就不能挽救您吗?我不能帮您吗?”</p>
<p>'No, Miss Manette, ' said Carton.'Even if it was possible for you to love me, it is too late for me. I would only make you sad, and destroy your life. But it has been a last dream of my heart. To see you and your father together, to see the home that you have made for him—this has brought back old and happier memories for me.'</p>
<p>“不，马内特小姐，”卡登说。“即使您可能爱我，那对我来说也已经太晚了。我只会让您伤心，从而毁了您的生活。但那也是我心中最后的一个梦想。能看到您和您的父亲在一起，看到您为他建起的这个家——这已经为我带回了那古老而幸福的回忆。”</p>
<p>'Can I do nothing to help you?' asked Lucie sadly.</p>
<p>“我就不能为您做点儿什么吗?”路茜悲伤地问。</p>
<p>'Only this, Miss Manette. Let me remember that I spoke to you of the feelings of my heart, and that you were kind and gentle towards me.'</p>
<p>“仅此而已，马内特小姐，就让我记住我曾对您说过我心中的感情，而您对我又关怀又体贴。”</p>
<p>'Oh, Mr Carton. Try again to change.'</p>
<p>“哦，卡登先生，再试着去改变一下吧。”</p>
<p>'No, Miss Manette, it is too late. My bad habits will never change now. But tell me that you will never speak of what I have said today, not to anyone, not even to the person dearest to you.'</p>
<p>“不，马内特小姐，这太晚了。我的坏毛病永远也不会改掉了。但是请您告诉我您以后绝不会提起我今天对您说过的话，不要告诉任何人，甚至您最亲爱的人。”</p>
<p>'Mr Carton, ' said Lucie.'This is your secret. No one will ever know of it from me.'</p>
<p>“卡登先生，”路茜说。“这是您的隐私，不会有人从我这儿知道这些的。”</p>
<p>'Thank you, Miss Manette. I shall never speak of this again. But in the hour of my death, it will be a happy memory for me that my last words of love were to you.'</p>
<p>“谢谢您，马内特小姐。我不会再说这些了，但在我死的时候，我会因为我最后的爱情表白是对您说的而留下幸福的回忆。”</p>
<p>Lucie had never heard Mr Carton speak like this before. Tears came to her eyes as she thought of his hopeless, miserable life.</p>
<p>路茜以前从未听过卡登先生这么说过，一想到他绝望、不幸的生活，她的眼里就充满了泪水。</p>
<p>'Don't cry, ' said Sydney Carton.'I am not worth your love. But you should know that for you, or for anyone close to you, I would do anything. Please remember always, that there is a man who would give his life to keep someone you love alive and close to you. Goodbye, Miss Manette.'</p>
<p>“不要哭，”西得尼&middot;卡登说。“我不值得您爱，但是您要知道我会乐意对您或任何您亲近的人做任何事情的。请永远记住，这里有一个男人，他将不惜自己的生命去保护您所爱的人的生命，并为了让他和您永远在一起而不惜一切。再见，马内特小姐。”</p>
<p>On the day of Lucie's marriage to Charles Darnay, Mr Lorry and Miss Pross stood, with Lucie, outside the door of Dr Manette's room. Inside, the Doctor and Mr Darnay had been talking together for a long time.</p>
<p>在路茜嫁给查尔斯&middot;代尔那的这天，劳里先生和普罗斯小姐陪路茜站在马内特医生的房门外。屋子里，医生和代尔那先生已经在一起谈了很长时间。</p>
<p>Soon it would be time to leave for the church. Lucie looked very beautiful, and Mr Lorry watched her proudly. He talked about the day, So long ago, when he had brought Lucie, as a baby in his arms, from France to England. Miss Pross, too, had her memories and thought fondly of her brother Solomon. He had stolen money from her many years ago and she had never seen him since then, but she still loved him.</p>
<p>很快就将是去教堂的时间了。路茜显得非常漂亮。劳里先生骄傲地看着她。他说起了多年前他把路茜抱在怀里从法国去英国那天的事。普罗斯小姐也回忆起往事并深情地想起了她的弟弟所罗门。好多年前他偷了她的钱，从那以后她就再没见过他，但她仍旧爱他。</p>
<p>The door of the Doctor's room opened and he came out with Charles Darnay. The Doctor's face was white, but he was calm. He took his daughter's arm and they went out to the waiting coach. The others followed in a second coach and soon, in a nearby church, Lucie Manette and Charles Darnay were marrined.</p>
<p>医生的房门打开了。他和查尔斯&middot;代尔那走了出来。医生的脸色苍白但仍很镇静。他挽起女儿的胳膊走向已在等候的马车。其他人则乘坐第二辆马车跟随其后。很快路茜&middot;马内特和查尔斯&middot;代尔那就在附近的一个教堂里举行了婚礼。</p>
<p>After the marriage Lucie and Charles came back to the house for breakfast, and then Lucie had to say goodbye to her father for two weeks—the first time they had not been together since his return from Paris.</p>
<p>婚礼结束后路茜和查尔斯回到家里吃早餐，然后路茜不得不和父亲告别两个星期——这是他从巴黎回来后他们第一次分开。</p>
<p>When Lucie and Charles had left, Mr Lorry noticed a change in the Doctor. A little sadness was natural, but there was a lost, frightened look in the Doctor's eyes, which worried Mr Lorry very much. When he left to go to Tellson's Bank, he whispered to Miss Pross that he would return as quickly as he could.</p>
<p>路茜和查尔斯走后，劳里先生注意到医生的变化。有一些伤感是自然的，但是在他的眼睛里有一种失落、恐惧的神情，这使劳里先生非常担忧。在他要去台尔森银行时，他小声对普罗斯小姐说了他将尽快回来。</p>
<p>Two hours later he hurried back to the house, and Miss Pross met him at the door.</p>
<p>两个小时之后他匆忙返回时，普罗斯小姐在门口迎住了他。</p>
<p>'Oh, what shall we do, Mr Lorry?' she cried.'He doesn't know me, and is making shoes again！'</p>
<p>而且又开始做起鞋子来了。”</p>
<p>Mr Lorry went up to the Doctor's room.'Dr Manette, my dear friend. Look at me. Don't you remember me?'</p>
<p>劳里先生上楼来到医生的房间。“马内特医生，我亲爱的朋友，看着我，你不记得我了吗?”</p>
<p>But Dr Manette said nothing and worked on in silence. Once again, he was a prisoner in the Bastille, without friends or family, without even a name of his own.</p>
<p>可马内特医生什么话也没说，只是默默地做着他的活儿。他又成了巴士底狱里的囚犯了，没有朋友，没有家，甚至连名字都没有。</p>
<p>For nine days and nine nights the shoemaker worked on, leaving his table only to sleep, eat, or walk up and down his room. Mr Lorry sat with him night and day, talking gently to him from time to time, trying to bring his friend's mind back to the present.</p>
<p>连着9天9夜鞋匠一直在做他的活儿，只是在睡觉，吃饭或在屋子里走来走去时才离开工作台。劳里先生日夜陪着他，时不时地轻声和他说着话，竭力想把他朋友的思绪带回到现实中来。</p>
<p>Then at last, on the tenth morning, the shoemaking work was put away, and Dr Alexandre Manette, pale but calm, was his old self again. Lucie was never told, and in the quiet and happy years that followed her marriage, Dr Manette remained strong in mind and body.</p>
<p>最后，在第10天的早晨，做鞋的工作被抛到了一边。亚历山大&middot;马内特医生——脸色苍白却很平静，这时又恢复了他应有的神情。路茜没有被告知这些，而且在她婚后宁静而幸福的日子里，马内特医生始终保持着强健的心理和身体状态。</p><a href='6.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
