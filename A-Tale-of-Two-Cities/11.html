<p><b>11 得法热夫人的报复 </b></p>
<p>Lucie held out her arms to her husband. 'Let me kiss him, one last time. '</p>
<p>路茜向他的丈夫伸出双臂。“让我吻吻他，最后一次。”</p>
<p>Most of the citizens had gone out into the streets to shout how they hated the prisoners, but Barsad was still there.</p>
<p>大多数公民已经走上街头，喊着他们是多么痛恨这个罪犯，可巴萨德仍旧留在那儿。</p>
<p>'Let her kiss her husband, 'he said. 'It's just for a minute. '</p>
<p>“让她吻一下她丈夫吧，”他说，“只须一分钟。”</p>
<p>Lucie went over to her husband and he took her in his arms. Dr Manette followed his daughter and fell on his knees before them, but Darnay pulled him to his feet, saying,</p>
<p>路茜走向她丈夫，他便把她搂在怀里。马内特医生跟着女儿并在他们面前跪了下来，但代尔那把他拉了起来，说道：</p>
<p>'No, no. Now we know how much you suffered, especially when you knew whose son I was. But you kept your feelings secret, because of your love for Lucie. We thank you, with all our hearts, for what you did. I tried so hard to do what my mother had wished, but I never found that poor girl. And how could that terrible story ever have a happy ending? '</p>
<p>“不，不，现在我们知道您受了多少苦，尤其是当您知道我是谁的儿子的时候。可您隐藏着您的感情，是为着您对路茜的爱。我们谢谢您所做的事情，由衷地谢谢您。我尽力去做了我母亲希望我做的事，可我一直没有找到那个可怜的女孩。况且那么一个可怕的故事怎么会有一个幸福的结局呢? ”</p>
<p>He turned to his wife. 'My dearest love, we shall meet again, in the place where there are no worries. God be with you both. '</p>
<p>他转向他的妻子：“我最亲爱的，我们会再相见的。在无忧无虑的地方，上帝与你们两个人同在。”</p>
<p>As Darnay was taken away, Lucie fell to the floor, unconscious. Sydney Carton came quickly forward to help Mr Lorry and Dr Manette He carried Lucie to her coach and she was taken home. Then he carried her into the house where her daughter and Miss Pross waited, tears falling from their eyes.</p>
<p>当代尔那被带走后，路茜倒在地上，不醒人事。西得尼&middot;卡登快步走过来帮劳里先生和马内特医生的忙。他把路茜抱上了马车送她回家，然后他把她抱进了她女儿和普罗斯小姐等候着的房子，泪水从她们的眼中落下来。</p>
<p>'Before I go, 'said Sydney Carton, 'may I kiss her? 'He touched Lucie's face lightly with his lips, whispered a few words, and went into the next room.</p>
<p>“我走之前，”西得尼&middot;卡登说，“我能吻吻她吗? ”他的嘴唇轻轻地吻了路茜的脸颊，小声地说了几句话，然后走进了旁边的一个房间。</p>
<p>'You are still very popular with the citizens, Doctor. You must try again to talk to the judges. '</p>
<p>“您在公民中仍旧很受欢迎，医生。您必须尽力再同法官们谈谈。”</p>
<p>'I'll do everything I can. Everything, 'Dr Manette said.</p>
<p>“我会去做我所能做的一切事情的。一切事情。”马内特医生说。劳里先生和卡登一起走到了门口。</p>
<p>Mr Lorry went with Carton to the door.</p>
<p>“我不抱希望了。”劳里先生悲哀地低声说道。</p>
<p>'I have no hope, whispered Mr Lorry sadly.</p>
<p>“我也不抱希望了。”卡登回答。</p>
<p>'Nor have I, 'replied Carton. 'After today, no judge in Paris would even try to save him. The people would be too angry. I will return here later, to see if there is any news, but there is no real hope. '</p>
<p>“过了今天，巴黎甚至将不会有法官去救他了，人们会过于愤怒的。我过一会儿再来，看看是否有什么消息，但是不会有真正的指望了。”</p>
<p>He left the house and began to walk quickly towards Saint Antoine. His face was calm and serious；he looked like a man who had decided to do something. 'I must show myself to the people here, 'he thought. 'They should know that there is a man like me in the city. '</p>
<p>他离开了房子便快步向圣安东尼走去，他的脸平静而严肃，看上去像一个已下定决心要去做件大事的人。“我得向这里的人展示一下我自己。”他想：“他们得知道在这个城市里有一个像我这样的男人。”</p>
<p>In Defarge's wine－shop the only customer was Jacques Three, who had been on the Tribunal that had decided Darnay should die. When Carton sat down and asked for a glass of wine, Madame Defarge looked at him carelessly at first. Then much more carefully. She went back to her husband and Jacques Three, who were talking. 'He is very much like Evr&eacute;monde, 'she said softly.</p>
<p>得法热的酒店里唯一的一名顾客是雅克三，他刚去参加了判处代尔那死刑的那个审判会。在卡登坐下要一杯酒时，得法热夫人起初不在意地看着他，接着便非常仔细地看起他来。她回到正在谈话的她丈夫和雅克三身边，轻声地说：“他可真像埃弗蒙。”</p>
<p>Defarge himself looked at Carton and said, 'Yes, but only a little, 'and the three continued their conversation. Carton listened carefully, while pretending to read a newspaper.</p>
<p>得法热自己看着卡登说：“是的，可只有一点儿像。”然后他们三人接着聊天。卡登一边装着看报纸一边仔细听着。</p>
<p>'Madame is right, 'said Jacques Three. 'Why should we stop at Evr&eacute;monde? '</p>
<p>“夫人是对的，”雅克第三说。“我们为什么要在埃弗蒙这儿就打住呢? ”</p>
<p>'We must stop somewhere, said Defarge.</p>
<p>“我们必须适可而止。”得法热说。</p>
<p>'Not until they are all dead, every one of that family, 'said his wife.</p>
<p>“在他们，包括那个家族里的每一个人都死掉之前，我们不能就这样打祝”他妻子说。</p>
<p>'You're right, but think how much the Doctor has suffered. Perhaps he has suffered enough. '</p>
<p>“你是对的，但是想一想医生受了多少苦，也许他已经受够了。”</p>
<p>'Listen, 'said Madame Defarge coldly. 'Don't forget that I was that younger sister. And it was my family that suffered so much from the Evr&eacute;monde brothers. It was my sister who died, and my sister's husband, and my father；it was my brother who was killed. Tell others to stop；don't tell me！'</p>
<p>“听着，”得法热夫人冷酷地说。“别忘了我就是那个小妹妹，并且是我的家庭受了埃弗蒙兄弟那么多的苦难。是我的姐姐死去了，还有我姐姐的丈夫，以及我的父亲；是我的哥哥被杀死了。去让别人打住吧，别让我这么做！”</p>
<p>Carton paid for his wine and went out quickly on his way. He went back to Dr Manette's house, where more bad news was waiting for him. The Doctor's mind had returned to the past once again. He did not recognize his friends, and wanted only to find his old table and to make shoes.</p>
<p>卡登付了酒钱便匆匆出门上了路。他回到了马内特医生的住处。那里有更多的坏消息在等着他。医生的思维又一次回到了从前。他不认识他的朋友了，而只想着要找他的老桌子做鞋。</p>
<p>'Listen to me carefully, 'Carton said to Mr Lorry. 'I believe that Lucie, her daughter, and perhaps even her father are in great danger. I heard Madame Defange talking about them tonight. They must leave Paris tomorrow. They have the necessary papers, and so do you. Here are mine－take them and keep them safe with your own. You must leave by coach at two o'clock tomorrow. Keep a place for me in the coach, and don't leave without me. Promise that you will do exactly what I have said. Many lives will depend on it. '</p>
<p>“仔细听我说，”卡登对劳里先生说。“我确信路茜、她的女儿，也许还有她的父亲都处在极大的危险中。我今晚听到得法热夫人在谈论他们。他们明天必须离开巴黎。他们有必需的证件，你也有。这是我的证件——把它们拿去同你的放在一起妥善保管。你们必须在明天两点钟乘马车离开。在马车上给我留个位置，要等我来了再走。你一定要完全照我说的去做；保全许多人的生命就在此一举了。”</p>
<p>'I promise, 'said Mr Lorry.</p>
<p>“我答应你。”劳里先生说道。</p><a href='12.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
