<p>While Dorian was having breakfast the next morning，Basil Hallward came to see him．</p>
<p>第二天早晨多里安正在吃早餐，巴兹尔&middot;霍尔沃德前来看望他。</p>
<p>'At last I've found you，Dorian，'he said seriously．'I came last night， but they told me that you'd gone out to dinner with friends．I knew that wasn't true，of course．I wanted to tell you how sorry I was about Sybil Vane．Poor girl！'</p>
<p>“我终于找到你了，多里安。”他严肃地说，“我昨晚来过，但他们告诉我你和朋友出去吃饭了。我知道那当然不是真的。我想告诉你我是多么地为西比尔&middot;文难过，可怜的姑娘！”</p>
<p>'My dear Basil，'said Dorian．He looked bored．'I was at Lord Henry's house last night．It was a very amusing evening．'</p>
<p>“亲爱的巴兹尔，”多里安说，他显得不耐烦，“昨晚我在亨利勋爵家，那是个很有趣的夜晚。”</p>
<p>Basil stared at him．'You went out to dinner？'he said slowly．'You went out to dinner when Sybil Vane was lying dead in some dirty theatre？'</p>
<p>巴兹尔盯着他。“你出去吃晚饭了？”他缓慢地说，“西比文&middot;文的尸体还躺在某个肮脏的剧院时你居然外出吃晚饭？”</p>
<p>'Stop，Basil！I won't listen to you！'Dorian jumped to his feet．'Sybil Vane is in the past… finished… forgotten．'</p>
<p>“别说了，巴兹尔！我不想听你说！”多里安站了起来。“西比尔&middot;文已成为过去……都结束了……忘却了。”</p>
<p>'You've changed，Dorian，'said Basil．'You have the same wonderful face， but where is the kind and gentle boy who sat for my portrait？ Have you no heart？'</p>
<p>“你变了，多里安。”巴兹尔说，“你还是长着同样漂亮的面孔，但是那个坐着让我画像的和善、温柔的男孩哪儿去了？你没有心了吗？”</p>
<p>'Yesterday my heart was full of sadness．I have cried for Sybil，yes，but I cannot cry today．I have changed， Basil．I'm a man now，with new feelings，new ideas． Don't be angry with me．I am what I am．There's nothing more to say．'</p>
<p>“昨天我的心充满了悲伤，我曾为西比尔哭泣。但我今天不会哭，我已经变了，巴兹尔。我现在是一个男人了，有了新感情、新思想。别生我的气，我就这样了，再没什么可说的了。”</p>
<p>Basil watched him sadly．'Well， Dorian，'he said at last，'I won't speak of poor Sybil again．But will you come and sit for another portrait soon？'</p>
<p>巴兹尔难过地注视他。“好吧，多里安，”他终于说，“我再不说可怜的西比尔了。可你能尽快来我这儿让我再给你画一幅画像吗？”</p>
<p>'No．Never，'said Dorian quickly．'It's impossible．'</p>
<p>“不，决不。”多里安很快回答。“不可能。”</p>
<p>'But why？'asked Basil，very surprised．'And why have you covered the portrait？'He walked across the room towards the painting．</p>
<p>“为什么？”巴兹尔非常吃惊地问，“你为什么遮住画像？”他穿过房间朝画像走去。</p>
<p>Dorian cried out in fear， and ran between Basil and the portrait．'No，Basil！You must not look at it．I don't want you to see it．'His face was white and angry．'If you try to look at it，I'll never speak to you again．'</p>
<p>多里安恐惧地喊起来，冲过去挡在巴兹尔和画像之间。“不，巴兹尔！你不能看，我不想让你看。”他的脸又苍白又愤怒。“如果你非要看它，我就再不和你说话了。”</p>
<p>The artist stared at him．'Why can't I look at my own work？'he asked．'I'm going to exhibit it in an art gallery in Paris soon．'</p>
<p>画家盯着他，“为什么我不能看我自己的作品？”他问。“我将在巴黎的一个画廊展出这幅画像。”</p>
<p>Dorian tried to hide his fear．'But you said…you told me that you would never exhibit the picture． Why have you changed your mind？'He came closer to Basil and looked into his face．'Tell me why，'he said．</p>
<p>多里安努力掩藏着他的恐惧。“可是你说过……你告诉过我你决不会展出这幅画像。你为什么改变了主意？”他走近巴兹尔，观察他的脸。“告诉我为什么。”他说。</p>
<p>Basil turned away． After a while he said slowly，'I see that you too have noticed something strange about the picture．Dorian， you changed my life as an artist from the moment when I met you．You became very important to me—I could not stop thinking about you．And when I painted this portrait，I felt that I'd put too much of myself into it． I could not let other people see it．'He was silent for a moment， then turned back to Dorian．'Perhaps you're right．I cannot exhibit this picture．But will you let me look at it again？'</p>
<p>巴兹尔转身走开。过了一会儿他缓慢地说：“我看得出你也注意到了画像有点奇怪。多里安，从我见到你开始，你改变了我作为画家的生活。你变得对我很重要——我无法不想着你。画这幅画像时，我感觉我画进了我自己太多的东西，我不能让其他人看它。”他沉默片刻，然后转向多里安：“可能你是对的，我不能展出这幅画。但你能让我再看一眼吗？”</p>
<p>'No，never！'</p>
<p>“不，决不！”</p>
<p>The artist smiled sadly．'Well，I've told you my secret now．Try to understand me，Dorian．You've been the one person in my life who has really influenced my art．'</p>
<p>画家难过地一笑：“唉，我已经告诉了你我的秘密，尽量理解我，多里安，你是我一生中唯一真正影响我的艺术的人。”</p>
<p>As he left the room，Dorian Gray smiled to himself．What a dangerous moment that had been！ Poor Basil！Although he had told his own secret， he had not discovered Dorian's secret．But the picture…he must hide it away at once．No one must ever see it again．</p>
<p>巴兹尔离开房间后，多里安&middot;格雷对自己一笑，刚才多危险啊！可怜的巴兹尔！虽然他讲出了他的秘密，但他并没发现多里安的秘密。可这画像……他必须立刻将它藏起来，没人能再看到它。</p>
<p>He had the covered portrait carried upstairs to a small room at the top of the house． Then he locked the door and kept the key himself． He felt safe now， because only his eyes would see the terrible changes in that beautiful face．</p>
<p>他叫人把遮着的画像搬上楼放在房子顶部的一个小房间里，然后锁上门，钥匙由自己亲自掌管。现在他觉得安全了，因为只有他自己的眼睛可以目睹那张漂亮的脸上发生的可怕的变化。</p>
<p>When he returned to the room downstairs，he picked up a book that Lord Henry had lent him． He sat down and began to read．</p>
<p>回到楼下的房间，他拿起一本亨利勋爵借给他的书，坐下开始<a href="http://www.tingvoa.com/English_News/" target="_blank" class="infotextkey">阅读</a>。</p>
<p>It was the story of a Frenchman， who had spent his life searching for beauty and pleasure—pleasure of all kinds，both good and bad． Dorian read for hours．It was a frightening book，full of strange ideas and dangerous dreams—dreams that slowly became real for Dorian．</p>
<p>书讲述的是一个法国人的故事，他用一生的时间追寻美貌和享受——各种各样的享受，有好的有坏的。多里安读了几个小时。这是一本可怕的书，充满了古怪的念头和危险的梦想——这些梦想逐渐变成了多里安真实的东西。</p>
<p>Dorian read this book many times．In fact， he could not stop reading it，and over the years，it became more and more interesting to him．He felt that the Frenchman's life was a mirror of his own．</p>
<p>这本书多里安读了许多遍。实际上，他止不住地一直在读这本书。过了几年，他越来越觉得这本书有意思，他觉得这个法国人的生活就像自己生活的真实写照。</p><a href='11.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
