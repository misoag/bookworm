<p><b>14 水手-“我要找到那个人，像杀死一条狗那样杀死他。” </b></p>
<p>Later the same evening Dorian Gray was at a party．He smiled and talked，and looked as young and as good-looking as ever． But his head ached and at dinner he could not eat anything．When Lord Henry asked him if he felt unwell，Dorian said that he was tired and would go home early．</p>
<p>过后，还是在同一天晚上，多里安&middot;格雷参加了一个聚会。他谈笑着，像以前一样年轻英浚可是他头疼，晚餐时吃不下任何东西。亨利勋爵问他是否不舒服时，多里安说他累了，要早点回家。</p>
<p>At home he felt worse． Although the room was warm， his hands shook with cold． He wanted to forget for a while—to escape from the prison of his real life， and to lose himself in dreams．</p>
<p>回家后他觉得更糟。虽然房间里挺暖和，但是他的双手冷得发抖。他想暂时忘记——从他真实生活的牢狱中逃脱出来，在梦想中放松自己。</p>
<p>At midnight， in old dirty clothes， he left the house again and went to the East End of London．There he knew places where he could get opium—dark，evil places where people bought and sold the beautiful， terrible dreams of opium．He had been there many times before．</p>
<p>午夜，穿上脏旧的衣服他再次离开家前往伦敦东区。在那儿他知道从什么地方能搞到鸦片——在那些黑暗、邪恶的地方，人们买卖着鸦片，这种东西让人产生美丽而又可怕的幻觉。他去过那儿很多次。</p>
<p>He found the house that he was looking for and went into a long，low room．Men were lying on the dirty floor，a sailor was asleep on a table and two women were drinking at the bar． As Dorian hurried up the narrow stairs，the sweet， heavy smell of opium came to meet him and he smiled in pleasure．But in the room he saw a young man who had once been his friend． He turned away， and went downstairs again to drink at the bar．</p>
<p>他找到了要找的房子，进入了一间又长又矮的屋子。男人们躺在肮脏的地上，一个水手趴在桌子上睡觉，两个女人在酒吧喝酒。多里安在狭窄的楼梯上快步向上爬时，他闻到了鸦片甜美、浓厚的气味。他快活地笑了。但是在房间里他看见了一个曾是他朋友的年轻人。他转回身，又回到楼下，在酒吧喝酒。</p>
<p>One of the women spoke to him．</p>
<p>有一个女人跟他讲话。</p>
<p>'Don't talk to me，'said Dorian angrily， and walked towards the door．</p>
<p>“别跟我说话。”多里安生气地说，然后走向房门。</p>
<p>'I remember you！You're Prince Charming，aren't you？'she shouted after him．</p>
<p>“我记得你！你是'迷人的王子'，对吗？”她追着他喊。</p>
<p>The sleeping sailor woke up when he heard these words，and as Dorian left the house， the sailor hurried after him．</p>
<p>听见这些话，睡觉的水手醒了。多里安离开房间时，水手在后面紧追不舍。</p>
<p>Dorian walked quickly along the road，but as he reached a corner，hands closed around his neck． A man pulled him backwards and pushed him against a wall．Dorian fought wildly， and pulled the hands away． Then he saw the gun in the man's hand．</p>
<p>多里安在路上走得很快。到了一个角落时，一双手掐住了他的脖子。一个男人将他向后一拉又把他推撞到墙上。多里安拼命地挣扎，拉开了那双手，然后他看见了这个男人手里的枪。</p>
<p>'What do you want？'he said quickly．</p>
<p>“你要干什么？”他急速地问。</p>
<p>'Keep quiet，'said the man．'If you move，I'll shoot you．'</p>
<p>“住嘴。”男人说，“如果你动一下，我就打死你。”</p>
<p>'You're crazy． What have I done to you？'</p>
<p>“你疯了，我怎么着你了？”</p>
<p>'You destroyed the life of Sybil Vane，'answered the sailor，'and Sybil Vane was my sister．She killed herself because of you．I've been looking for you for years， but I only knew the name that she used to call you—Prince Charming．Well，tonight I heard your name，and tonight you're going to die．'</p>
<p>“你毁了西比尔&middot;文。”水手回答，“西比尔&middot;文是我妹妹，她自杀是因为你。这么多年我一直在找你，可我只知道她常叫的你的名字——'迷人的王子'。好了，今晚我听见了你的名字，今晚你就得去死。”</p>
<p>Dorian Gray grew sick with fear．'I never knew her． I've never heard of her．You're crazy，'he cried．Suddenly he had an idea．'How long ago did your sister die？' he asked．</p>
<p>多里安&middot;格雷怕得要命。“我从不认识她，我从没听说过她，你疯了。”他喊着。突然他有了一个主意。“你妹妹是多长时间以前死的？”他问。</p>
<p>'Eighteen years ago，'James Vane replied．'Why do you ask me？'</p>
<p>“18年前。”詹姆斯回答。“你为什么问我？”</p>
<p>'Eighteen years，'laughed Dorian Gray．'Take me to the light and look at my face．'</p>
<p>“18年前。”多里安笑了。“把我带到灯光下，看看我的脸。”</p>
<p>James Vane stared at Dorian．Then he pushed him towards the light，and in the light he saw the face of a boy of twenty．This man was too young． He was not the man who had destroyed his sister's life．</p>
<p>詹姆斯&middot;文凝视着多里安的脸，然后把他推到光亮处。在灯光里他看见了一个20岁男孩的脸。这个人太年轻了，他不是毁掉妹妹生活的人。</p>
<p>'My God！'he cried．'I nearly murdered you！'</p>
<p>“上帝！”他喊道。“我差点杀了你！”</p>
<p>'Go home，and put that gun away， before you get into trouble，'said Dorian．And he walked quickly away．</p>
<p>“回家去，把那枪拿开，趁你还没惹麻烦。”多里安说，然后迅速走开了。</p>
<p>James Vane stared after him in horror．Then a woman's hand touched his arm．</p>
<p>詹姆斯&middot;文在他身后恐惧地瞪着眼，一个女人的手碰了碰他的胳膊。</p>
<p>'Why didn't you kill him？'she asked．'He's evil．'</p>
<p>“你为什么不杀他？”她问。“他不是好东西。”</p>
<p>'He's not the man that I'm looking for，'answered the sailor．'The man who I want must be nearly forty now． That man is only a boy．'</p>
<p>“他不是我要找的人。”水手回答，“我找的人现在应该将近四十岁了，那个人只是个男孩。”</p>
<p>'A boy？'The woman laughed．Her voice was hard．'It's eighteen years since I met Prince Charming． And his pretty face hasn't changed in all that time．It's true，I promise you．'</p>
<p>“男孩？”女人笑了。她的话音很严肃，“我认识'迷人的王子'18年了，这期间他漂亮的脸一点没变，这是真的，我向你发誓。”</p>
<p>James Vane ran to the corner of the road， but Dorian Gray had disappeared．</p>
<p>詹姆斯&middot;文跑到路的拐角，但是多里安已经不见了。</p><a href='15.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
