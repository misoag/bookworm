<p><b>1 来到英格兰 </b></p>
<p>My name is Carol Sanders．</p>
<p>我叫卡罗尔&middot;桑德斯。</p>
<p>I live in England now，but when I was younger，I lived in Hong Kong．My father was a businessman there and my mother worked as a secretary．We lived in Hong Kong for seven years．</p>
<p>我现居英格兰，但我更年轻时住在香港。我父亲在那儿经商而我母亲是个秘书。我们在香港住了七年。</p>
<p>I was happy at school， with lots of friends，and we had a good time．I liked pop music—the Rolling Stones，David Bowie and Jake Rosso were my favourites．</p>
<p>我在学校很快乐，有许多朋友；我们玩得很愉快。我喜欢流行音乐——滚石乐队、戴维&middot;鲍伊和杰克&middot;罗素是我至爱。</p>
<p>Jake Rosso was my favourite singer． He died in a car accident the year I left school， but I listened to his pop records all the time．I had hundreds of pictures and photos of him on my bedroom wall．</p>
<p>杰克&middot;罗索是我最喜欢的歌手。我离校那年他死于一次车祸，但我一直在听他的流行歌曲唱片。我在我卧室的墙上贴了成百上千的有关他的画片和照片。</p>
<p>Then one day in winter when I was seventeen，things began to go wrong for me．</p>
<p>接着在我17岁那年冬季的一天，事情对我来说开始变糟了。</p>
<p>My father went to Australia on business．I loved him very much and didn't like him going away．</p>
<p>我父亲去澳大利亚出差。我非常爱他，不愿意让他离家在外。</p>
<p>‘Come home quickly，’I always said to him．</p>
<p>“快点回家来，”我总是对他说。</p>
<p>He was in Australia for two weeks．Then， on the day of his journey home， an aeroplane from Sydney crashed into the sea just south of Hong Kong．Everybody on the plane died．</p>
<p>他在澳大利亚呆了两周。接着，在他要登上回程的那天，一架从悉尼起飞的飞机坠入香港正南部的海域。机上人员全部遇难。</p>
<p>I heard about the plane crash on television．At first， I did not think about my father．Then I remembered he was flying back from Sydney on that day．</p>
<p>我从电视上听到飞机失事的消息。起初，我并没有想到我父亲。后来，我想起来那天他正从悉尼乘机返回。</p>
<p>‘Oh，no！’I cried．</p>
<p>“啊，不！”我叫了起来。</p>
<p>I telephoned the airport but they did not know the names of all the passengers then．</p>
<p>我给机场打电话，但他们那时还不知道所有乘客的名字。</p>
<p>‘Perhaps my father didn't get that plane，’I thought．‘ Oh，please！Please！’</p>
<p>“或许我父亲没乘那架飞机。”我想，“啊，千万别乘！千万别乘那架飞机！”</p>
<p>My mother was at work and I called her on the telephone．She came home quickly and we went to the airport and waited for news．</p>
<p>我母亲当时正在上班，于是我给她打了电话。她很快回家；我们去机场并等待消息。</p>
<p>Later，we learned my father was on the plane．</p>
<p>后来，我们得知我父亲正在那架飞机上。</p>
<p>‘It's not true！’I shouted．</p>
<p>“这不是真的！”我喊道。</p>
<p>But it was true， and I began to cry．</p>
<p>但这是真的，我哭了起来。</p>
<p>I cried for weeks and weeks．I spent many days alone in my room．I was lonely and sad and I wanted to die，too．</p>
<p>我哭了一周又一周。好多天我独自一人呆在房间里。我既孤独又伤心，我也想过去死。</p>
<p>I stopped going out with my friends． I didn't want to see other people．I stopped listening to Jake Rosso's records， and took his pictures off my bedroom wall． I didn't listen to music or watch television． Nothing mattered any more．</p>
<p>我不再和朋友们出去玩了。我不想见别人。我不再听杰克&middot;罗索的唱片了，还把他的图片从我卧室的墙上取了下来。我不听音乐了，也不看电视了。一切对我都不再要紧了。</p>
<p>Then I stopped crying．I stopped feeling sad and began to feel angry．</p>
<p>后来我不哭了。我不再伤心了，而开始感到愤怒了。</p>
<p>‘Why did it happen to him？’I asked my mother．‘Why do the best people die？Jake Rosso．My father．’</p>
<p>“为什么这事让他碰上了呢？”我问妈妈，“为什么总是最好的人死呢？杰克&middot;罗索。我爸爸。”</p>
<p>‘I… I don't know， Carol，'my mother said．She was unhappy，too．</p>
<p>“我……我不知道，卡罗尔。”我妈妈说。她也不愉快。</p>
<p>At the time of the plane crash， I was a student at college．I enjoyed the college work and life very much， but after my father's death I stopped doing my work at the college．I began to go out with some new friends．They were different from my other friends，and my mother didn't like them．</p>
<p>飞机失事的时候，我正是个大学学生。我当时很喜欢大学的学习和生活，但我父亲去世后我在大学不学习了。我开始和一些新结识的朋友出去玩。他们和我的其他朋友不一样，而且我妈妈不喜欢他们。</p>
<p>‘ They're bad people，Carol，'she told me．‘They do dangerous things．’</p>
<p>“他们不是正经人，卡罗尔。”她告诉我，“他们在干一些危险的事情。”</p>
<p>‘They're exciting，’I said．‘And I like them．’</p>
<p>“他们令人感到兴奋。”我说，“而且我喜欢他们。”</p>
<p>I knew she was angry but I didn't care． But then I learned my new friends took drugs，and I began to take drugs，too．It was wrong and stupid，I know that now， but I was unhappy and angry．</p>
<p>我知道她生气了，可我不在乎。后来我得知我新结识的朋友们在吸毒，我也开始吸毒了。我现在知道那样做既错又蠢，可那时候我心情郁闷。</p>
<p>The police came to the college to arrest some of the students．They didn't arrest me， but I had to leave the college．It was a bad time．</p>
<p>警察来到大学抓了一些学生。他们没抓我，可我不得不离开那个大学。那段日子可真糟糕。</p>
<p>My mother was very unhappy with me．‘What am I going to do with you，Carol？ she said．</p>
<p>我妈妈对我很不高兴。“我拿你可怎么办呢，卡罗尔？”她说。</p>
<p>‘I'm sorry，’I told her．</p>
<p>“对不起，”我告诉她说。</p>
<p>‘We'll go back to England，'she said．‘You can find a college there．Perhaps you can be happier in England．’</p>
<p>“我们回英格兰吧。”她说，“在那儿你可以找所大学上。在英格兰也许你会高兴些。”</p>
<p>‘All right，’I said．‘I want to forget what's happened．I want to forget what I've done and begin a new life， be a new person．’</p>
<p>“好吧。”我说，“我想把过去发生的事忘掉。我想把我所干的事忘掉，开始新生活，成为一个新人。”</p>
<p>A month later， we came back to England．We lived in London，in a hotel．It was strange，at first， with all the red buses and everybody speaking English．It was the beginning of the summer，three months before college began in the autumn．London was full of tourists．</p>
<p>一个月后，我们回到了英格兰。我们住在伦敦，呆在一家饭店里。起初，一切都很新奇：公共汽车是红色的，人人都说英语。时值初夏，离秋季开学还有三个月。伦敦到处都是观光客。</p>
<p>We looked at all the famous buildings—Buckingham Palace，the Tower of London．And we went to restaurants and theatres in the evenings．It was interesting and exciting and I began to forget the bad times in Hong Kong．</p>
<p>我们参观了所有著名的建筑物——白金汉宫、伦敦塔。而且晚上我们去餐馆和剧院。这令人感兴趣、令人激动，我开始忘掉在香港的那些令人难受的时光。</p>
<p>‘I'm pleased we came to London，’I told my mother．</p>
<p>“我真为我们来到了伦敦而高兴，”我对妈妈说。</p>
<p>But after a few weeks，she said，‘You need to find a college，Carol．You must go on studying． And I need a job．’</p>
<p>但是过了几周之后，她说：“你得找所大学上，卡罗尔。你必须继续你的学业。我也需要个工作。”</p>
<p>That evening， we looked in the newspapers．</p>
<p>那天傍晚，我们翻看了一下报纸。</p>
<p>‘What about this？’I said．I showed my mother a job in the newspaper．</p>
<p>“这工作怎么样？”我说。我给妈妈看了看报上登的一条招工的消息。</p>

<p>招聘秘书启事</p>
<p>for the summer months</p>

<p>on a small private island in Scotland．</p>

<p>for the right person．</p>
<p>工作有趣，薪金丰厚。</p>

<p>有意者请与格里塔&middot;罗斯联系。电话：071……</p>
<p>‘Well， that sounds interesting，'said my mother．‘I'd like to work as a secretary on an island in Scotland．It's a beautiful country， Carol， and you can go to a college there in the autumn．’</p>
<p>“嗯，听起来挺有意思的。”我妈妈说，“我愿意在苏格兰的一个岛上干秘书工作。它是个很美丽的地方，卡罗尔，而且你秋季可以在那儿上大学。”</p>
<p>‘And it's a place to live for the summer，’I said．‘Hotels are expensive．’</p>
<p>“夏季也可以在那儿过。”我说，“饭店很费钱。”</p>

<p>我和妈妈一起去了萨沃伊饭店。这个饭店既大又贵，比我们住的饭店大，并位于伦敦的中心地带。</p>
<p>‘Mum needs this job，I thought．‘And a private island in Scotland is a nice place to live．Perhaps I can forget what's happened if I go there．’</p>
<p>“妈妈需要这个工作。”我想，“苏格兰的一座私人岛屿还是个生活的好地方。我如果去那儿，也许就可以把过去发生的事情忘掉。”</p>

<p>“22号房间。”饭店服务台的女士说，“上楼去吧。罗斯夫人现在就可以接见您。”</p>

<p>“您好，”我说。</p>
<p>‘Carol is eighteen years old，'said my mother．‘Can she come with me，if I get the job？ Perhaps she can help in the house or in the garden．She likes gardening．She's studying farming at college．’</p>
<p>“卡罗尔18岁了。”我妈妈说，“如果我能得到这份工作，她可以跟着我吗？也许她能帮助做些家务活或干些园子里的活。她喜欢园艺。她正在大学学农业。”</p>
<p>‘Perhaps， said Greta Ross．‘There's a small farm on the island．’</p>
<p>“也许行吧。”格里塔&middot;罗斯说，“岛上有个小农常”</p>
<p>‘I'd like to work on the farm，’I said．</p>
<p>“我喜欢在农场里干活，”我说。</p>
<p>Greta Ross looked at my mother．‘How long did you live in Hong Kong，Mrs Sanders？’</p>
<p>格里塔&middot;罗斯看了看我母亲。“你们在香港住了多久，桑德斯夫人？”</p>
<p>‘Seven years，’answered my mother．‘My husband died in a plane crash last year，so we've come back to live in England．’</p>
<p>“七年。”我妈妈说，“我丈夫去年因飞机失事去世了，所以我们回英格兰住来了。”</p>

<p>“我们在印度住了三年。”</p>
<p>Then Greta Ross took my mother into a room and asked her more questions．I waited outside．</p>
<p>然后格里塔&middot;罗斯带我妈妈进了一个房间，问了她更多的问题。我在外边等着。</p>
<p>‘Greta Ross is nice，’I thought．‘I hope my mother gets the job．’</p>

<p>Soon after，the door opened and my mother came out．She was smiling．</p>
<p>过了不一会儿门开了，我妈妈出来了。她微笑着。</p>

<p>格里塔&middot;罗斯说：“请在这儿等一会儿，桑德斯夫人。我想去打个电话。”她返回房间，并关上了门。</p>
<p>I was sitting on a chair near the door，and I could just hear Greta Ross's voice speaking on the phone．</p>
<p>我坐在门旁的一把椅子上，正好能听到格里塔&middot;罗斯打电话的声音。</p>
<p>‘I think I've found someone，'she was saying．‘She has a daughter，but the girl can work in the garden or on the farm… Don't worry，they've been away from England for ten years… It'll be all right，I tell you… Don't worry．’</p>
<p>“我想我已经找到了一个人。”她正在说，“她有个女儿，但这个女孩可以在园子或在农场干些活儿……别担心，她们离开英格兰已有10年了……不会出事的，我告诉你……别担心。”</p>
<p>After a few minutes， Greta Ross put down the phone and came ont of the room．</p>
<p>过了一会儿，格里塔&middot;罗斯挂上了电话并从屋里出来了。</p>
