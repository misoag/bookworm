<p>Isat in my dark hut， and felt both angry and sad． One half of me wanted to hurt the people who had hurt me．The other half of me still loved them． In the end I decided to try to speak to the old man again． I fell into an unhappy sleep，but when I woke in the morning， the family had gone． They had left the house during the night．</p>
<p>我坐在黑暗的小茅屋里，感到既愤怒又悲伤。我一方面想去伤害那些伤害过我的人，另一方面却又仍然爱着他们。最后我决定再去试着同那个老人谈一谈。我躺倒后伤心地睡着了，在早上醒来时却发现那家人已经走了。他们是在夜里离开的。</p>
<p>I knew the name of only one other person． Although I had seen you， Frankenstein， for only a few moments， I knew that I belonged to you．When I had left your house，I had picked up a small bag． There was a book in the bag， and I could now read it． From it I learnt my creator's name and address．You had made me， but why had you not looked after me， and saved me from this pain and unhappiness？ I decided to go to Geneva， to find you．</p>
<p>我当时只知道另外一个人的名字。弗兰肯斯坦，尽管当时我只见到你一会儿工夫，但我知道我是属于你的。在我离开你的房子时，我曾捡起过一个小包。包里有一本书，现在我能读懂它了。我从中了解到创造我的人的姓名和地址。你造了我，但为什么你没有照料我并把我从这样的痛苦和伤心之中拯救出来呢？我决心去日内瓦找你。</p>
<p>One day as I was travelling， I saw a young girl running along the side of a river． Suddenly she fell into the water．I jumped into the river， fought against the fast－moving water，and brought her back to land． While I was doing this， the girl's father， who was looking for her， reached us．He was carrying a gun，and when he saw me，he fired．The bullet hit my arm and broke it． I fell to the ground in great pain， and the man and the girl ran into the woods as fast as they could，and left me．</p>
<p>一天，在旅行时，我看见有个小女孩正沿着河边跑。她突然掉到了水里。我跳到水里同激流搏斗，把她带到了岸上。在我做这件事时，女孩的父亲来到了我们身边，他正在寻找她。他带着一把枪，在看到我后便开了枪。子弹打中了我的胳膊并打断了它。我带着巨大的疼痛倒在了地上，而那个男人和那个女孩则以最快的速度跑进了树林，把我撇在了一边。</p>
<p>The bullet was deep in my arm， and I lost a lot of blood．After some days my arm began to get better， but I became sadder and angrier than before． I had saved the girl's life， and how did they thank me？ With a bullet in the arm！I began to realize that there was no happiness for me in life． Hate grew stronger in me every day ．Hate for you， my creator， who had made me．</p>
<p>子弹在我的胳膊中打得很深，我失了很多血。几天后我的胳膊开始好起来，但我比以前更伤心、更愤怒了。我救了那个女孩的命，他们是怎么感谢我的呢？用一颗子弹射进我的胳膊里！我开始认识到我的生命中没有幸福可言。我心中的仇恨一天比一天强烈。这仇恨是针对你、我的创造者的。</p>
<p>Two months later， I reached Geneva． That evening I hid among some trees outside the town， and went to sleep． But I woke when a little boy ran into my hiding place． I thought I would catch the child and make him my friend before he was old enough to be frightened of my terrible face．I caught the little boy， but when the child saw me， he covered his eyes with his hands and screamed loudly．</p>
<p>两个月后，我到了日内瓦。那天晚上我躲到城外的几棵树中间并且睡着了。但是在我醒来时有个小孩跑到了我躲藏的地方。我想我可以抓住那个小孩以便在他长大到害怕我那令人恐怖的脸之前同他交个朋友。我抓住了那个小男孩，但当那个孩子看到我时，他用双手捂住了脸并大声尖叫了起来。</p>
<p>‘Let me go， you monster，’the child shouted．‘Let me go，or I will tell my father， Mr Frankenstein．He will call the police，and they'll punish you．’</p>
<p>“放开我，你这个怪物。”那个孩子嚷道，“放开我，不然我就要告诉我父亲弗兰肯斯坦先生了。他会叫警察来，而且他们会惩罚你的。”</p>
<p>‘Frankenstein！’I shouted．‘You belong to my enemy， the man that I want to hurt．’</p>
<p>“弗兰肯斯坦！”我大喊道，“你属于我的敌人，我想要伤害的那个男人。”</p>
<p>The child fought and screamed， and I put my hand round his neck to stop him shouting．In a moment， the child lay dead at my feet．I looked down at his body， and was pleased with what I had done． I knew that the death of this child would hurt you，Victor Frankenstein，my creator．</p>
<p>那个小孩一边搏斗一边叫喊，我于是用手卡住他的脖子以阻止他叫喊。过了一会儿，那个孩子便倒在我的脚下死了。我俯视着他的尸体，对我所做的事感到高兴。我知道这个孩子的死会伤害你，维克多&middot;弗兰肯斯坦，我的创造者。</p>
<p>Then I saw something bright round the child's neck． It was a gold chain，and on the end of it was a picture of a very beau－tiful woman．I knew that a beautiful woman would never smile at me， and I wanted to run into Geneva and kill as many people as I could．But I stopped myself，and went to look for an-other hiding place．Soon I found a hut， which seemed to be empty，but when I entered I saw a pretty young woman asleep on the floor． I hated her because she was pretty．So I put the gold chain into one of her pockets， and then， before she could wake up， I ran away．I knew the police would think that she had killed the little boy．</p>
<p>后来我看见孩子的脖子上有个亮闪闪的东西。那是一条金链，它的末端有一张非常漂亮的女人的照片。我知道漂亮女人是绝不会朝我微笑的，于是便想跑到日内瓦去尽量多杀死几个人。然而我阻止了自己的行动，并去找别的躲藏之处。不久我发现了一个茅屋，它似乎是空的；但当我进去后便见到一个年轻漂亮的女人熟睡在地板上。我恨她就因为她漂亮。于是我把那条金链放到了她的一个口袋中，然后在她醒来之前跑开了。我知道警察会认为是她杀死了那个小男孩的。</p><a href='10.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
