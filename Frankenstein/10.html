<p><b>10 维克多&middot;弗兰肯斯坦继续讲他的故事 </b></p>
<p>The monster finished telling me his story， and then he said：</p>
<p>怪物讲完了他的故事，然后说道：</p>
<p>‘I am alone and miserable． Only someone as ugly as I am could love me．You must make another creature like me， a woman monster to be my wife．’</p>
<p>“我孤独而凄惨。只有某个像我一样丑的人才会爱我的。你必须另外造像我这样的一个女怪物来当我的妻子。”</p>
<p>‘I shall never make another creature like you，’I shouted ‘You have done enough evil on your own．’</p>
<p>“我决不会再造一个像你一样的人的，”我喊道，“你自己已经干够了邪恶的事情了。”</p>
<p>‘If you don't help me，I shall make you more miserable than you have ever been in your life．You will wish you were dead，’the monster said．‘But if you make another monster to be my friend， we won't hurt anyone．Be kind to me now，and I will learn to love and be kind．’</p>
<p>“如果你不帮我，那么我就会让你过得比你以往任何时候都要凄惨。你会求死不得的，”怪物说，“但是如果你另外造一个怪物当我的朋友，那么我们就不会伤害任何人。现在善待我吧，我也会学着去爱人并变得善良的。”</p>
<p>I thought long and hard about the monster's words．I felt sorry for him．He was so miserable．Perhaps I should help him．</p>
<p>怪物的话让我费力地考虑了很久。我感到对不起他，他是如此痛苦。或许我应该帮助他。</p>
<p>‘I shall do what you ask，’I told him．‘But you must promise to live somewhere in the world where nobody lives．You must promise to stay away from other people．’</p>
<p>“我会照你说的去做，”我对他说道，“但你得答应要呆在没人生活的地方。”</p>
<p>‘I promise！I promise！he cried．‘Please start your work．I shall watch you，and when you are ready，you can be sure I will come back．’ He turned and left me，and ran down the mountain．</p>
<p>“我答应！我答应！”他喊道，“请你开始工作吧。我会监视你的；在你准备好了以后，你可以肯定我会回来的。”他转身离开了我，并跑下了山。</p>
<p>I went back to Geneva immediately．My family were very worried when they saw me．I was pale and my eyes were wild．I could not forget my promise to the monster， and the awful work that waited for me． But I had to do it．It was the only way to keep my family safe… safe from his murdering hands around their necks．</p>
<p>我立即返回日内瓦。我家人见到我时都非常为我担忧。我脸色苍白，眼睛发狂。我忘不了我对怪物的允诺，还有那等着我的可怕的工作。但我必须去做。那是保证我家庭平安的唯一出路……使他们不致被怪物的手扼死。</p>
<p>I needed to study for several months to make a woman monster successfully．I heard that an English scientist had done some useful work，so I decided to go to England．</p>
<p>为了成功地造一个女怪物我需要几个月的时间进行研究。我了解到有个英国科学家已进行了一些有价值的工作，于是决定去英国。</p>
<p>Before I went， my father asked me：‘Are you going to marry Elizabeth，or do you love another woman？Is this why you are so unhappy？’</p>
<p>在我去之前，我父亲问我：“你是打算娶伊丽莎白，还是爱上了另外一个女人？你是不是因为这个而如此不高兴？”</p>
<p>‘No， father，’I replied．‘I have always loved Elizabeth，and I want to marry her．But I must do one more piece of scientific work before we can marry．I must go to England to do the work and I want to marry Elizabeth when I return．’</p>
<p>“不是，爸爸。”我回答道，“我一直都爱伊丽莎白，并且我要娶她。但是在我们结婚之前我必须再进行一项科学工作。我必须去英国做那项工作而在回来后便同伊丽莎白结婚。”</p>
<p>My father and Elizabeth did not want me to go to England alone，because I had been so ill．They spoke to my old friend Henry Clerval，and he was very happy to travel with me．I was pleased that he could come，although I did not want him to discover anything about my horrible work．</p>
<p>我父亲和伊丽莎白不想让我单独去英国，因为我一直生玻他们对我的老朋友亨利&middot;克勒沃讲了，而他非常高兴同我一起去。他能去我很高兴，尽管我不想让他知道有关我那可怕的工作的任何事情。</p>
<p>Henry and I reached London in early October and stayed there for a few months．I met and talked with English scientists，and learnt many useful things from them．Then Henry was invited to visit some friends in Scotland．I planned to travel with him，but I told him that I wanted to go walking in the mountains alone． Henry was not happy with my plan， but in the end he agreed．</p>
<p>亨利和我于10月初到达伦敦并在那儿呆了几个月。我同几个英国科学家见了面并谈了话，并从他们那儿了解到许多有用的东西。后来亨利被邀请去拜访几位苏格兰朋友。我计划同他一起去，但告诉他说我想独自一人在山中散步。亨利对我的计划不满，但最终还是同意了。</p>
<p>I bought all that I needed for a laboratory， and sent every-thing to Scotland．Henry and I travelled to Edinburgh together，and then I went further north，to find a good place for my laboratory．At last I found the right place on an island off the north coast．It was a wild and lonely place．Only five people lived on the island， so I could work alone， and nobody would discover my awful secret．</p>
<p>我买了实验室所需的一切东西，并把所有的东西都送到了苏格兰。亨利同我一起到了爱丁堡，然后我继续朝北走，以便为我的实验室找到合适的地点。最后我在远离北部海岸的一个岛上找到了合适的地点。那是个荒凉偏僻的地方。岛上只有五个人居住，因而我可以独自工作，没有人会发现我那可怕的秘密。</p>
<p>There was a large， empty hut on the island，and I brought builders from Scotland to make the hut into a laboratory for me．I showed them how to build my mast，and soon everything was ready for me to start work on the woman monster．</p>
<p>岛上有一个大的空茅屋；我从苏格兰带去了建筑工人以便把茅屋改造成我的实验室。我指示他们如何建杆子，不久所有为我造女怪物的准备工作均已就绪。</p><a href='11.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
