<p>I decided to leave Geneva for ever．I took all the money that I needed，and left the town．Before I left，I went to visit the place where William，Elizabeth，and my father lay at rest．I stood there and promised them that I would stay alive until I had killed the monster．</p>
<p>我决定永远离开日内瓦。我带上了我所需要的一切费用便离开了那个城市。走之前，我去了威廉、伊丽莎白还有我父亲的安息之处。我站在那儿向他们发誓我要活到杀死那个怪物之时。</p>
<p>A loud，evil laugh rang out through the silent night．Then I heard the monsters's voice：‘It pleases me that you have decided to live， because that is just what I want．’</p>
<p>一声响亮而邪恶的笑声响彻了静静的夜空。接着我听到怪物的声音：“你决定活下去我很高兴，因为这正是我想要的。”</p>
<p>I ran towards the voice，but I could not catch the monster．I saw him running away， but he ran faster than any man could go—too fast for me to catch． But I followed him，and I have been following him since that day．I shall stay alive until I can catch him．He wants me to live as long as possible．He wants me to feel，day after day，the pain and misery that he has given me．He leaves messages to tell me where he is．He knows that I shall follow him．</p>
<p>我朝声音的方向跑去，但没有抓到他。我看着他跑开了，只是他跑得比任何人都快——太快了，我没法赶上他。但我跟踪着他，打那天起我一直在跟踪他。我要活到抓住他的那一天。他希望我尽可能活得长一些，以便我日复一日地感受到他带给我的痛苦和悲伤。他给我留下口信告诉我他在什么地方。他知道我会跟踪他的。</p>
<p>I am only happy when I am asleep．I dream that I am with my family， and Elizabeth and Henry．When I am awake，I look forward to my death， to the day when I shall be with them．</p>
<p>只有在熟睡时我才感到快乐。我梦见我同我的家人们、伊丽莎白和亨利在一起。我醒来时便盼望着死去，盼望着和他们在一起的那一天。</p>
<p>In his last message the monster told me that he was going north．He wanted to take me where the cold would hurt me and make me more miserable．I followed him to the cold lands of the north，and bought dogs and a sledge．Until now， he has always left me further and further behind when I chase him．But the dogs were very fast and I was getting closer and closer to him．Soon he was only one day's journey in front of me．He was going towards the sea， and I hoped to catch him before he reached it．The chase over the ice continued for about three weeks．The pain from the cold was very great，and I began to lose hope．I thought I would never catch him．My dogs could not run much further， and one of them died．Then I saw some-thing on the ice in front of me．It was the monster and his sledge．Suddenly I was full of hope again，and I gave a great shout of happiness．</p>
<p>在怪物留下的最后的一个口信中，他告诉我说他要去北方。他是想把我带到寒冷的地方受煎熬，以便让我更加痛苦。我跟踪他来到北方寒冷的地方，并且买了狗和雪橇。直到现在，自打我追赶他的那个时候起，他就一直把我远远地甩到后面。可是狗跑得很快，这让我离他越来越近。不久他便离我只剩下一天的行程了。他在朝大海的方向跑去，而我希望在他到达大海之前抓住他。冰上的追逐持续了三个星期。严寒给我带来了巨大的痛苦，我开始失去信心了。我想我永远也别想追上他了。我的狗再也跑不动了，其中还死了一只。后来我看到在我前面的冰上有个什么东西。那是怪物和他的雪橇。突然间我又充满了希望，于是欢快地大喊了起来。</p>
<p>I got closer and closer to him．Then a great storm started．The ice began to break，and the sea carried him away from me．My sledge was broken，and I lost my dogs．I was left on a piece of ice that was becoming smaller all the time．Many hours went by，and then I saw your ship．The rest you know．</p>
<p>我离他越来越近。后来刮起了一场大的风暴。冰开始破裂，海水载着他远我而去。我的雪橇毁了，狗也都丢了。我被困在一块不断消融的冰上。好几个小时之后，我看见了你们的轮船。接下来的事你都知道了。</p>
<p>I ask you，Captain Walton，to chase the monster and kill him．Do not listen to what he says．He knows how to argue，and perhaps you will feel sorry for him．But remember that he is evil．Remember the deaths of William，Justine，Henry Clerval，Elizabeth，my father…and remember me， Victor Frankenstein．</p>
<p>我请求你，沃尔顿船长，请你去追上并杀死那个怪物。不要听他说什么。他知道怎样辩解，你可能还会同情他的。但你要记住他是邪恶的，要想到威廉、贾斯廷亨利&middot;克勒沃、伊丽莎白、我父亲这些人的死……还有我，弗兰肯斯坦。</p>
<p>There is no more for me to say，except to thank you，Captain Walton，for your help and kindness．Thank you also for listening to my story．I want you to tell the world that the monster is a danger to everyone．</p>
<p>我没有更多要说的了；只是我得谢谢你，沃尔顿船长，谢谢你的帮助和善心，也感谢你倾听了我的故事。我想让你叫全世界的人都知道那个怪物对所有的人来说都是个危险。</p>
<p>I know that I have only a few hours left to live，but I can feel my loved ones near me， and I welcome death．</p>
<p>我知道我只能再活几个小时了，但我能够感觉到我所爱的人们离我近了，因而我欢迎死亡的到来。</p>
<p>Goodbye．This is the end of Victor Frankenstein's story．</p>
<p>再见。这就是维克多&middot;弗兰肯斯坦的故事的结尾。</p><a href='15.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
