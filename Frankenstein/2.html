<p>I studied very hard at school．I wanted to know the secrets of life， and， most of all， I wanted to know how to make living things．I read all the books that I could find．One day，some－thing happened that added a new idea to the ideas that I al－ready had．I was fifteen at the time， and we were on holiday in the mountains． There was a wild storm， and with it came the most frightening thunder and lightning that I had ever seen in my life． About twenty metres in front of our house was a great tree．Suddenly a huge fork of lightning hit the tree．After a few seconds， there was nothing left of it except a black piece of wood two metres high． The lightning had destroyed it．</p>
<p>我在学校学得很刻苦。我想要知道生命的奥秘，而且我最想知道的便是如何制造有生命的东西。我<a href="http://www.tingvoa.com/English_News/" target="_blank" class="infotextkey">阅读</a>了我能找到的一切书籍。有一天发生了一件事情，它给我新的启发。我那时15岁，我们正在山中度假。那天有一场暴风雨，夹杂其间的是我平生见过的最为吓人的雷霆和闪电。在我们的房子前面约二十米处有一棵大树。突然间一个叉状闪电击中了大树。 几秒钟之后，那棵大树便只剩下两米高的一块黑木头。闪电摧毁了它。</p>
<p>I saw how strong electricity was． I began to read all the books that I could find about electricity and its terrible power．</p>
