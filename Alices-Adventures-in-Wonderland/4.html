<p><b>4 切舍猫 </b></p>
<p>There was a boy outside the door，with a large letter in his hand．(He was dressed like a boy，but his face was very like a fish，Alice thought．)The Fish-Boy knocked at the door，and a second later a large plate came flying out of an open window．</p>
<p>门外站着一个男孩，手里拿着好大的一封信。（他穿得像个男孩，爱丽丝觉得他的脸却很像一条鱼。）鱼孩敲了一下门，眨眼功夫一个大盘子从一扇打开的窗户飞了出来。</p>
<p>'A letter for the Duchess，'the Fish-Boy shouted．He pushed the letter under the door and went away．</p>
<p>“有封给公爵夫人的信，”鱼孩大喊道。他把信从门下塞了进去，然后走开了。</p>
<p>Alice went up to the door and knocked，but there was a lot of noise inside and nobody answered．So she opened the door and walked in．</p>
<p>爱丽丝走上前去敲了敲门，里面一片嘈杂声，却无人应门。于是她打开门，走了进去。</p>
<p>She found herself in a kitchen，which was full of smoke．There was a very angry cook by the fire，and in the middle of the room sat the Duchess，holding a screaming baby．Every few minutes a plate crashed to the floor．There was also a large cat，which was sitting on a chair and grinning from ear to ear．</p>
<p>她发现自己在一个小厨房里，厨房里尽是烟。火边有一个厨师，气哼哼地；在房间中央坐着公爵夫人，抱着一个正尖声大叫的婴儿。每隔几分钟就有一个盘子摔到地上。椅子上坐着一只很大的猫，正咧着大嘴笑呢。</p>
<p>'Please，'Alice said politely to the Duchess，'why does your cat grin like that？'</p>
<p>“请问，”爱丽丝客客气气地对公爵夫人说，“你的猫为什么那样咧着嘴笑？”</p>
<p>'It's a Cheshire Cat，'said the Duchess．'That's why．'</p>
<p>“这是一只切舍猫，”公爵夫人说，“这就是原因。”</p>
<p>'I didn't know that cats could grin，'said Alice．</p>
<p>“我不知道猫会咧着嘴笑，”爱丽丝说。</p>
<p>'Well，you don't know much，'said the Duchess．Another plate crashed to the floor and Alice jumped．'Here！'the Duchess went on．'You can hold the baby for a bit，if you like．The Queen has invited me to play croquet，and I must go and get ready．'She pushed the baby into Alice's arms and hurried out of the room．</p>
<p>“你不知道的事多着呢，”公爵夫人说。又有一只盘子摔到地上，爱丽丝跳了起来。“来！”公爵夫人接着说：“要是你愿意，这个孩子给你抱一会儿吧。王后请我打槌球，现在我得去准备一下。”她把孩子塞到爱丽丝的怀里，急匆匆地走出去了。</p>
<p>'Oh，the poor little thing！'said Alice，looking at the baby， which had a very strange face．She took it outside into the wood and walked around under the trees．Then the baby began to make strange noises，and Alice looked into its face again．Its eyes were really very small for a baby，and its nose now looked very like the nose of a pig．</p>
<p>“噢，可怜的小东西！”爱丽丝说。她看了看孩子的脸，真是张很奇怪的脸。她带着它出了门，在树林里转了转。它开始发出一种奇怪的声音，爱丽丝又看看它的脸。眼睛很小，不像婴孩的眼睛，鼻子看起来像猪鼻子。</p>
<p>'Don't make noises like that，my dear，'said Alice．'It's not polite．You're beginning to sound like a pig．'</p>
<p>“亲爱的，别那样出声，”爱丽丝说。“这很不礼貌，听起来会像头猪一样。”</p>
<p>But a few minutes later，there was no mistake．It was a pig．Alice put it carefully on the ground，and it ran quietly away on its four legs into the wood．</p>
<p>但过了一会儿这就算不上一个错误了。它确实是只猪。爱丽丝小心地把它放在地上，它四条腿着地，静静地跑进森林里去了。</p>
<p>'I'm pleased about that，'Alice said to herself．'It will be a good-looking pig，but it would be terrible to be a child with a face like that．</p>
<p>“我很高兴，”爱丽丝自言自语道。“它会是只漂亮的猪，可小孩要长这么一张脸就太可怕了。”</p>
<p>She was thinking about pigs and children when she suddenly saw the Cheshire Cat in a tree．The Cat grinned at her，and she went nearer to it．</p>
<p>正当她想着猪和小孩时，突然看见切舍猫正坐在一棵树上。猫冲她咧嘴一笑，爱丽丝向它靠了靠。</p>
<p>'Please，'she said，'can you tell me which way to go from here？'</p>
<p>她说：“请你告诉我，从这儿我该往哪条路走？”</p>
<p>'But where do you want to get to？'said the Cat．</p>
<p>“可你要上哪儿去呀？”猫问。</p>
<p>'It doesn't really matter—'began Alice．</p>
<p>“去哪儿倒无所谓——”爱丽丝答道。</p>
<p>'Then it doesn't matter which way you go，'said the Cat．</p>
<p>“那你走哪条路都行。”猫说。</p>
<p>'But I would like to get somewhere，'Alice explained．</p>
<p>“但我想去个什么地方。”爱丽丝解释道。</p>
<p>'If you just go on walking，'said the Cat，'in the end you'll arrive somewhere．'</p>
<p>“如果你一直走，你总会到个什么地方的。”猫说。</p>
<p>That was true，thought Alice，but not very helpful，so she tried another question．'What kind of people live near here？'</p>
<p>这倒是真的，爱丽丝想，可毫无意义。所以她试着问点别的。“这附近都住着什么样的人？”</p>
<p>'To the left，'the Cat said，'lives a Hatter．And to the right，lives a March Hare．You can visit either of them．They're both mad．'</p>
<p>猫回答：“左边住着一个制帽人。右边住了一只三月兔。你可以去看看他们中的谁。可他们都疯了。”</p>
<p>'But I don't want to visit mad people，'said Alice．</p>
<p>“我可不想去看疯子。”爱丽丝说。</p>
<p>'We're all mad here，you know，'said the Cat．'I'm mad．You're mad．'</p>
<p>“你得知道，这儿人人都是疯子。”切舍猫说：“我是疯子，你也是疯子。”</p>
<p>'How do you know that I'm mad？'said Alice．</p>
<p>“你怎么知道我疯了？”爱丽丝问。</p>
<p>'Of course you're mad，'said the Cat．'Only mad people come here．'</p>
<p>“你当然是疯子，”切舍猫说。“到这儿来的人都疯了。”</p>
<p>Alice was thinking about this，but the Cat went on，'Are you playing croquet with the Queen today？'</p>
<p>爱丽丝还在想着这个事，猫又接着问：“今天你去跟王后打槌球吗？”</p>
<p>'I would like to very much，'said Alice，'but nobody has invited me yet．'</p>
<p>“我很想去，”爱丽丝说，”可没人请我埃”</p>
<p>'You'll see me there，'said the Cat，and vanished．</p>
<p>“你在那儿会看到我的。”切舍猫说，然后一下子不见了。</p>
<p>Alice was not really surprised at this，because so many strange things were happening today．She was still looking at the tree when，suddenly，the Cat appeared again．</p>
<p>爱丽丝也不觉得奇怪，因为今天发生了那么多奇怪的事。她还在那儿盯着树看，突然，切舍猫又出现了。</p>
<p>'I forgot to ask，'said the Cat．'What happened to the baby？'</p>
<p>“我忘了问，”猫说：“那娃娃怎么啦？”</p>
<p>'It turned into a pig，'Alice said．</p>
<p>“变成了一头猪。”爱丽丝说。</p>
<p>'I'm not surprised，'said the Cat，and vanished again．</p>
<p>“我一点也不觉得奇怪。”猫说，然后又不见了。</p>
<p>Alice began to walk on，and decided to visit the March Hare．'It's the month of May now，'she said to herself，'so perhaps the Hare won't be as mad as he was in March．'</p>
<p>爱丽丝开步走了，决定去拜访三月兔。她想：“现在是五月，不是三月，也许这只兔不像在三月份那么疯了。”</p>
<p>Suddenly，there was the Cheshire Cat again，sitting in another tree．Alice jumped in surprise．</p>
<p>突然，切舍猫又出现了。它坐在另一棵树上。爱丽丝吃惊地跳了起来。</p>
<p>'Do you think，'she said politely，'that you could come and go more slowly？'</p>
<p>“你说，”爱丽丝客气地说：“你可以慢一点一会儿出现，一会儿隐没吗？”</p>
<p>'All right，'said the Cat．And this time it vanished very slowly．First its tail went，then its body，then its head，and last，the grin．</p>
<p>“可以。”猫说。这次，它慢慢地隐没。先是尾巴没了，然后是身体、头，最后，咧着笑的嘴。</p>
<p>'Well！I've often seen a cat without a grin，'thought Alice，'but never a grin without a cat！'</p>
<p>“我常看见不咧开嘴笑的猫，”爱丽丝想，“可还没见过有咧开的嘴而没有身子的猫。”</p>
<p>Soon she saw the house of the March Hare in front of her．It was a large house，so she ate a little piece of mushroom to get bigger，and walked on．</p>
<p>一会儿她看到三月兔的房子就在眼前。房子挺大，所以爱丽丝吃了一小片蘑菇以便长大一点，然后走上前去。</p><a href='5.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
