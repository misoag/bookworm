<p><b>5 使吉姆获得自由的计划 </b></p>
<p>When I heard that，I nearly fell through the floor，but it was a big piece of luck．It was easy for me to be Tom Sawyer because Tom was my best friend．He and his brother Sid lived with their Aunt Polly up in St Petersburg， and I knew all about them．Now I learnt that Aunt Polly had a sister，who was Mrs Phelps．She and her husband were Tom's Aunt Sally and Uncle Silas．And Tom was coming down south by boat to stay with them for a bit．</p>
<p>当我听到这话时，我差点儿没掉进地板缝里去，不过，这可是太幸运了。冒充汤姆&middot;索亚对我来说是件容易事，因为，汤姆是我最好的朋友。他和他的弟弟锡德和他们的菠莉姨妈一起住在圣彼得斯堡，他们的事我都知道，现在，我知道了菠莉姨妈有一个妹妹，她是斐尔普斯太太。她和她的丈夫是汤姆的萨莉姨妈和赛拉斯姨夫。汤姆要乘船南下和他们小住一阵。</p>
<p>We all sat there talking and I could answer all their questions about the Sawyer family．I was feeling really happy about this when suddenly I heard a boat on the river．'Tom could be on that boat，'I thought，'and he's going to walk in here and call out my name before I can stop him．I've got to go and meet him．'</p>
<p>我们都坐在那儿聊着天，我可以回答所有的有关索亚家的问题。对此我感到很高兴。突然，我听到河上的船声。“汤姆可能在那条船上，”我想着，“他会走进这屋里来，我还来不及阻止他，他就会大声喊出我的名字。我得去迎他。”</p>
<p>So I told the Phelpses that I would go into town to get my bags， which were at the boat station．I hurried up the road and before I was halfway to town，there was Tom Sawyer coming along．</p>
<p>于是，我告诉斐尔普斯一家，我要到镇子上的船站去取我的包。我急忙上路，还没走出一半路远，汤姆&middot;索亚沿路走来了。</p>
<p>When he saw me， his mouth fell open and he looked a bit white in the lace．'Aren't you dead？'he said．'Everybody said that you were murdered！'</p>
<p>他看见我时，嘴张着，脸色略微发白，“难道你没死？”他说道，“大家都说，你被杀死了！”</p>
<p>'I'm not dead yet，'I said，'but listen…'I told him about my adventures，and Tom loved all that．Then I told him about the Phelpses and that they thought I was Tom Sawyer．'What shall we do？'I asked him．</p>
<p>“我还没死呢，”我说道，“可你听着……”我对他讲了我的冒险，汤姆非常喜爱这一切。然后，我跟他讲了斐尔普斯一家的事，并告诉他，他们以为我是汤姆&middot;索亚。“我们该怎么办呢？”我问他。</p>
<p>Tom thought for a bit，and then he said，'I know．You take my bags and say they're yours． I'll come to the house in about half an hour．'</p>
<p>汤姆略加思索，然后说道，“我知道怎么办。你把我的包拿去，就说是你的。我大约半小时后到。”</p>
<p>'All right，'I said，'but there's another thing．You know old Miss Watson's slave Jim， who ran away？ Well，he's a prisoner here，and I'm going to help him escape．'</p>
<p>“好吧，”我说，“可还有一件事。你知道老沃森小姐的奴隶吉姆吗？他逃走了。唉，他是这儿的一个囚犯，我打算帮助他逃走。”</p>
<p>'Jim？'Tom said．'But he's—'Then he stopped and thought．'Right．I'll help，too，I'll make a really good plan．'He looked very excited．</p>
<p>“吉姆？”汤姆说道，“可他是——”然后，他停下来思考了一下。“好吧，我也帮忙。我要制定一个很好的计划。”他看起来很兴奋。</p>
<p>So I went back to the house with the bags，and Tom came along half an hour later．He knocked on the door and when his Aunt Sally opened it， he said he was Sid， Tom's brother．He wanted his visit to be a surprise for his dear old Aunt Sally，he said．</p>
<p>于是，我拿着包回去了，汤姆半小时后来了。他敲了敲门，萨莉姨妈开门时，他说，他是锡德，汤姆的弟弟。他想使他的来访给他那亲爱的萨莉姨妈一个惊喜，他说道。</p>
<p>Well，Aunt Sally was very pleased to see Tom and Sid．She thought it was wonderful．She and Uncle Silas were really nice people．</p>
<p>嘿，萨莉姨妈看见汤姆和锡德真是高兴极了。她觉得这真是好极了。她和赛拉斯姨夫的确是很好的人。</p>
<p>When we were alone later，Tom and I talked about Jim's escape．I said I had a plan，and Tom listened to it．</p>
<p>我们俩单独在一起时，我和汤姆谈起了吉姆逃跑的事。我说，我有一个计划，汤姆听着我的计划。</p>
<p>'It's a good plan，'he said when I finished．'But it's too easy！ It's got to be a real escape，like a real adventure in a sto-ry-book．So we want something difficult and dangerous．Now，listen to this…'</p>
<p>“这是一个好计划，”我讲完后他说道，“可太容易了！得像个真正的逃跑，像故事书中的真正的冒险。所以，我们要让这冒险困难点，危险点。听听这个……”</p>
<p>So he told me his plan．I knew it would be a good one be-cause Tom's plans are always crazy and exciting．</p>
<p>于是，他告诉了我他的计划。我明白，这会是一个出色的计划，因为，汤姆的计划41奋总是既疯狂又兴奋。</p>
<p>And we sure had a lot of fun with that plan！We knew that Jim was locked up in a hut outside the house．Every night we got out through our bedroom window and dug a hole right under the wall of the hut．It took us a week，and it was hard work．We talked to Jim secretly and told him about the plan，and he was really pleased．</p>
<p>执行那计划肯定会给我们带来许多的乐趣！我们知道，吉姆被锁在屋外的一个小屋里。每天夜里，我们都从卧室的窗户钻出去，就在小屋墙下挖洞。挖洞花费了我们一星期的时间，这是一件苦差事。我们秘密地同吉姆交谈，并告诉他我们的计划，他高兴极了。</p>
<p>We also wrote secret letters to everybody．Tom said that people always do this in books．We wrote that there was a gang of slave-thieves coming up from the south．They wanted to steal Jim and get the three hundred dollars from his owner．Well，the Phelpses and their friends got very excited， and on the night of the escape I went into the sitting-room，and there was a crowd of men in there—all with guns！</p>
<p>我们也给大家写密信。汤姆说，书中人们总是这样做。我们写道，有一群盗奴贼从南方来。他们想偷走吉姆，从他的主人那儿得到300美元。斐尔普斯一家和他们的朋友很兴奋，逃跑的那天夜里，我走进起居室，那儿有一大群男人——都拿着枪！</p>
<p>I ran and told Tom， and he said that this was really good．'It's a real adventure now， all right，'he said， very excited．'Perhaps they'll come after us，and shoot，and we'll all get killed！'</p>
<p>我跑去告诉了汤姆，他说，这真不错。“好吧，这是一次真正的冒险，”他说道，很兴奋，“或许他们会追我们，开枪，我们都会被打死！”</p>
<p>Well，there wasn't time to think about it because it all happened so quickly．We got Jim out through the hole under the wall，and began to run down to the river．But the men heard us and came after us．They began to shoot，and so we ran as fast as we could to the canoe．We got in it and went over to Spanish Island．My raft was there，and our plan was to escape on that and go on down river．</p>
<p>没有时间考虑了，因为，这一切发生得太快了。我们把吉姆从墙下的洞里弄出来，开始往河边跑去。但是，那些人听到了我们的声音，追了过来，他们开始开枪，我们尽快地往独木舟那儿跑去。我们上了独木舟，前往西班牙岛，我的木筏停在那儿，我们的计划就是逃到那岛上，然后继续顺流而下。</p>
<p>'Now，Jim，'I cried，'you're a free man！'We were all very happy，but Tom was the happiest of all，because he had a bullet in his leg．</p>
<p>“嗨，吉姆，”我喊道，“你是一个自由之人了！”我们都很高兴，可汤姆是最高兴的一个，因为，他腿上中了一枪。</p>
<p>When Jim and I heard that，we weren't so happy．Tom wanted the adventure to go on， but Jim and I said that a doctor must look at Tom's leg．Tom was getting angry about this，but Jim said：</p>
<p>我和吉姆听到这话时，可不那么高兴了。汤姆想让这冒险继续下去，可我和吉姆说，一定要找个医生看看汤姆的腿。汤姆对此生气了，可吉姆说道：</p>
<p>'You listen to me，Tom Sawyer．You say I'm a free man now，and perhaps I am．But old Jim is not going to run away and leave one of his friends with a bullet in his leg！ So I'm staying right here until a doctor comes．'</p>
<p>“你听我说，汤姆&middot;索亚。你说，我现在是一个自由人了，或许我是。可老吉姆不会逃跑，而丢下一个腿里有颗子弹的朋友！所以，我就呆在这儿，一直到医生来。”</p>
<p>I knew Jim would say that． He was a good， true friend， and you can't say that about many people．</p>
<p>我知道，吉姆会这样说的。他是一个真正的好朋友，对许多其他的人，你不会这样说的。</p>
<p>Well，that was the end of the adventure，really．I went and found a doctor in the town．He was a kind old man，and he said he would go over to the island． But Tom's leg got very bad，and the next day the doctor and some other men carried Tom home to the Phelpses' house．They brought Jim too， and they locked him up in the hut again．But the doctor said，'Be kind to him， because he didn't run away and he stayed to help me with the boy．'</p>
<p>说真的，这就是冒险的结束。我去到镇上找了个医生。他是个和蔼的老人，他说，他会到岛上去。可汤姆腿的伤势很重，第二天，医生和其他的一些人把汤姆抬到斐尔普斯家。他们也带回了吉姆，他们又把他锁在木屋里。可医生说，“对他好点儿，因为他没逃跑，他留在那儿帮我照顾这个男孩。”</p>
<p>They took Tom up to bed because his leg was really bad，and Aunt Sally sat with him while he slept．I didn't want to answer any questions so I kept out of everybody's way．</p>
<p>他们把汤姆放在床上，因为，他腿的伤势很重。他睡觉时，萨莉姨妈坐在他的身边。我不想回答任何问题，所以，我远远地躲开大家。</p>
<p>When Tom woke up the next day，he felt better．I was in the room and he said to me，'Jim's all right，isn't he？'</p>
<p>第二天，汤姆醒来时，他感觉好多了。我在他房间里，他对我说，“吉姆没事儿，是吧？”</p>
<p>I didn't know what to say because Aunt Sally was listening， and before I could stop him，Tom went on：</p>
<p>我不知道说什么好，因为萨莉姨妈在听着，我还来不及阻止他，汤姆继续说道：</p>
<p>'We did it，Aunt Sally．Me and Tom here．We helped Jim escape．'He told her all about the digging and everything，and Aunt Sally's mouth was opening and closing like a fish．Then she got really angry with Tom．</p>
<p>“这件事是我们干的，萨莉姨妈。是我和汤姆。我们帮助吉姆逃跑的。”他把挖洞和所有的一切都告诉了她，萨莉姨妈的嘴像条鱼一样一张一闭。然后，她真的生汤姆的气了。</p>
<p>'That slave is locked up again and he's going to stay there．And if I catch you again—'</p>
<p>“那个奴隶又被锁了起来，他要呆在那儿。如果我再抓到你——”</p>
<p>Tom suddenly sat up in bed．'You can't do that！'he cried．'Jim was old Miss Watson's slave， but she died two months ago．Before she died，she wrote that she wanted Jim to be free，and not a slave any more．Jim's a free man，not a slave！</p>
<p>汤姆突然在床上坐起来。“你不能那样做！”他喊道，“吉姆是老沃森小姐的奴隶，可她两个月前去世了。死前她写道，她要让吉姆自由，不再是一个奴隶了。吉姆是一个自由人，不再是一个奴隶！”</p>
<p>Well，that was a surprise to me and Aunt Sally！She thought Tom was crazy．'But Sid，why did you help him to escape，if he was free already？'she said．</p>
<p>我和萨莉姨妈都感到很惊讶！她觉得汤姆疯了。“可是，锡德，如果他已经自由了，那你为什么还帮他逃跑呢？”她说道。</p>
<p>'I wanted the adventure，of course！'said Tom．'We made a really exciting plan and… Oh my！…AUNT POLLY！'</p>
<p>“当然，我想冒险！”汤姆说。“我们制定了一个很令人兴奋的计划，并且……呀，天哪！……菠莉姨妈！”</p>
<p>We turned round，and there was Tom's Aunt Polly in the doorway！That was the second big surprise．Aunt Sally was really pleased to see her sister，and jumped up to put her arms round her． I got under the bed as fast as I could．There was trouble coming for me and Tom， that was for sure．</p>
<p>我们转过身来，汤姆的菠莉姨妈站在门那儿！这是第二个令人大吃一惊的事。萨莉姨妈见到她的姐姐的确很高兴，跳起来搂住了她。我赶快爬到床底下。我和汤姆要有麻烦了，这是肯定无疑的。</p>
<p>Then Aunt Polly said to Tom，'You always were a terrible boy，Tom Sawyer，and I want to know—'</p>
<p>然后，菠莉姨妈对汤姆说道，“你总是捣乱，汤姆&middot;索亚，我想知道——”</p>
<p>'But Polly dear，'said Aunt Sally，'this isn't Tom．It's Sid．Tom was here a minute ago．Where is he？'</p>
<p>“可是，亲爱的菠莉，”萨莉姨妈说道，“这不是汤姆，是锡德。汤姆刚才还在这哪。他哪儿去了？”</p>
<p>'Where's Huck Finn，you mean，' replied Aunt Polly．'Come out from under that bed， Huck Finn．'</p>
<p>“你是指哈克&middot;费恩哪儿去了？”菠莉姨妈回答道，“从床底下出来，哈克&middot;费恩。”</p>
<p>So Tom and I had to explain everything．Aunt Polly said that Aunt Sally wrote and told her that Tom and Sid were there．She knew that it wasn't true， so she decided to come and find out what was happening．But she said that it was true about Miss Watson and that Jim was a free man now．</p>
<p>所以，我和汤姆不得不解释所有这一切。菠莉姨妈说，萨莉姨妈写信告诉她，汤姆和锡德在那儿。她知道这不是真的，于是，她决定来弄清楚到底是怎么回事。可她说，沃森小姐的事倒是真的，吉姆现在是一个自由人了。</p>
<p>We got Jim out of the hut and Aunt Sally and Uncle Silas were really nice to him．Later，Tom， Jim and I had a long talk by ourselves．Tom talked and talked，and then he said，'Let's all three of us run away one night，and go and have ad-ventures in the wild country down south．'</p>
<p>我们把吉姆从小屋里放出来，萨莉姨妈和赛拉斯姨夫待他很友好。后来，汤姆、吉姆和我，就我们三个人，聊了很长时间。汤姆不停地说着，然后，他说道，“有那么一天夜里，我们三个人逃走，到南方荒野的地方去冒险。”</p>
<p>It sounded like a good plan to me．'The only thing is，'I said，'I haven't got any money to buy the right clothes and things．All my money back in St Petersburg will be in Pop's pockets by now．'</p>
<p>听起来倒是一个不错的计划。“唯一的事情是，”我说道，“我没有钱买合适的衣服和物品。我所有的在圣彼得斯堡的钱这时应该在爸爸的兜里了。”</p>
<p>'No，'said Tom．'Your money's all there．Your Pop never came back．'</p>
<p>“不会的，”汤姆说道，“你的钱都在那儿。你爸爸从来没回来。”</p>
<p>'No，and he won't come back，Huck，'Jim said．'You remember that dead man on the river，when I said“Don't look at his face”？Well，that was your Pop．You can get your money when you want．'</p>
<p>“对了，他不会回来了，哈克，”吉姆说道，“你记得河上那个死人吗？我说别看他的脸，那就是你爸爸。你想拿到钱时，你就能拿到。”</p>
<p>Tom's leg is almost better now， and I haven't got any more to write about．I'm really pleased about that because it was very difficult to write a book and I won't do it again．But I think I'm going to have to run away before the others，because Aunt Sally wants me to live with her． I'll have to sleep in a bed and wear clean clothes and learn to be good，and I can't do that again．I've done it once already．</p>
<p>汤姆的腿现在差不多好了，我没有什么要写的了。对此我很高兴，因为，写一本书很难，我不会再写了。可我想，在其他人逃跑之前，我得准备先逃走，因为萨莉姨妈想让我和她住在一起。我将不得不睡在床上，穿干净衣服，学着有教养，我不能再那样了。我已经尝试过一次了。</p>
<p>The End</p>
<p>──完──</p>
<p>Yours Truly</p>
<p>你的忠实的</p>
