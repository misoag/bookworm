<p><b>1 哈克遇到麻烦 </b></p>
<p>You don't know about me if you haven't read a book called The Adventures of Tom Sawyer．Mr Mark Twain wrote the book and most of it is true．In that book robbers stole some money and hid it in a very secret place in the woods．But Tom Sawyer and I found it，and after that we were rich．We got six thousand dollars each-all gold．</p>
<p>如果你没有看过《汤姆&middot;索亚历险记》那本书，你就不知道我。这本书是马克&middot;吐温写的，大部分是真实的。在那本书中，强盗们偷了钱，并把钱藏在了树林中一个很秘密的地方。但我和汤姆&middot;索亚找到了这笔钱，在这之后，我们发财了。我们每个人得到了6000美元——全是金币。</p>
<p>In those days I never had a home or went to school like Tom and all the other boys in St Petersburg．Pop was always drunk，and he moved around a lot，so he wasn't a very good father．But it didn't matter to me．I slept in the streets or in the woods，and I could do what I wanted，when I wanted．It was a fine life．</p>
<p>在那些日子里，我从来没有一个家，或是像汤姆和圣彼得斯堡所有其他的男孩那样去上学。爸爸总是喝得醉醺醺的，经常转来转去，所以，他不是一个很好的父亲。但是，这对我来说无所谓。我睡在街上或林子里，只要我想做，我就能做我想做的事情。这真是一种美好的生活。</p>
<p>When we got all that money，Tom and I were famous for a while．Judge Thatcher，who was an important man in our town，kept my money in the bank for me． And the Widow Douglas took me to live in her house and said I could be her son． She was very nice and kind，but it was a hard life because I had to wear new clothes and be good all the time．</p>
<p>当我和汤姆得到所有那些钱时，我们出了一阵子名。撒切尔法官是我们镇子上的一个重要人物，他替我将钱存在了银行。道格拉斯寡妇领我到她家去住，并说我可以做她的儿子。她非常和蔼，但这是一种令人难以忍受的生活，因为我不得不穿新衣服，而且始终都要听话。</p>
<p>In the end，I put on my old clothes and ran away．But Tom came after me and said that I had to go back，but that I could be in his gang of robbers．So，I went back，and the widow cried and I had to put on those new clothes again．I didn't like it at all．Her sister，Miss Watson，lived there too．She was al-ways saying，'Don't put your feet there，Huckleberry，'and 'Don't do that，Huckleberry．'It was terrible．</p>
<p>最后，我穿上我的旧衣服跑掉了。可汤姆追上了我说，我得回去，但我仍可以加入他的强盗团伙。所以，我回去了，寡妇叫着，我不得不又穿上那些新衣服。我根本不喜欢这一切。她的姐姐沃森小姐也住在那儿。她总是说，“别把你的脚放在那儿，哈克贝利，”还有“别干那个，哈克贝利。”真是糟透了。</p>
<p>When I went up to bed that night，I sat down in a chair by the window． I sat there a good long time， and I was really unhappy．But just after midnight I heard 'mee－yow！mee－yow！'ortside．Very softly，I answered，'mee－yow！mee－yor！' Quietly，I put out the light and got out through the window．In the trees， Tom Sawyer was waiting for me．</p>
<p>那天晚上，上床睡觉的时候，我坐在窗边的椅子上。我坐了很久，真是很难受。但是，午夜刚过，我听到外面“喵！喵！”的声音。我很轻地回答着“喵！瞄！”。我轻轻地吹灭蜡烛，从窗户钻了出去。汤姆&middot;索亚正在树丛中等我。</p>
<p>We went through the trees to the end of the widow's garden．Soon we were on top of a hill on the other side of the house．Below us we could see the river and the town．One or two lights were still on，but everything was quiet． We went down the hill and found Joe Harper， Ben Rogers and two or three more of the boys．Then Tom took us down the river by boat to his secret place，which was a cave deep in the side of a hill．When we got there， Tom told us all his plan．</p>
<p>我们穿过树丛来到寡妇的花园的尽头。不一会儿，我们就到了房子另一头的一个小山顶上。我们能看到山下的小河和镇子。一两处烛光仍亮着，但是，万物都是静悄悄的。我们下了山，找到了乔&middot;哈珀，本&middot;罗杰斯，还有两三个其他的男孩。然后，汤姆用船把我们带到了那个秘密的地方，这个秘密的地方是山坡深处的一个岩洞。当我们到那时，汤姆把他的全部计划告诉了我们。</p>
<p>'Now，we'll have this gang of robbers，'he said，'and we'll call it Tom Sawyer's Gang．If somebody hurts one of us，the others will kill him and his family． And if a boy from the gang tells other people our secrets，we'll kill him and his family，too．'</p>
<p>“现在，我们就来组织这个强盗团伙，”他说，“我们就叫它汤姆&middot;索亚团伙吧。如果有人伤害我们中的某个人，其他的人就要杀了他和他的全家。如果这个团伙的哪个男孩把我们的秘密告诉了其他人，我们也要把他和他的全家都给杀喽。”</p>
<p>We all thought this was wonderful，and we wrote our names in blood from our fingers．Then Ben Rogers said，'Now， what's the gang going to do？'</p>
<p>我们都觉得棒极了，我们用手指上的血写上了我们的名字。然后，本&middot;罗杰斯说，“这团伙到底要干些什么呢？”</p>
<p>'Nothing，'replied Tom．'Just rob and kill． We stop people on the road，and we kill them，and take their money and things．But we can keep a few of the people，and then their friends can pay money to get them back．That's what they do in the stories in books．'</p>
<p>“什么都不干，”汤姆回答道，“只是抢劫和杀人，我们在路上拦截人，杀了他们，拿走他们的钱和东西。但是，我们可以留下几个人，这佯，他们的朋友可以交钱把他们赎回去。这就是人们在书中故事里所做的。”</p>
<p>But Ben wasn't happy．'What about women？'he asked． ' Do we kill them，too?'</p>
<p>但是，本不高兴了。“女人怎么办？”他问道，“我们也杀她们吗？”</p>
<p>'Oh，no，'Tom answered．'We're very nice to them， and they all love us， and they don't want to go home．'</p>
<p>“噢，不，”汤姆回答。“我们待她们很友好，她们都爱我们，她们不想回家。”</p>
<p>'Then the cave will be full of women， and people waiting，and we'll have to watch them all night…'</p>
<p>“那么，岩洞里全都是女人，人们等待着，我们将不得不整夜监视她们……”</p>
<p>'We'll all go home now，'Tom said，'and we'll meet next week， and we'll kill somebody and rob somebody．'</p>
<p>“我们现在都回家吧，”汤姆说，“我们下周碰头，杀个什么人，抢劫个什么人。”</p>
<p>Ben wanted to begin on Sunday，but the others said no．It was bad to kill and rob on a Sunday．</p>
<p>本想星期天开始，但是，其他的人不同意。星期天杀人抢劫是不好的。</p>
<p>My clothes were very dirty and I was very tired when I got back．Of course，the next morning Miss Watson was angry with me because of my dirty clothes，but the widow just looked unhappy．Soon after that we stopped playing robbers because we never robbed people and we never killed them．</p>
<p>我回来时，衣眼很脏，我也很疲倦。第二天早晨，当然是因为我的脏衣服，沃森小姐很生我的气，可寡妇只是看上去不高兴。之后不久，我们就不玩强盗的游戏了，因为，我们从来没抢劫过人，从来没杀过人。</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Time went on and winter came．I went to school most of the time and I was learning to read and write a little．It wasn't too bad，and the widow was pleased with me．Miss Watson had a slave，an old man called Jim，and he and I were good friends．I often sat talking to Jim，but I still didn't like living in a house and sleeping in a bed．</p>
<p>时间流逝，冬天来到了。大部分时间我去学校上学，我学认字，也学着写一点。不太糟，寡妇对我挺满意。沃森小姐有一个奴隶，是个叫吉姆的老头，我和他是好朋友。我经常坐着和他聊天，但我仍然不喜欢住在房子里，睡在床上。</p>
<p>Then，one morning，there was some new snow on the ground and outside the back garden I could see footprints in the snow． I went out to look at them more carefully．They were Pop's footprints！</p>
<p>后来，一天早晨，地上覆盖了一层新雪，我能够看见后花园外边雪中的脚樱我出去更加仔细地察看，是爸爸的脚印！</p>
<p>A minute later，I was running down the hill to Judge Thatcher's house． When he opened the door，I cried，'Sir，I want you to take all my money．I want to give it to you．'</p>
<p>片刻之后，我跑下山来到了撒切尔法官家。他打开门时，我叫喊着，“先生，我要你把我的钱都拿去。我想把钱送给你。”</p>
<p>He looked surprised．'Why，what's the matter？'</p>
<p>他看上去很惊讶。“嗨，怎么回事？”</p>
<p>'Please，sir，take it！ Don't ask me why！'</p>
<p>“先生，请收下！不要问我为什么！”</p>
<p>In the end he said，'Well，you can sell it to me，then．'And he gave me a dollar and I wrote my name on a piece of paper for him．</p>
<p>最后，他说，“好吧，你可以卖给我。”他给了我一个美元，我在一张纸上为他写上了我的名字。</p>
<p>That night when I went up to my room，Pop was sitting there， waiting for me！I saw that the window was open，so that was how he got in．</p>
<p>那天晚上，当我走进我的房屋时，爸爸坐在那儿，正在等我！我看见窗户是开着的，所以，他是从窗户进来的。</p>
<p>He was almost fifty and he looked old．His hair was long and dirty and his face was a terrible white colour．His clothes were old and dirty，too，and two of his toes were coming through his shoe．He looked at me all over for a long time，and then he said，' Well，just look at those Clean，tidy clothes！And they say you can read and write now． Who said you could go to school？'</p>
<p>他差不多50岁了，显得很老。他的头发又长又脏，脸色白得可怕。他的衣眼也又旧又脏，两个脚指头从鞋里露了出来。他久久地上下打量着我，然后说道，“噢，就看看这些干净、整齐的衣服吧！他们说你现在能认字、写字了。谁说你可以上学了？”</p>
<p>'The widow…'I began．</p>
<p>“寡妇……”我开始说。</p>
<p>'Oh， she did， did she？ Well， you can forget about school．I can't read and your mother couldn't read；no one in our family could read before they died，so who do you think you are？ Go on，take that book and read to me！'</p>
<p>“噢，她说的，是吗？好吧，你可以不提学校。我不认字，你妈妈不认字；咱们家人一直到死，都没有人认字，所以，你觉得你挺不错吧，拿起那本书，给我念念！”</p>
<p>I began to read， but he hit the book and it flew out of my hand，across the room．Then he shouted，'They say you're rich—how's that？'</p>
<p>我开始念，但是，他将书打飞出我的手，穿过房间。然后，他喊道，“他们说你发财了——那是怎么回事？”</p>
<p>'It isn't true！'</p>
<p>“那不是真的！”</p>
<p>'You give me that money！I want it．Get it for me tomorrow！'</p>
<p>“你把钱给我！我要钱。明天给我把钱拿来！”</p>
<p>I haven't got any money．Ask Judge Thatcher．He'll tell you．I haven't got any money．'</p>
<p>“我没有钱。问问撒切尔法官，他会告诉你。我没有钱。”</p>
<p>'Well， give me what you've got in your pocket now．Come on， give it to me！'</p>
<p>“好吧，把你口袋里的钱给我。快点，把钱给我！”</p>
<p>'I've only got a dollar， and I want that to…'</p>
<p>“我只有一美元，我想用它去买……”</p>
<p>'Give it to me，do you hear？'</p>
<p>“把钱给我，你听见没有？”</p>
<p>He took it，and then he said he was going out to get a drink．When he was outside the window， he put his head back in and shouted，'And stop going to that school， or you know what you'll get！'</p>
<p>他拿了钱，然后，他说，他要去喝一杯。到了窗外时，他把头伸了回来，叫喊道，“别再去那个学校了，否则你清楚你会得到什么！”</p>
<p>The next day he was drunk，and he went to Judge Thatcher to get my money．The judge wouldn't give it to him．But Pop didn't stop trying and every few days I got two or three dollars from the judge to stop Pop from hitting me．But when Pop had money， he got drunk again and made trouble in town．He was always coming to the widow's house，and she got angry and told him to stay away．Then Pop got really angry and one day he caught me and took me a long way up the river in a boat．I had to stay with him in a hut in the woods and I couldn't go out by myself．He watched me all the time． The widow sent a man to find me and bring me home，but Pop went after him with a gun， and the man ran away．</p>
<p>第二天，他喝醉了，他去了撒切尔法官家去要我的钱，法官没给他。但是，爸爸不停地去要钱。每隔几天，我就从法官那儿拿两三美元给爸爸，免得他打我。但是，爸爸有钱时，就喝醉酒，在镇上惹麻烦。他总是到寡妇的家来，寡妇很气愤，让他走开。爸爸真生气了。一天，他抓住了我，用一只船带我往河上游走了很长一段路。我不得不和他呆在树林中的一个小木屋里，我不能独自外出。他一直监视着我。寡妇派了个人找我，要把我带回家，可是，爸爸拿了支枪跟在后面，那个人吓跑了。</p><a href='2.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
