<p><b>2 哈克出逃并找到一个朋友 </b></p>
<p>Mostly it was a lazy，comfortable kind of life，but after about two months Pop began to hit me too much with his stick．He often went away into town too，and then he always locked me in the hut．Once he was away for three days and I thought I was never going to get out again．</p>
<p>大多是一种懒散、舒适的生活，但是，大约两个月后，爸爸开始更加狠命地用棍子打我。他也经常离开小木屋到镇上去，那时，他总是把我锁在小木屋内。有一次，他走了三天，我想，我永远也出不去了。</p>
<p>When he came back that time，he was drunk and angry．He wanted my money，but Judge Thatcher wouldn't give it to him．The judge wanted to send me to live with the widow again，Pop told me．I wasn't very pleased about that．I didn't want to go back there．</p>
<p>那次他回来时，醉醺醺的，而且还很生气。他想要我的钱，但撒切尔法官不给他。爸爸告诉我，法官想把我送去再和寡妇住在一起。我对此不太高兴。我不想回那儿去。</p>
<p>So I decided to escape and go down the river and live in the woods somewhere． When Pop was out，I began to cut a hole in the wooden wall of the hut． In a few days，when the hole was bigger，I could take the wood cut， escape through the hole，and put the wood back．</p>
<p>所以，我决定逃走，顺流而下，住在森林里的什么地方。爸爸出去的时候，我开始在小木屋的木墙上挖洞。过不了几天，洞大些的时候，我就可以把木头拿开，从洞里逃走，然后把木头放回去。</p>
<p>One morning Pop sent me down to the river to catch some fish for breakfast．To my surprise， there was a canoe in the water and there was no one in it．Immediately，I jumped into the river and brought the canoe to the side． It was lucky that Pop didn't see me，and I decided to hide the canoe under some trees and use it when I escaped．</p>
<p>一天早晨，爸爸打发我到河里去抓鱼当早餐。令我吃惊的是河里有一只独木舟，里面没有人。我立即跳进河里，把独木舟带到了岸边。幸运的是爸爸没看见我，我决定把独木舟藏在树下，等我逃跑时好用。</p>
<p>That afternoon，Pop locked me in and went off to town．'He won't be back tonight，'I thought， so I began to work hard at my hole．Soon I could get out through it，and I carried food and drink and Pop's gun down to the canoe．Then I put back the wood to hide the hole，took the gun and went into the woods．There I shot a wild pig and took it back to the hut with me．Next，I broke down the door with an axe．I carried the pig into the hut and put some of its blood on the ground． Then I put some big stones in a sack and pulled it along behind me to the river．Last of all，I put some blood and some of my hair on the axe．I left the axe in a corner of the hut and I took the pig down to the river．</p>
<p>那天下午，爸爸把我锁在屋里到镇上去了。我想，“他今晚不会回来了，”所以，我开始拚命挖洞。不久，我就能钻出去了。我带上食品、饮料和爸爸的枪上了独木舟。然后，我把那块木头放回去把洞掩盖起来，拿上枪，进了林子。在森林里，我打了一只野猪，把它带回了小木屋。接着，我用斧子把门劈开，拖着猪进了小木屋，在地上弄了些猪血。然后，我在袋子里放了些大石头，拽着袋子一直到了河边。最后，我在斧子上弄了些血和我的头发。我把斧子丢在小木屋的一个墙角，把猪扔到了河里。</p>
<p>'They won't know it's only a pig in the river，'I said to myself．'They'll think it's me．'</p>
<p>“他们不会知道河里的东西只是一头猪，”我自言自语道。“他们会以为那是我。”</p>
<p>Then I took the canoe and went down the river to Jackson's Island． By then it was nearly dark， so I hid the canoe under some trees and went to sleep．</p>
<p>然后，找解下独木舟，顺流而下来到杰克逊岛。那时候，天快黑了，所以，我把独木舟藏在树下，然后睡觉了。</p>
<p>It was after eight o'clock when I woke up the next day and the sun was high in the sky．I was warm and comfortable and I didn't want to get up．Suddenly，I heard a noise up the river．Carefully，I looked through the trees，and I saw a boat full of people．There was Pop，Judge Thatcher，Tom Sawyer and his Aunt Polly and his brother Sid， and lots of others． They were looking for my body in the river． I watched them， but they didn't see me， and in the end they went away．I knew that nobody was going to come and look for me again．I found a good place under the trees to sleep and to put my things．Then I caught a fish and cooked it over a fire．</p>
<p>第二天当我醒来时，已是八点多了，太阳已高高挂在天空。我感觉暖融融的，很舒服，我不想起来。突然，我听到河上游一阵喧闹声，我透过树丛仔细观看，看见一艘挤满人的船。船上有爸爸、撒切尔法官、汤姆&middot;索亚和他的菠莉姨妈，还有汤姆的弟弟锡德以及许多其他的人。他们在河里寻找我的尸体。我看着他们，可他们没看见我。最后，他们走了。我知道不会有人再来找我了。我在树下找了个睡觉、放东西的好地方。然后，我抓到了一条鱼，在火上煮了。</p>
<p>I lived like that for three days， and then I decided to have a look round the island． So I went into the woods．'This is my island，'I thought．'I'm the only person on it．'</p>
<p>我在岛上就这样生活了三天。然后，我决定到岛上转一转。我进了森林。“这是我的岛，”我想，“我是这岛上唯一的一个人。”</p>
<p>Suddenly，just in front of me，I saw a fire，and it was still smoking．There was somebody on my island！I didn't wait． I turned and went straight back．But I couldn't sleep．After a time，I said to myself，'I can't live like this．I must find out who it is．'</p>
<p>突然，就在我面前，我看见了一堆火，仍然冒着烟。我的岛上还有别人！我一刻没停，转过身来，径直回到原地。但我睡不着觉。过了一段时间，我自言自语道，“我不能这样的生活下去，我必须弄清楚它是谁。”</p>
<p>Silently， I moved along the river in my canoe，under the darkness of the trees．And then I stopped．Through the trees I could see the light of a fire． Afraid， I left my canoe and went nearer．There was a man lying by the fire．Suddenly，he sat up and I saw that it was Jim，Miss Watson's slave！I was really happy to see him！'Hello，Jim，' I cried，and I jumped out from behind the tree．</p>
<p>我坐在独木舟里，借着树的黑暗，轻轻地顺流而下。然后，我停了下来。透过树丛，能看见一处火光。我胆战心惊地离开了独木舟，靠近火堆。有个人躺在火边。突然，他坐了起来，我看见那人是吉姆，沃森小姐的奴隶！看见他，我真高兴！“你好，吉姆！”我喊道，从树后跳了出来。</p>
<p>Jim fell to his knees．'Please don't hurt me！' he cried． 'I've always been good to dead people！'</p>
<p>吉姆跪了下来。“请别伤害我！”他叫道。“对死去的人，我一直总是友好的！”</p>
<p>'It's all right，Jim．I'm not dead，' I said．'But why are you here on the island？' I asked．</p>
<p>“没事儿，吉姆。我没死，”我说，“可你为什么在这个岛上呢？”我问。</p>
<p>'Well， Huck，' he began．'Old Miss Watson wanted to sell me． A man came into town and told Miss Watson that he'd buy me for eight hundred dollars．She couldn't say no， so I ran away．I ran down to the river to hide，but everybody in the town was there． They said you were dead， Huck．I had to wait all day to get away．When it was dark，I got on to a big boat and hid． When we came near this island， I jumped into the water and swam here．'</p>
<p>“唉，哈克，”他开始道，“老沃森小姐想要卖我。一个男人来到镇上告诉沃森小姐，他要花800美元买我。她答应了，所以，我就逃了。我跑到河边藏了起来，可镇上所有的人都在那儿。他们说你死了，哈克。我不得不等上一整天再逃走。天黑时，我上了一条大船，藏在那儿，当我们靠近这个岛时，我跳进水里，游到了这儿。”</p>
<p>Jim finished his story and then we both carried all our things into a cave and hid the canoe under some trees．We were just in time because then the rains came． It rained for days，and the river got higher and higher． All kinds of things came down the river and one night there was a little wooden house， lying half on its side． We got the canoe out and went to take a look．Through the window we could see a bed，two old chairs and some old clothes．There was something lying in the corner and we thought it looked like a man．Jim went in to see， but he said，'He's dead．Someone shot him in the back．Don't look at his face，Huck．It's terrible！'</p>
<p>吉姆讲完了他的经历，然后，我们俩把我们所有的东西都搬到了一个岩洞里，把独木舟藏在树下。我们刚干完，雨就下起来了。雨接连下了数日，河水越涨越高。各种各样的东西从河上游漂了下来。一天夜里，有一座小木房子斜着浮在水面上。我们把独木舟弄出来，划过去看了看。透过窗户，我们能看到一张床，两把旧椅子，还有一些旧衣服。屋角那儿躺着什么东西，看起来像个人。吉姆进去看了看，可他说，“他死了。有人在他的背后开了枪。别看他的脸，哈克。太可怕了！”</p>
<p>I didn't want to see the dead man's face，so I didn't look．We just took the old clothes and a few other things，and went back to our cave on the island．</p>
<p>我根本不想看死人的脸，所以，我没看。我们拿了些旧衣服和一些别的东西，便回到了岛上的岩洞里。</p>
<p>Another night，when we were out looking for things on the river，we found a raft．It was made of good， strong wood，and was about four metres by five metres．'This could be useful，'I said to Jim， so we pulled it back to the island behind the canoe， and tied it up under the trees．</p>
<p>又一天夜里，当我们出去寻找河上的东西时，我们发现了一个木筏子。它是由很好、很结实的木头做成的，大约5米长，4米宽。“可能会有用的，”我对吉姆说。所以，我们把它拖在小木舟后带了回来，并把它栓在了树下。</p><a href='3.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
