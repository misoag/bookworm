<p><b>6 马修和玛丽拉 </b></p>
<p>But when she arrived back at Green Gables, Anne knew at once that something was wrong. Matthew looked much older than before.</p>
<p>当她赶回格林&middot;盖布尔斯的时候，安妮立刻有一种不祥的感觉。马修看上去比以前老了很多。</p>
<p>'What's the matter with him? 'Anne asked Marilla.</p>
<p>“马修怎么了？”安妮问玛丽拉。</p>
<p>'He's had some heart trouble this year, 'replied Marilla. 'He really isn't well. I'm worried about him. '</p>
<p>“今年他的心脏病犯了几次，”玛丽拉回答。“他的情况确实不太好。我很为他担心。”</p>
<p>'And you're not looking well, Marilla, 'said Anne. 'Now you must rest, while I do the housework. '</p>
<p>“你的气色也不太好，玛丽拉，”安妮说。“现在你必须休息，家务活由我来做。”</p>
<p>Marilla smiled tiredly at Anne. 'It's not the work, it's my head. It often hurts, behind my eyes. I must see the doctor about it soon. But another thing, Anne, have you heard any-thing about the Church Bank? '</p>
<p>玛丽拉疲倦地笑了笑。“家务事倒没什么，主要是我经常头疼，就在眼睛后面。我得尽快看医生。还有一件事，安妮，你听到关于车茨银行的事了吗？”</p>
<p>'I heard it was having a difficult time. '</p>
<p>“我听说它经营困难。”</p>
<p>'All our money is in that bank. I know Matthew's worried about it. '</p>
<p>“我们所有的钱都在那家银行里。我知道马修很担心。”</p>
<p>The next morning a letter came for Matthew. Marilla saw his grey face and cried, 'What's the matter, Matthew? '</p>
<p>第二天马修接到一封信。玛丽拉看到马修的脸一下变灰了，连忙喊道：“发生什么事了，马修？”</p>
<p>Anne, who was bringing an armful of flowers into the kitchen, saw his face too. Suddenly, Matthew fell to the ground. Anne dropped her flowers and ran to help Marilla. Together they tried everything, but it was too late. Matthew was dead.</p>
<p>安妮刚刚抱着一捧花走进厨房，她也看到了马修的脸。突然，马修倒在地上。安妮扔下花来帮助玛丽拉。她们想尽了一切办法拯救马修，可已经太晚了。马修死了。</p>
<p>'It was his heart, 'said the doctor, who arrived a little later. 'Did he have any bad news suddenly? '</p>
<p>晚些时候，大夫来了，他说：“是因为他的心脏。他有没有突然听到什么不幸的消息？”</p>
<p>'The letter! 'cried Anne. 'Shall I see what's in it? Oh Mar-illa, look! The Church Bank has had to close down! Your money, and Matthew's, has all gone! '</p>
<p>“是那封信！”安妮叫道。“我能不能看看里面写了些什么？哦，玛丽拉，你看！车茨银行已经倒闭了！你的钱，还有马修的，都没了！”</p>
<p>Everybody in Avonlea was sorry to hear that Matthew was dead. For the first time in his life, Matthew Cuthbert was an important person.</p>
<p>听到马修去世的消息，埃文利村的每一个人都很难过。马修&middot;卡斯伯特这辈子第一次成了一个重要人物。</p>
<p>At first Anne couldn't cry. But then she remembered Matthew's smiling face when she told him about the Avery prize. Suddenly she started crying and couldn't stop. Marilla held her in her arms and they sobbed together.</p>
<p>起初安妮哭不出来。但当她想起马修听到她获得艾弗里奖学金时脸上的笑容，就突然忍不住大哭起来。玛丽拉搂着安妮，俩人一起哭泣。</p>
<p>'Crying can't bring him back, 'whispered Marilla. 'We'll have to learn to live without him, Anne. '</p>
<p>“哭也没法让他回来了，”玛丽拉小声说道：“我们必须学会习惯没有马修的生活，安妮。”</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>In the next few weeks Anne and Marilla worked hard together on the farm and in the house. Everybody in Avonlea was very kind to them, but it was a sad time.</p>
<p>在以后的几周里，安妮和玛丽拉在田地里和家中辛勤地劳作。埃文利村的每一个人都对她们很好，但这是一段伤心的日子。</p>
<p>One day Marilla said, 'I'll miss you when you go to Red-mond College, Anne. What are the other Avonlea students go-ing to do? '</p>
<p>一天，玛丽拉说：“你到雷德蒙德大学以后我会想念你的，安妮。埃文利村的其他孩子有何打算？”</p>
<p>'Some of them are going to teach, and some are going to stay at Queen's. '</p>
<p>“他们中的一些人会成为教师，还有一些留在女王学院。”</p>
<p>'Gilbert's going to teach at Avonlea school, isn't he? 'Anne didn't reply, so Marilla went on. 'He's very tall and good-looking now, don't you think? Like his father, John, when he was younger. You know, John and I were very good friends, years ago. '</p>
<p>“吉尔伯特将留在埃文利学校当教师，是吗？”安妮没有回答，所以玛丽拉继续说下去。“他现在已经是个高个子的帅小伙了，你不这么认为吗？像他父亲约翰年轻时一样。你知道，许多年前，约翰和我曾经是很要好的朋友。”</p>
<p>Anne looked up, interested. 'What happened? Why didn't you…? '</p>
<p>安妮很感兴趣，抬起头问道：“发生什么事了？为什么您不……？”</p>
<p>'Well, we had a fight about something. He asked me to be friends again, but I couldn't forgive him. Later I was sorry, but he didn't speak to me again. Perhaps we…Oh well, it was a long time ago. '</p>
<p>“哎，我们为了一件事吵了起来。他请求我重新成为他的好朋友，但我不能原谅他。后来我很后悔，但他再也不和我讲话了。也许我们……哎，那已经是很久以前的事了。”</p>
<p>The next day Marilla went to see the doctor. When she came back, she looked very tired and ill.</p>
<p>第二天，玛丽拉去看玻当她回来的时候，看上去非常疲倦，好像是生病了。</p>
<p>'What did the doctor say? 'asked Anne worriedly.</p>
<p>“医生说了些什么？”安妮焦急地问。</p>
<p>'He says I mustn't read or write, and I must wear glasses. Then my head won't hurt. But if I'm not very careful, I'll be blind in six months! '</p>
<p>“他说我不能再读书写字了，而且我必须戴上眼镜。那样我的头就不会疼了。如果我不小心的话，6个月以后我就会失明！”</p>
<p>For a minute Anne was silent. Then she said firmly, 'Then you must be careful, Marilla. '</p>
<p>安妮沉默了一会儿。随后她坚定地说：“您必须好好照顾自己，玛丽拉。”</p>
<p>'Think how terrible it is to be blind! But how lucky you've got a free place at Redmond College! I can't give you any money, you see. All our money's gone, and I can't work now. I think I'll have to sell the farm, and go and live with Rachel Lynde! 'and poor Marilla sobbed wildly.</p>
<p>“想想双目失明多可怕！但你能够在雷德蒙德大学免费学习真是幸运！你看，我已经没法给你钱了。我们所有的钱都没了，我现在又不能劳动。我想我必须卖掉农场，然后搬去和雷切尔&middot;林德同住！”可怜的玛丽拉边说边哭了起来。</p>
<p>That night Anne sat alone in her bedroom. She thought and thought for some time, and then she smiled. When she went to bed, she knew what she was going to do.</p>
<p>那天晚上安妮独自坐在她的卧室里。她思量了很长时间，然后她的脸上出现了笑容。当她上床休息的时候，她已经知道自己该如何去做。</p>
<p>The next day she explained it all to Marilla.</p>
<p>第二天，安妮向玛丽拉解释了一切。</p>
<p>'You can't sell Green Gables, it's our home! Just listen, I've planned everything. I'm not going to Redmond College, it's too far away. I'm going to teach, in one of the village schools near here. Then I can live there during the week and come home at weekends to look after you. Diana's father will use our fields and pay us for them, and so we'll have some money. You see? '</p>
<p>“您不能把农场卖掉，它是我们的家！您听我说，我已计划好一切。我不打算到雷德蒙德大学去，那里太遥远了。我将在附近村庄的一所学校教书。这样，平常的时候我可以住在那里，周末的时候回来照顾您。戴安娜的父亲可以使用我们的土地，同时给我们地租，这样我们就有一些钱了。您看这样不好吗？”</p>
<p>'Oh Anne! I'll be all right if you're here. But you must go to Redmond, if you want to study…'</p>
<p>“噢，安妮，你在这里我当然会很好。但如果你想学习，你必须去雷德蒙德……”</p>
<p>'Redmond College doesn't matter, 'laughed Anne. 'I'm going to study at home in the evenings. And I'm going to be a really good teacher! That's better than anything! '</p>
<p>“去不去雷德蒙德大学没有关系。”安妮笑道。“晚上我可以在家自己学习。而且我会成为一名非常出色的教师！那比什么都好！”</p>
<p>Marilla shook her head and tried not to cry. 'You're a good girl, Anne. Now we can keep Green Gables! '</p>
<p>玛丽拉摇摇头强忍住眼泪。“你是个好姑娘，安妮。现在我们可以留住农场了！”</p>
<p>A few days later Rachel Lynde came to the farm.</p>
<p>几天后，雷切尔&middot;林德来到了农常</p>
<p>'Do you know, 'she said, 'that Gilbert isn't going to be the Avonlea teacher now? '</p>
<p>“你们知道吗，”她说，“吉尔伯特现在不想当埃文利村的教师了？”</p>
<p>'Isn't he? 'cried Anne. 'Why not? '</p>
<p>“不当了？”安妮高声问道。“为什么不当？”</p>
<p>'When he heard that you wanted to be near Marilla, he de-cided to teach at a school in another village. So you can be the Avonlea teacher now. '</p>
<p>“当他听说你希望离玛丽拉近一些，他决定在另外一个村的学校教书。那样你就可以成为埃文利村的教师了。”</p>
<p>'Oh! 'said Anne, surprised. 'That's…that's very kind of him. '</p>
<p>“噢！”安妮吃惊地说。“那……那他真是太好了。”</p>
<p>And that day, when she saw Gilbert by the river, she stopped him and held out her hand.</p>
<p>那天，当安妮在河边见到吉尔伯特的时候，她叫住了他，并向他伸出手去。</p>
<p>'Gilbert, 'she said shyly, 'I… I want to thank you. It's very good of you. If I'm the Avonlea teacher, I can help Mar-illa much more at home. '</p>
<p>“吉尔伯特，”她腼腆地说，“我……我想谢谢你。你这样做真是太好了。如果我当埃文利村的教师，我就可以在家里更多地照顾玛丽拉。”</p>
<p>'I'm happy to help you, Anne, 'said Gilbert. He smiled and held her hand firmly. 'Are we going to be friends now? Have you forgiven me for calling you&quot;carrots&quot;? '</p>
<p>“能帮助你我很高兴，安妮，”吉尔伯特说。他笑着紧紧抓住安妮的手。“我们现在可以成为朋友了吗？你现在原谅我叫过你‘胡萝卜’吗？”</p>
<p>Anne laughed. 'I forgave you a long time ago. '</p>
<p>安妮笑道：“我很久以前就已经原谅你了。”</p>
<p>'I'm sure we're going to be very good friends, Anne. Can I walk home with you? '</p>
<p>“我肯定我们能成为非常好的朋友，安妮。我能送你回家吗？”</p>
<p>And when Anne came into the Green Gables kitchen, Maril-la said, 'You look very happy, Anne. Was that Gilbert who was with you just now? '</p>
<p>当安妮走进格林&middot;盖布尔斯厨房时，玛丽拉说：“你看上去非常高兴，安妮。刚才和你在一起的是吉尔伯特吗？”</p>
<p>'Yes, 'replied Anne, her face red. 'Gilbert and I've decided to be friends. Oh Marilla, I think life is going to be good for all of us! We'll have to work hard, but we'll be happy. And we'll keep our dear old Green Gables! What could be better than that! '</p>
<p>“是的，”安妮红着脸回答。“吉尔伯特和我决定成为朋友。哦，玛丽拉，我想我们都会有幸福的生活！我们的工作会很辛苦，但我们会很快乐。我们将留住我们心爱的老农场！还有什么比这更好呢！”</p></body></html>
