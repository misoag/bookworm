<p><b>8 沙尔伯爵庄园 </b></p>
<p>I lived at Birtwick Park for three happy years，but then changes came．Our mistress was often ill and the doctor advised her to go and live in a warm country for two or three years．Everyone was very sorry，but the master immediately started making arrangements to leave England．</p>
<p>我在伯特威克庄园过了快乐的3年，然后变故来了。我们的女主人经常生病，医生建议她去一个温暖的国家呆两三年。每个人都很难过，但是主人立刻着手安排离开英国。</p>
<p>John did his work silently and sadly，and Joe didn't sing any more．Then we heard that the master had sold Ginger and me to an old friend of his，Lord Gray．Merrylegs was given to the neighbour，Mr Blomefield，and Joe was employed to look after him．John was offered several good jobs but he wanted to wait and look around．</p>
<p>约翰沉默而难过地做他的事，乔也不再唱歌了。接着我们听说主人把金儿和我卖给了他的一个老朋友，格雷勋爵。乐腿儿给了邻居布劳姆菲尔德家，乔被雇去照料他。主人给约翰找了好几个好工作，然而他想再等等看。</p>
<p>'I want to train young horses，'he told the master．</p>
<p>“我想训练年轻的马，”他告诉主人说。</p>
<p>'I cannot think of anyone more suitable for that work than you，John，'said the master．'If I can help you in any way，write to me．'</p>
<p>“我简直想不出别人有谁比你更适合这工作，约翰，”主人说，“如果有什么地方需要我帮助，给我写信。”</p>
<p>The next morning，John took Ginger and me to Earlshall Park where Lord Gray lived．There was a very fine house and lots of stables．John asked for Mr York，who was going to be our new driver．</p>
<p>第二天一早，约翰把我和金儿带到格雷勋爵住的沙尔伯爵庄园。那儿有一幢非常漂亮的大房子和许多马厩。约翰找了约克先生，他是我们的新车夫。</p>
<p>Mr York was a good－looking man of about forty，with a voice that expected to be obeyed．He called a groom to take us to our boxes，then invited John to have a drink with him．We were taken to a pleasant stable and put in boxes next to one another，then we were groomed and fed．Half an hour later，John and Mr York came to see us．</p>
<p>约克先生约四十岁，长相英俊，语气中含有权威感。他叫一个马夫带我们去马厩，然后请约翰去喝一杯。我们被带到一个漂亮的马厩，栏厢互相挨着，然后洗了澡，吃了饭。半小时以后，约翰和约克先生来看我们。</p>
<p>Mr York looked at us carefully．'Is there anything you want to mention about them，Mr Manly？'he said．</p>
<p>约克先生仔细地看着我们。“曼利先生，关于他们您还有什么要交待的吗？”</p>
<p>'I don't believe there's a better pair of horses in the coun－try，'said John，'but they're not alike．The black one has the most perfect temper I've ever known．The other was badly treated before she came to us，but has grown better－tempered in the last three years．We've never used a bearing rein with either of them．'</p>
<p>“在这一带您找不到比他们更棒的两匹马了，”约翰说，“但是他们并不相同。黑色的这匹是我所见过的马中脾气最好的。另一匹来我们这儿以前，曾受过虐待，但是这3年脾气也变好了。我对他们从不用绳套。”</p>
<p>'They'll wear one here，'said York．'Lady Gray follows the fashion，and if her horses are not reined up tight，she doesn't like it．'</p>
<p>“在这儿他们得戴上，”约克说，“格雷夫人紧跟潮流，如果她的马不被紧紧地勒住，她会不喜欢的。”</p>
<p>'I'm sorry to hear that，'said John．He came to pat each of us for the last time．I held my face close to him，which was all I could do to say goodbye．And then he was gone，and I have never seen him since．</p>
<p>“真遗憾，”约翰说。他走上前来最后一次挨个拍了拍我们。我把脸凑近他，我只能这样道再见了。然后他走了，从那以后我再也没见过他。</p>
<p>Lord Gray came to look at us the next day and seemed pleased．He heard what John had said about us．'Keep an eye on the mare，'he said to York．'Don't make the bearing rein too tight at first，and I'll mention it to my wife．'</p>
<p>格雷勋爵第二天来看我们，他好像挺高兴。他听了约翰对我们的描述。“对母马注意点儿，”他对约克说，“一上来别把绳套勒得太紧，我也会对太太说的。”</p>
<p>In the afternoon，we were harnessed to the carriage and La－dy Gray came out and looked at us．She was a tall，proud-look-ing woman and did not look pleased，but she said nothing and got into the carriage．</p>
<p>下午，我们被套上车，格雷夫人出来看了看我们。她是一个高高的、表情傲慢的女人，看上去不是很高兴，但她没吱声就钻进了马车。</p>
<p>The bearing rein annoyed me but did not pull my head any higher than I was used to carrying it．I was worried about Gin－ ger，but she seemed quite happy．</p>
<p>绳套弄得我挺烦，不过倒没把我的头拉高到不舒服的地步。我为金儿担心，但她看上去倒还开心。</p>
<p>But the next afternoon when Lady Gray came down the steps，she said，'York，you must put those horses'heads higher；they don't look nice．'</p>
<p>可是第二天下午格雷夫人走下台阶时说：“约克，你必须把马头弄得高一点儿，他们看上去可不好看。”</p>
<p>'I'm sorry，my Lady，'said York，'but they have not been reined up for three years．But if it pleases you，I can take them up a little more．'</p>
<p>“对不起，夫人，”约克说，“可是他们有3年没被勒过了。不过如果您喜欢这样，我会让他们抬高一点儿的。”</p>
<p>'Do that，'she said．</p>
<p>“那就抬高吧，”她说。</p>
<p>That day we had to pull the carriage up a steep hill．I want－ed to put my head forward to make the work easier，but I couldn't．</p>
<p>那天我们得拉车爬一座很陡的小山。我想探头向前使劲，可是做不到。</p>
<p>'Now you can see what it's like，'said Ginger，when we came back．'If it doesn't get any worse，I shall say nothing．But I won't have the rein pulled up tight！'</p>
<p>“现在你知道这滋味了吧，”回来时，金儿对我说，“如果不会更糟，那我就什么也不表示，但是我可不愿被缰绳紧紧地勒起来！”</p>
<p>Each day the bearing reins were shortened a little more；then one day Lady Gray came out later than usual and said，'York，when will you get those horses'heads up？Pull them up at once，and let's have no arguing．'</p>
<p>每天绳套都勒得更紧一点儿。然后有一天，格雷太太出来得比平时晚，她说：“约克，你什么时候才能让马抬起头来？立刻拉起来，别再争论了。”</p>
<p>York came to me first and made the rein very tight．Then he went to Ginger．But the moment he took off the rein in order to shorten it，she stood up on her back legs．York and the groom could not control her．She kicked herself out of the car－riage and fell down，kicking me on the leg as she went．York sat on her head to keep her still and shouted，'Let the black horse out！Undo the carriage！Cut the harness！ '</p>
<p>约克先过来把我的绳套勒得非常紧，然后他走向金儿。可是他刚一拆下绳套，准备缩短，金儿便后腿直立起来。约克和马夫控制不住她。她从车里挣脱出来，摔倒在地，其间还踢了我的腿一下。约克骑在她头上让她动弹不得，并喊道：“把黑马弄出来，卸下马车，把绳子砍断！”</p>
<p>The groom cut me out of the harness and hurried me back to my box，then ran back to York．I was angry and my leg hurt，and I felt that I wanted to kick the first person who came near me．</p>
<p>马夫砍断绳子，把我赶回围栏，然后跑回约克那儿，我很生气，腿也疼，这时谁靠近我，我就想踢谁。</p>
<p>Soon after，Ginger was led in by two grooms．York was with her and came to look at me．</p>
<p>很快，金儿被两个马夫牵进来。约克和她一道进来，他过来看我。</p>
<p>'I knew those bearing reins would cause trouble，'he said to himself．He saw where I had been kicked and washed the place gently with hot water to help the pain．</p>
<p>“我就知道那些绳套会惹麻烦，”他自言自语。他看着我被踢伤的地方，并用热水轻轻地冲洗伤口，以止住疼痛。</p>
<p>Lord Gray was angry when he heard what had happened．He blamed York for taking orders from the mistress，and York said that he would take orders only from Lord Gray himself from now on．But things went on the same as before，except that Ginger was never put into the carriage again．I pulled it with a horse called Max who was used to the tight rein．But those four months pulling Lady Gray's carriage were terrible．The sharp bit cut into my tongue and mouth，the rein hurt my neck and made it difficult to breathe，and I felt tired and very miserable．</p>
<p>格雷勋爵听说这事后很生气。他责备约克听了女主人的话。约克说今后他只听格雷勋爵一人的命令。但是一切如常。只是金儿不再被套上马车了。我和另一匹挺习慢绳套的叫马格斯的马一起拉车。可是，给格雷太太拉车的4个月真是糟透了。锋利的嚼口切进我的舌头和嘴巴，绳套勒伤了我的脖子，我呼吸困难，疲惫不堪，境况悲惨。</p>
<p>In the spring，Lord Gray and some of his family went up to London and took York with them．Two daughters remained at the Hall．Lady Harriet never went out in the carriage，and Lady Anne preferred riding on horseback with her brother or cousins．She chose me for her horse and I enjoyed these rides，sometimes with Ginger，sometimes with Lizzie，a horse liked by the young gentlemen．</p>
<p>春天，格雷勋爵和家人去伦敦，约克随行。两个女儿留在家里。哈丽埃特小姐从不坐车出行，安小姐则最喜欢和兄弟们骑马出游。她挑我做她的坐骑，我也喜欢这种游玩，有时和金儿一起，有时和丽奇一起。年轻的先生们喜欢骑丽奇。</p>
<p>There was a gentleman called Blantyre staying at the Hall，who always rode Lizzie and was so pleased with her that Lady Anne wanted to try her．</p>
<p>有一个年轻人，叫布兰太尔，他留在大宅里。他一直非常喜欢骑丽奇，引得安小姐也想试试。</p>
<p>'I don't advise it，'said Blantyre．'She's too easily fright－ened for a lady to ride．'</p>
<p>“你最好别骑，”布兰太尔说，“她太容易受惊吓了，不适合小姐骑。”</p>
<p>'My dear cousin，'said Lady Anne，laughing，'I've been rid-ing horses since I was a baby and have followed the hounds many times．Now，help me up．'</p>
<p>“亲爱的表哥，”安小姐大笑着说，“我还是小宝宝时就开始骑马了，还参加过许多次打猎。来，帮我上马。”</p>
<p>So Blantyre helped her into the saddle，then climbed on me．Just as we were moving off，Lady Harriet asked for a message to be taken to Dr Ashley in the village．</p>
<p>布兰太尔只好帮她跨上马鞍，然后他骑上我。正当我们要出发时，哈丽埃特小姐来请我们带一封信给住在村子里的阿什莱大夫。</p>
<p>The village was about two kilometres away，and the doctor's house was the last one in it．Blantyre got off to open the gate for Lady Anne but she said，'I'll wait here for you．'</p>
<p>村子在两公里以外，医生的房子在尽头。布兰太尔下马去为安小姐开门，可是她说：“我在这儿等你。”</p>
<p>He went off and we waited．</p>
<p>他就一个人去了，我们在原地等着。</p>
<p>There was a field with an open gate on the opposite side of the road，and at that moment some young horses came trotting out．They were wild and excited，and there was a boy behind them，waving a large whip．Suddenly，one of the young horses ran across the road，and banged into Lizzie's back legs．She gave a violent kick，nearly unseating Lady Anne，and immedi－ately galloped away at full speed．</p>
<p>路对面有一块田地，大门是敞开的，有一些年青的马小跑着撒欢儿。他们野性十足，神情兴奋，有一个男孩挥舞着长鞭跟在后面。突然一匹马跑过公路，撞着了丽奇的后腿。她猛地尥了个蹶子，险些把安小姐掀下来，然后立刻开始全速狂奔。</p>
<p>I gave a loud neigh for help and made a noise with my feet until Mr Blantyre came running out of the doctor's house．He saw Lizzie and Lady Anne，now far away down the road，and quickly jumped into the saddle，and we raced after them．</p>
<p>我长嘶了一声，并用脚刨地发出声音，直到布兰太尔先生从医生家里跑出来。他看见了丽奇和安小姐，她们现在已经在路的尽头了。他立刻跳上马鞍，我们追了过去。</p>
<p>For about two kilometres the road was straight，then it turned to the right before becoming two roads．Long before we came to the bend，Lady Anne was out of sight．Which way had she gone？A woman was in her garden，looking up the road．'Which way？'shouted Blantyre．</p>
<p>有两公里的路是直的，然后右转，再分岔。我们离转弯还很远时，已经看不到安了。她走了哪条路呢？一个妇女站在她的花园中，抬头看着大道。“哪条路？”布兰太尔喊道。</p>
<p>'To the right！'cried the woman．</p>
<p>“右边！”妇女喊。</p>
<p>Away we went，up the right－hand road．We saw her for a moment，then she was gone again round another bend．Several times we saw her，but lost her again．Then we came to some rough land，very uneven and full of holes in the ground-the worst possible place for galloping．</p>
<p>我们转向右边的路。又看见她了，但接着她又在另一个弯道处消失了。有好几次我们看见了她，接着又看不见了。后来我们来到一片坑坑洼洼的地带，非常不平坦，地面上还有许多坑——是最不适合于疾驰的地方。</p>
<p>On this open ground we could now see Lady Anne clearly，her long hair flying out behind her in the wind，and slowly we began to catch up．There was a wide ditch ahead and I was sure it would stop them，but without a pause Lizzie jumped it—and fell．</p>
<p>在这片开阔地带，我们现在又能清楚地看到安小姐了，她的长发在背后飘扬在风中。慢慢地，我们赶了上去。前方有一条很宽的壕沟，我肯定那沟能截住他们，可是丽奇停也没停就跳了过去，然后摔倒在地上。</p>
<p>I cleared the ditch and landed safely．Lady Anne was lying on the ground，not moving．Blantyre jumped down beside her and called her name，but there was no reply．Her face was white and her eyes were closed．</p>
<p>我跃过壕沟并安全着地。安小姐躺在地上一动不动。布兰太尔跳下马蹲在她身旁叫着她的名字，可是没有回应。她脸色苍白，双眼紧闭。</p>
<p>'Annie，dear Annie，do speak！'he cried．</p>
<p>“安妮，亲爱的安妮，说话呀！”他喊着。</p>
<p>There were two men cutting grass close by and they saw Lizzie galloping away without a rider and came across．</p>
<p>近处有两个男人正在割草，他们看见背上无人的丽奇跑掉了，忙赶了过来。</p>
<p>'Can you ride？'Blantyre asked one of them．</p>
<p>“你会骑马吗？”布兰太尔问其中的一个。</p>
<p>'I'm not a good horseman，sir，'he said．'But I'll do my best．'</p>
<p>“我骑得不好，先生。”他说，“但我会尽力的。”</p>
<p>'Ride this horse to the doctor's and ask him to come imme－diately，then go on to the Hall，'said Blantyre．'Tell them all you know and ask them to send a carriage．'</p>
<p>“骑这匹马去医生那儿，叫他马上来，然后再去大宅，”布兰太尔说，“告诉他们你看到的一切，让他们带辆马车来。”</p>
<p>The man climbed into my saddle and we galloped off．I tried not to shake him about too much，and he soon discovered that he needed no whip．</p>
<p>那人上了我的鞍，我们就飞奔而去。我尽量不使他摇晃得太厉害，他也很快发现对我根本不需用鞭子。</p>
<p>There was a lot of excitement at the Hall when they heard what happened．I was put into my box，the saddle and bridle were taken off and a cloth was thrown over me．</p>
<p>家里的人听说了发生的事情，都非常震惊。我被带回马厩，马鞍和笼头被卸了下来，一块布扔了过来盖在我身上。</p>
<p>Two days later，Blantyre came and patted me．</p>
<p>两天后，布兰太尔过来拍了拍我。</p>
<p>'You did well，'he said．'I'm sure you knew Annie was in danger．She must ride only you from now on．'</p>
<p>“你干得不错，”他说，“我敢肯定当时你知道安妮有危险。从今往后只许她骑你。”</p>
<p>From this I knew that my young mistress was out of danger and would soon be able to ride again．</p>
<p>从这话我判断出我年轻的女主人已经脱离了危险，而且很快就可以骑马了。</p><a href='9.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
