<p><b>2 威尔士亲王 </b></p>
<p>In the spring of 1911 King George called Edward into his room and said：</p>
<p>1911年春天，乔治国王把爱德华叫到自己的房间，说：</p>
<p>'Next month I'll make you Prince of Wales and these are your clothes for the ceremony．'</p>
<p>“下个月我要封你为威尔士亲王，这是你要在典礼上穿的衣服。”</p>
<p>The King opened a small cupboard and Edward started to cry．'But father，'he said，'I'm sixteen years old now．I can't wear soft shoes and a skirt． I'll look like a girl． Why can't I dress like other people？'</p>
<p>国王打开一个小柜子，爱德华哭了起来。“可是父亲，”他说，“我现在已经16岁了。我不能穿软鞋和裙子。那会使我看上去像个女孩子。为什么我不能穿得像其他人一样？”</p>
<p>'Because you're different and special，'his father replied，'and one day you'll be King．'</p>
<p>“因为你和他们不一样，你是特别的，”他的父亲回答，“有朝一日你会成为国王。”</p>
<p>Edward cried for the next two days， but there was noth-ing he could do．</p>
<p>接下来的两天，爱德华哭个不停，但他没有办法。</p>
<p>And so， on 10th June 1911， the family drove to Caernar－von Castle in North Wales and the ceremony began．</p>
<p>就这样，1911年6月10日，王室成员驱车前往北威尔士的卡那封城堡，典礼开始了。</p>
<p>The King put a small gold crown on Edward's head．There was music and dancing and the crowd began to shout．</p>
<p>国王把一顶小号的金冠戴在爱德华的头上。现场有音乐和舞蹈，人群欢呼起来。</p>
<p>The new Prince of Wales closed his eyes．'I feel terrible，' he said．'Can we go home now？'</p>
<p>而新封的威尔士亲王却闭上了眼睛。“我觉得很难受，”他说，“现在我们可以回家了吗？”</p>
<p>'Not yet，' the King replied．'The people want to see you．</p>
<p>“还不能，”国王回答，“人们想看看你。”</p>
<p>Edward walked to the front of the castle and looked down at the crowd．He was shaking and his face was red．</p>
<p>爱德华走到城堡前部，俯视人群。他浑身颤抖，脸涨得通红。</p>
<p>'Smile， Edward，'the King said．'You are happy！'</p>
<p>“笑一笑，爱德华，”国王说，“你应该高兴！”</p>
<p>A few hours later the family were driving back to Windsor．'Wasn't that a lovely day！'Queen Mary said．</p>
<p>几小时后，全家人驱车回到温莎。“多么愉快的一天呀！”玛丽王后说。</p>
<p>Edward took off his shoes and looked out of the window．'Never again，'he thought． 'Never again！'</p>
<p>爱德华脱下鞋子，向窗外望去。“我再也不要这样了，”他想，“永远不！”</p><a href='4.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
