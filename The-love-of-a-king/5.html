<p><b>4 相识 </b></p>
<p>In the autumn of 1930 Edward went to stay with his friends Lord and Lady Furness．This is how he described that weekend in a book called A King's Story：</p>
<p>1930年的秋天，爱德华去他的朋友弗内斯勋爵夫妇那里小祝在《一个国王的故事》一书中，他是这样描述那个周末的：</p>
<p>On Saturday the weather was cold and windy．It was raining heavily so we could not ride our horses． We decided to stay in the house and have an early lunch with some of Lady Furness' friends．</p>
<p>星期六，天气很冷，刮着风。雨下得很大，所以我们无法出去骑马。我们决定待在屋里，早点开午饭。与我们共进午餐的是弗内斯勋爵夫人的一些朋友。</p>
<p>At one o'clock Wallis arrived with her husband． She was beautifully dressed and she smiled all the time．She spoke with Lord Furness for a few minutes，and then Lady Fur－ness brought her over to see me．</p>
<p>1点钟，沃利斯和她的丈夫来了。她穿得很漂亮，始终面带微笑。她与弗内斯勋爵夫人谈了几分钟，然后弗内斯勋爵夫人把她带到我面前。</p>
<p>'Sir，I would like you to meet one of my dearest and sweetest American friends，Mrs Wallis Simpson．'</p>
<p>“殿下，我想介绍您认识我的一位最可爱、最甜美的美国朋友，沃利斯&middot;辛普森夫人。”</p>
<p>'How do you do， Mrs Simpson，'I said．'Please come and sit down．'</p>
<p>“您好，辛普森夫人，”我说，“请过来坐坐。”</p>
<p>Lady Furness left us and we began to talk．</p>
<p>弗内斯勋爵夫人走开了，我们交谈起来。</p>
<p>I could see that Wallis was not felling very well．She had a bad cold and her eyes were red． 'I'm afraid that our English houses aren't very warm，'I said． 'We don't have American central heating here．'</p>
<p>我看得出，沃利斯不太舒服。她得了重感冒，眼睛红红的。“恐怕我们英国的房子不够暖和，”我说，“我们这儿没有美国的中央供暖系统。”</p>
<p>There was a long silence．Mrs Simpson turned her face and looked out of the window．Then she said：'You have disappointed me，Sir．'</p>
<p>接着是长长的一段沉默。辛普森夫人转头向窗外望去。然后她说：“您让我感到失望，殿下。”</p>
<p>'And why is that？'I asked．</p>
<p>“为什么？”我问。</p>
<p>'Because everybody asks me about American central heat－ing．I thought that the Prince of Wales would talk about something more interesting．'</p>
<p>“因为每个人都问我美国中央供暖的事儿。我想，威尔士亲王准会谈些比较有趣的事。”</p>
<p>I began to laugh．</p>
<p>我大笑起来。</p>
<p>'What's the matter，Sir？'Wallis asked．'Have I said something wrong？'</p>
<p>“怎么了，殿下？”沃利斯问，“我说错什么了吗？”</p>
<p>'No，'I replied．'I'm laughing because you didn't lie to me．You told me the truth．'</p>
<p>“没有，”我回答，“我笑是因为你没对我说谎。你讲了真话。”</p>
<p>'But why is that funny？ Doesn't everybody do that？'</p>
<p>“可这有什么可笑的？难道大家不都这样吗？”</p>
<p>'One day I'll be King of England，' I replied．'And people are afraid of me．If I say that the sky is yellow， they say，“Yes，Sir，you are right”． If I say that Wednesday is the first day of the week， they say，“Yes，Sir，you are right”． And if I say that Scotland is bigger than Canada，they say， “Yes，Sir，you are right”．But you told me that I was boring！ You told me the truth．I like that！'</p>
<p>“有朝一日我会成为英国的国王，”我答道，“所以人们都怕我。如果我说天是黄的，他们会说，'对，殿下，您说得对'。如果我说星期三是一周里的第一天，他们会说，'对，殿下，您说得对'。如果我说苏格兰比加拿大还要大，他们会说，'对，殿下，你说得对'。可是，您却告诉我，我令人乏味！您讲了真心话。我喜欢这样！”</p>
<p>There was another silence and then Wallis began to laugh．'Can I say one more thing，Sir？'</p>
<p>又是一段沉默，然后沃利斯笑了起来。“我能再说一件事吗，殿下？”</p>
<p>'Yes， Mrs Simpson，what is it？'</p>
<p>“可以，辛普森夫人，什么事？”</p>
<p>'It's your trousers，Sir．'</p>
<p>“是您的裤子，殿下。”</p>
<p>'My trousers？'</p>
<p>“我的裤子？”</p>
<p>'Yes， Sir．They are black and your shoes are brown．'These two colours don't look right together．'</p>
<p>“是的，殿下。您的裤子是黑色的，鞋却是棕色的。这两种颜色配在一起有点儿不协调。”</p>
<p>I stood up and looked in the mirror．'Yes，Mrs Simp－son，you're right．I look very strange．The next time we meet，I will be better dressed．'</p>
<p>我站起身，照了照镜子。“不错，辛普森夫人，您说得对。我看上去真奇怪。等我们下次见面时，我会穿得更得体些。”</p>
<p>When lunch was ready，we walked through into the dining room．I sat at one end of the table and Wallis sat at the other end．I was watching her very carefully．I thought how beautiful her hands were．She began talking to Lady Furness and then， a few minutes later， she turned and smiled at me．I felt very happy．</p>
<p>午餐准备好了，我们走进餐厅。我坐在桌子一头，沃利斯坐在另一头。我仔细地打量她。我想，她的手多美呀！她开始和弗内斯勋爵夫人谈话，几分钟后，她转过头来向我微笑。我觉得很高兴。</p>
<p>After lunch Wallis came over to say goodbye．'My hus－band and I have to leave now，Sir．We're going to another party in London．'</p>
<p>午餐后，沃利斯过来向我道别。“我和我丈夫现在得走了，殿下。我们要去伦敦参加另一个聚会。”</p>
<p>I wanted to speak to her but I could not find the right words．I don't know why． We shook hands and Wallis walked away．</p>
<p>我想对她说点什么，可一时找不到合适的话。我不懂为什么会这样。我们握了握手，沃利斯走了。</p>
<p>I went into the next room and sat down near Lady Fur－ness．'Tell me about Mrs Simpson，'I said．</p>
<p>我走到隔壁房间里，坐在弗内斯夫人身旁。“给我讲讲辛普森夫人的事。”我说。</p>
<p>'What would you like to know？'she asked．</p>
<p>“您想知道什么？”她问。</p>
<p>'Everything！' I said．</p>
<p>“她的一切！”我说。</p>
<p>'Then perhaps，Sir，you would like to walk in the gar－den．We can talk more freely there．'</p>
<p>“那样的话，殿下，也许您会愿意去花园里走走。我们在那儿谈起来会比较自由些。”</p>
<p>We stood up and left the house by the back door．We walked slowly through the trees，and Lady Furness told me about Wallis…</p>
<p>我们起身从后门走出去。我们漫步在树丛中，弗内斯夫人给我讲起了沃利斯的事……</p><a href='6.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
