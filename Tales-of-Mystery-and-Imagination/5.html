<p><b>泄密的心 </b></p>
<p>It is true that I had been-and I am -very nervous，but do you really think that I am mad ? I could see and hear more clearly7-not less ,because of the disease． My hearing，more than anything，was excellent． I could hear all things，things in this world and things in heaven． I heard many things，things in this world and things in heaven ． I heard many things in hell，too． So how can I be mad ? See how clearly and calmly I can tell my story．</p>
<p>的确，我过去——现在也是——极端神经过敏，但是，你们真地觉得我发疯了吗？因为得了这病，我看东西和听东西都比以往更清楚了——而不是相反。尤其我的听觉，简直好极了。我什么都听得见，无论是这世界上的声音还是天堂的声音。好多地狱里的声音我也听得见。那么，我怎么会是发了疯呢？瞧，我讲述自己的故事的时候是多么有条理，多么镇静埃</p>
<p>I cannot explain how the idea first came into my head． But once I had thought of the idea，I could not forget it． I had no reason to do it ． I was not angry． I loved the old man ．H e had never hurt me in any way ． I didn't want his gold． I think it was his eye! Yes! He had a pale，blue eye，the eye of a vulture． Whenever I looked at it ,my blo0od became cold; and so ,very slowly，I decided to kill the old man and escape from the eye for ever．</p>
<p>我难以解释清楚那个念头起初是如何出现在我脑际的，但我一旦有了那个念头，便不能将其忘记了。我干那件事毫无道理。我并不愤怒，我喜欢那个老头，他从来就没什么地方冒犯过我。我也不贪图他的金银财宝。我想，起因是他的眼睛！是的！他长了一只发白的蓝眼睛，一只鹰眼。无论我何时见了那只眼睛，我浑身的血液就要变得冰冷；于是，渐渐地，我打定了主意要杀掉那老头，从此永远摆脱那只眼睛。</p>
<p>You are thinking ,I know，that I am mad ． But madmen are not clever． And see how cleverly I prepared my plan! Every day that week I was so kind to the old man ! And every night of that week，at about midnight，I opened his door very，very quietly． First I put my dark lantern through the opening of the door． The lantern was closed，and so no light came out of it ,none at all ． Then slowly，very slowly，I put my head inside the opening． I took sixty long minutes just to put my head inside． Would a madman have worked so carefully? And when my head was inside the room，I opened the lantern carefully and a thin ray of light fell onto the vulture eye． But the eye was always closed，so I could not do the work．You see，I did not hate the man; it was only the eye that I hated．</p>
<p>我知道，诸位在想，我准是发了疯。然而疯子可没这么机灵。瞧啊，我准备我的计划时干得有多聪明！那个礼拜的每一天我待那老头有多好！那个礼拜的每天夜里，大概是午夜时分，我都要非常非常轻地打开他的房门。首先，我把我那熄了火的提灯伸进门开处。提灯已经关灭了，于是没有任何光亮发出，一丝儿也没有。然后，慢慢地，极慢地，我把头伸进门开处我花了长长的六十分钟，就为了伸进一个脑袋。一个疯子做事情有这么小心翼翼吗？我把脑袋伸到了屋子里面之后，便小心地拧开提灯，让一道微弱的光线落在那只鹰眼上。但是那只眼睛总是合着，所以我没法下手。你们看见了，我并不恨那人；我恨的仅仅是那只眼睛。</p>
<p>On the eighth night I started opening the door even more carefully．I was feeling calm and strong．There I was，opening his door，and he did not even know that I was there! I almost laughed at the idea． And perhaps，at that moment，he heard me，because he suddenly moved in his bed But I did not move away． I knew that he could not see the opening of the door，so I continued pushing it open，slowly and quietly．</p>
<p>第八天夜里，我去开房门时更为小心谨慎。我感觉很平静，很强壮。我在这儿开着他的房门，可他甚至根本不知道我的存在！我差点儿因为这个念头笑出声来。不过，说不定他这时候听见了我的动静，因为他忽然在床上动了一下。但我并未走开。我知道他看不见开着的门缝，于是继续慢慢地、悄悄地把门推开。</p>
<p>When my head was in the room，I tried to open the lantern but my thumb slipped and I made a noise．Immediately，the man sat up in bed and shouted，‘Who's there?’</p>
<p>我把脑袋伸进屋子，想把提灯拧开，但大拇指滑了一卜，弄出了一点声响。床上那人立即坐起身，喝问道：“是谁？”</p>
<p>I said nothing．For an hour I just stood there，without moving，and he sat in his bed，listening．Then he made a soft noise，a noise which I recognized． It was the noise of terror，the terror of death．I knew the sound because I had made it myself，many times，in the deep of the night，when all the world was asleep I felt sorry for the old man，but I laughed silently．I knew that he had been awake since the first noise，and his fear had grown and grown．Death had entered his room，and now the shadow of deatn lay all around him． He could neither see me nor hear me，but he could feel my head inside his room．</p>
<p>我没有吱声。有一个钟头的工夫，我就在那儿站着，一动不动；而他则坐在床上，侧耳倾听。然后他轻轻地发出了一个声音。我听出了这声音的含义，这是一种恐惧的声音，恐惧死亡的声音。我之所以能够理解这种声音，是因为我自己也曾发出过好多次，当夜深人静、万籁俱寂的时候。我为那老头感到难过，但又不禁暗笑。我知道，自打第一个动静响起，他就已经醒了，他内心的恐惧已经越升越高。死神已经进了他的屋子，现在，死亡的阴影已在他四周布满。他既看不见我也听不见我，但他能感觉到我的脑袋已伸进了他的屋子。</p>
<p>I opened the lantern a little and a thin ray of light feel on his eye．It was open，and as I looked at it，I became angry．I could see it clearly，a horrible，pale blue eye that turned my blood cold． I could see nothing of the man's face or body，just his eye．</p>
<p>我把提灯稍稍拧亮一点，一道微弱的光线照在他的那只眼睛上。它是睁开的。我一看见它，便心头火起。我能够清晰地看见它，一只可怖的淡蓝色眼睛，能让我的血液变得冰冷。那人的脸庞或是身体我都看不见了，能看见的只有这只眼睛。</p>
<p>And then I heard a sound．Hadn't I told you that my hearing was excellent? I knew the sound．It was the beating of the old man's heart．It grew louder and quicker．Yes，louder and louder with every minute．The old man's terror must have been very great． And now a new terror came to me-a neighbour might hear the noise of this beating heart! The old man's time had come!</p>
<p>然后我听到一声响动。我不是对你们说过我的听觉极为灵敏吗？我知道这声音是什么。是老头的心跳声。他的心越跳越快，声音越来越大。没错，每分钟都愈发大起来了。那老头一定是处于极度的恐惧之中。而现在，一种新的恐惧降临到了我身上——哪个邻居会听见这种怦怦的心跳声！老头的时辰到啦！</p>
<p>I opened the lantern fully and ran into the room．He shouted once-but only once because I pulled him to the floor and pulled the heavy bed over him． For many minutes the heart continued to beat，but then it stopped．The old man was dead．I put my hand on his heart and held it there for many minutes．There was no life in him at all．Now his eye would not trouble me again．</p>
<p>我将提灯彻底拧亮，冲进屋子。他尖叫了一声——但只叫了那么一声，因为我把他拖到了地板上，又拽过沉甸甸的床压在他身上。那颗心接着又跳了好几分钟，但然后就停住了。老头死了。我把手按在他胸口，就那样放了好几分钟。他已经彻底没气儿了，现在，他的眼睛再也不会困扰我了。</p>
<p>Perhaps you are still thinking that I am mad．You will not，when I tell you of way I hid the body．First，I cut it into pieces． I cut off the head and the arms and the legs． I then took up three boards from the wooden floor，and hid the body underneath．Finally，I replaced the wooden boards with great care．Now no human eye-not even his- would see anything wrong．There was nothing to see-not even any blood．A bowl had caught it all-ha! ha!</p>
<p>也许你们仍然在想我是疯了。要是我告诉你们我用了多么聪明的办法藏匿尸体，你们就不会这样想了。首先，我把尸体切成几块。我把脑袋、胳膊和双腿都割了下来。然后，我从木质地板上揭起三块板子来，把尸体藏在下面。最后，我加倍小心地将木板重新放好。现在，没有哪只人的眼睛——哪怕是他的眼睛——会看出有什么破绽了。没什么能看出来的——连一丝血迹都没有。一只碗就把血全盛下了——哈！哈！</p>
<p>When I finished，it was four o'clock and it was still dark．There was a knock at the front door．Calmly，because I knew I had nothing to fear，I opened the door．Three policemen came in．They had come because a neighbour had reported a loud shout coming from the house．</p>
<p>我干完这一切，已是凌晨4点钟，天还黑着。前门传来一阵敲门声。我知道自己没什么好怕的，便镇静地打开了门。进来了三个警察，他们到这里来是因为一个邻居报警，说是听见这所房子里传出了一声尖叫。</p>
<p>I welcomed the policemen and asked them to come in． I explained that it was I who had shouted，in a dream．The old man，I said，was away in the country．I took them round the house and asked them to search it well．Then I took them to the old man's room and showed them all his things．I brought chairs into the room and invited them to sit down and rest a while Calmly，I put my own chair on the place where I had hidden his body．</p>
<p>我向警察们表示欢迎，请他们进屋来。我解释说，那声尖叫是我在梦中喊出来的，又说，那个老头出门到乡下去了。我领着他们在房子里转了一遍，要他们好好地搜查一番。然后我又把他们带到老头的屋子，给他们看老头的全部家当。我搬了几把椅子进来，请他们坐下休息片刻，又镇定自若地把我自己的椅子放在我藏匿老头尸体的地方。</p>
<p>The policemen seemed happy．They could see from the way I spoke that all was well．They continued talking，but I began to get tired．My head ached，and there was a ringing noise in my ears．I wanted the men to go away，but they continued to talk．The ringing became louder and clearer．And then I realized that the noise was not in my ears．</p>
<p>警察们似乎很满意，他们可以从我的言谈举止中看出一切都很正常。他们继续说着话，可我却有点不耐烦了。我头直疼，耳中嗡嗡作响。我想让这几个人走开，可他们没完没了地聊着天。嗡嗡的轰鸣声变得更响亮、更清楚了。这时，我意识到这声音不是响在我的耳朵里。</p>
<p>I became very pale，and starting talking more loudly．But the noise became louder too． What could do? It was a low，soft sound，like the sound made by a watch when it is covered in cotton．I spoke more loudly．The noise became louder too．Why，oh why，didn't the men go away? I walked up and down the room． I became angry，I argued，I threw the chair onto the floor．But the noise continued to grow louder，louder than every noise I made．And the men went on talking and smiling．Was it possible that they hadn't heard the terrible noise? No! no! They heard! They knew! They were only pretending that they hadn't heard the noise! I was sure of this-I still am and I hated their smiling faces．I felt that I must scream or die! And now，again，the noise was louder，louder，louder!</p>
<p>我脸色煞白，开始提高了嗓门说话。但那声音也愈来愈大了。我能怎么办？那是一种低沉、柔和的声音，像是用棉花捂住了手表发出的声响。我把嗓门提得更高。那声音也随之变大了。为什么，噢为什么那几个人还不走呢？我在屋子里踱来踱去。我生起气来，争辩着，把椅子往地板上摔。但那声音一刻不停地越升越高，盖过了我制造出的种种噪声。那几个人继续说着、笑着。他们可能没听见那可怕的声音吗？不！不！他们听见了！他们全知道了！他们只是装作没听见那声音！我敢肯定这一点——现在仍然肯定。还有，我讨厌他们那副微笑的面孔。我觉得自己必须尖叫了，否则就会死去！现在，又来了，那声音越来越大，越来越大，越来越大！</p>
<p>'Stop! 'I shouted．'Stop pretending that you cannot hear it! Yes，I did it! Pull up the floorboards here! here，here!-it is the beating of his horrible heart!'</p>
<p>“得了！”我嚷道。“别再装作你们听不见了！不错，是我干的！把这儿的地板揭起来吧！这儿！这儿，这儿！——是他那颗可恶的心在跳！”</p></body></html>
