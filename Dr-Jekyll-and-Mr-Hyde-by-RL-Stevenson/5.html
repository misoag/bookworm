<p><b>5 朋友之死 </b></p>
<p>Time passed．The search for Mr Hyde continued．SirDanvers Carew was an important and popular man andthe police tried desperately to arrest the murderer and bringhim to trial．But there was no sign of Mr Hyde himself， although the police and the newspapers discovered a lot about hispast life．Nobody，it seemed，could say one good word aboutthe wanted man． He was a cruel， violent man， who had livedan evil life full of hate and jealousy．None of this， however，was any help to the police． Mr Hyde had just disappeared．</p>
<p>时间一天天过去了，搜寻海德的工作还在继续。丹佛斯&middot;卡鲁爵士是个引人注目的重要人物，警方也竭力想抓住凶手，绳之以法。尽管警方和新闻界找出了很多海德以前的事，但还是没有他的影子。而且没有人说通缉犯的好话。他是个残酷、暴烈的人，生活在邪恶里，充满了仇恨和嫉妒。可是所有这些，没一样对警察有帮助，海德先生就那么销声匿迹了。</p>
<p>As time went by， Mr Utterson became calmer and more atpeace with himself． He was truly sorry that his client， SirDanvers Carew， was dead， but he was also very glad that MrHyde had disappeared． As for Doctor Jekyll， he too appearedcalmer and happier．He came out into the world again．He invited friends to his house and accepted invitations to theirs． Hehad always been a good and generous man．Now，however，hebecame a churchgoer too． He was busy， he spent a lot of timein the fresh air and he looked happy and carefree．For morethan two months he was at peace with himself and the world．</p>
<p>光阴流逝，厄特森先生慢慢镇定下来，感到比较安心了。他的确为死去的委托人卡鲁爵士难过，但同时也很高兴海德不见了。杰基尔博士也变得比以前安心、快乐了，他又开始了新生活，回到了人世间。他请朋友到家里做客，也接受朋友们的邀请，他以前就非常仁慈和慷慨，现在还居然成了教堂的常客。他很忙，整天在户外的新鲜空气里呆着，兴高采烈，逍遥自在。有两个月的时间，博士生活得很安宁。</p>
<p>On the 8th of January Mr Utterson was invited to dinner atDoctor Jekyll's house．Doctor Lanyon was there too．'This isquite like old times，'thought the lawyer as he watched DoctorJekyll smiling at Doctor Lanyon．</p>
<p>1月8日，厄特森先生应邀去杰基尔博士家赴宴，兰宁医生也在。“又像回到了过去的时光，”律师一边望着博士冲着医生微笑，一边想着。</p>
<p>On January 12th，however，and again on the 14th， DoctorJekyll refused to see visitors．</p>
<p>可到了1月12日，接着14日，杰基尔博士又拒绝会客了。</p>
<p>'The doctor is not well，'explained Poole．'He hopes youwill forgive him，but he cannot see anyone．'</p>
<p>“博士不舒服，”普尔解释说，“他希望您能原谅他，他谁也不见。”</p>
<p>Mr Utterson called again next day， and again the day afterthat．After two months of almost daily meetings with his oldfriend，the lawyer felt rather lonely．On the sixth evening heinvited his clerk，Mr Guest，to dinner with him， and on theseventh night he went to visit Doctor Lanyon．</p>
<p>厄特森先生第二天又去了，随后几天也去了。两个月以来，他几乎天天与老朋友见面，现在律师感到莫名地孤独。第六天晚上，他留助手盖斯特先生吃饭，第七天夜里，他去见了兰宁医生。</p>
<p>Doctor Lanyon made him welcome，but Mr Utterson wasshocked by the change in the doctor's appearance．His face，which was usually pink and healthy， was grey and thin， andthere was a frightened look in his eyes． He was suddenly anold，sick man．</p>
<p>兰宁医生倒没有不欢迎他，但看到他的样子，厄特森先生不禁大吃一惊。他以前脸色又红润又健康，可现在却灰白而消瘦，而且他的眼睛里透着深深的惊恐，一下子变成了一个衰老、病危的人。</p>
<p>'He looks，'said Mr Utterson to himself，'like a man whoknows he's dying．'</p>
<p>“他那副样子，”厄特森先生心想，“就像知道自己死期将至一样。”</p>
<p>'How are you，Lanyon？'he said．'You don't look well．'</p>
<p>“怎么了，兰宁？”他问，“你气色不大好。”</p>
<p>'I've had a shock，Utterson，'replied Doctor Lanyon．'Andit will cause my death．I have only a few weeks to live．'Hepaused．'Well，it comes to us all sooner or later． I've had agood life， on the whole．'</p>
<p>“厄特森，我受了次惊吓，”兰宁医生答道，“我活不长了，只是几个星期的事。”他顿了顿，又说：“唉，人终有一死，这是迟早的事，不管怎么说，我的一生还算不错。”</p>
<p>'Jekyll is ill too，'said the lawyer．'Have you seen him？'</p>
<p>“杰基尔也病了，”律师说，“你见过他吗？”</p>
<p>At the name of Jekyll the look on Doctor Lanyon's face changed．'Please，'he said， holding up a trembling hand，'don't speak that name in this house．'</p>
<p>一听到杰基尔的名字，兰宁医生神色大变，举起一只颤抖的手。“我求求你，”他说，“别在我这里提那个名字。”</p>
<p>'Oh dear，'said Mr Utterson．He hesitated for a moment．'The three of us have been friends all our lives，Lanyon．Weare too old now to make new friends．Can't you forgive andforget？Perhaps I can help？'</p>
<p>“哦，天哪！”厄特森先生说。停了好一会儿，他又问道：“兰宁，我们三个做了一辈子朋友，我们老了，不会再有新的朋友了，你难道不能原谅和忘掉他的过失吗？也许我能帮点忙？”</p>
<p>'Nothing can be done，'replied Doctor Lanyon．'Ask himyourself．'</p>
<p>“无济于事。”兰宁回答说，“你问他自己吧。”</p>
<p>'He won't let me into the house．'</p>
<p>“他不让我进门。”</p>
<p>'That doesn't surprise me， One day，Utterson， after I amdead，you will perhaps learn the full story． Meanwhile， if youcan sit and talk to me of other things， please stay． Just don't mention that person， as it hurts me to think about him．'</p>
<p>“我也料到了。总有一天，厄特森，等我死了，你会知道事情的真相的。再有，要是愿意坐下来和我说点别的。那就请留下来，别提那个人，一想到他，我就难受。”</p>
<p>As soon as he got home， Mr Utterson wrote to DoctorJekyll．In his letter he asked why Jekyll refused to let him intohis house，and why he and Doctor Lanyon were no longerfriendly．The reply was long and not always easy to understand．</p>
<p>厄特森先生一回到家，就坐下来给杰基尔博士写信，问他为什么拒绝见自己，为什么和兰宁医生断交了。他收到了回信，写得又长又令人费解。</p>
<p>'I'm not angry with our old friend，'Doctor Jekyll wrote，'but I agree with him that the two of us must never meetagain．Meanwhile，you must forgive me if from now on I livea very quiet life． If you find my door closed to you，it's because I must travel this dark，dangerous road alone． I havedone wrong and I'm being punished for it，and nobody canhelp me．'</p>
<p>“我不责怪咱们的老朋友，”杰基尔博士写道，“但我同意他的看法，我们不能再见面了。还有也请你原谅，从现在起我要过一种与世隔绝的生活。我的门对你关上，是因为我必须独自踏上这条危险而又黑暗的路程。我已经做了错事，并为此受到惩罚，没人能帮助我。”</p>
<p>'What is this？'thought Mr Utterson．'Hyde has disappeared．Jekyll is his normal self again—at least，he was untillast week． Has he gone mad？'Then he remembered DoctorLanyon's words．'There is something more，'he said to himself，'something mysterious， but I have no idea what it is．'</p>
<p>“这是怎么回事？”厄特森先生想，“海德已经消失了，杰基尔也恢复了原来的老样子——至少上周还是这样。难道他疯了？”接着他想起了兰宁医生的话。“这里面有问题，”他自言自语道，“有哪儿不对劲，可我猜不出有什么秘密。”</p>
<p>A week later Doctor Lanyon was too ill to leave his bed．Two weeks after that he was dead． After his friend's burial，Mr Utterson went home and into his office．From his lockedcupboard he took out an envelope， which he had received soonafter his friend' s death．</p>
<p>一星期后，兰宁医生已经卧床不起，又过了两个星期，他就去世了。葬礼过后，厄特森先生回到家，走进自己的办公室，打开锁，从柜子里拿出一个信封，是朋友死后不久他收到的。</p>
<p>In Doctor Lanyon's handwriting he read 'G．J．Utterson．Private．'The lawyer turned the envelope over and over in hishands before he opened it．What terrible news could itcontain？ With trembling hands Mr Utterson opened the envelope． Inside was another envelope， with the words'Not to beopened until the death or disappearance of Doctor HenryJekyll．'</p>
<p>是兰宁医生的笔迹，他读道：“加&middot;约&middot;厄特森亲启，私人密件。”律师拿着信封，在手里翻来复去地看着。里面会有什么可怕的消息呢？厄特森先生两手颤抖着拆开了信封，里面还有一个信封，写着：“到亨利&middot;杰基尔博士死亡或失踪时方可拆阅。”</p>
<p>The lawyer could not believe his eyes．'Death or disappearance'— the words were the same as in Doctor Jekyll's will．'Iunderstand why Jekyll wrote those words，'said Mr Uttersonto himself．'But why did Lanyon write them too？'For a moment he wanted to open the envelope and uncover the mysterythere and then． But Mr Utterson was too honest a man and alawyer to do that． He knew he must obey his friend's andclient's last wish． He locked the envelope away in his cupboard beside Doctor Jekyll's will．</p>
<p>律师简直不敢相信自己的眼睛，“死亡或失踪时”，这个说法和杰基尔博士本人的那份遗嘱上的一模一样。“我理解为什么杰基尔会写这些话，”他自言自语道，“但为什么兰宁写得也是这样的话呢？”有那么一个瞬间，他真想拆开信，马上揭开这些秘密。但他是个非常诚实、正直的律师，不会那么做的，他一定要遵从朋友和委托人的遗愿。他又把这封信锁进柜子里，放在杰基尔博士的遗嘱旁边。</p>
<p>The lawyer was desperately worried about his friend DoctorJekyll． He was afraid for him too． He called at the house butthe doctor always refused to see him．</p>
<p>律师为自己的朋友杰基尔博士感到十分担心，甚至为他感到害怕。他又去了博士家，但仍被拒之门外。</p>
<p>'How is he，Poole？'Mr Utterson asked the old servant oneday．</p>
<p>“普尔，他还好吗？”有一天他问老仆人。</p>
<p>'Not very well，sir．He spends all his time in the studyabove his laboratory．He sleeps there as well． He seems verysilent and uneasy． Something is worrying him， sir，but hewon't tell anyone．'</p>
<p>“不太好，先生。他整天关在实验室楼上的书房里，甚至还睡在那儿。他话很少，总是闷闷不乐的，肯定出了什么事，先生，可他谁也不告诉。”</p>
<p>For a long time the lawyer called almost every day． Little bylittle，however， he became tired of his friend's refusal to seehim， and his visits became less frequent．</p>
<p>有好长一段时间，律师几乎天天去看他，但渐渐地，他对朋友拒绝见自己感到心灰意冷了，来访的次数也越来越少了。</p><a href='6.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
