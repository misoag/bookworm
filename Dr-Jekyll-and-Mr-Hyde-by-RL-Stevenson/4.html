<p><b>4 杰基尔博士收到一封信 </b></p>
<p>Later that same afternoon Mr Utterson found his way toDoctor Jekyll's house．Jekyll's servant， Poole， let himin at once and took him through the kitchen and across theback garden to the laboratory behind the house．It was thefirst time that Mr Utterson had seen his friend's laboratory，and he looked around curiously．</p>
<p>当天下午很晚了，厄特森先生才抽出空去杰基尔博士家。博士的仆人普尔马上把他让进去，穿过厨房和后花园来到屋后面的实验室，这是厄特森先生第一次到朋友的实验室来，他好奇地看来看去。</p>
<p>The old servant led Mr Utterson through the laboratory andup some stairs to the doctor's private study above．This was alarge room with tall， glass－fronted cupboards， a large mirrorand a big，businesslike table．A good fire burned in the fireplace and beside it sat Doctor Jekyll， looking white and ill． Ina thin， tired voice he welcomed his friend．</p>
<p>老仆人带他经过实验室，上楼来到博士的私人书房。屋子很大，周围都是镶着玻璃的柜子，还有一面大镜子和一张井然有序的大办公桌。壁炉里火烧得很旺，火边坐着杰基尔博士，面色苍白，十分痛苦的样子。他声音微弱、无精打来地和朋友打了招呼。</p>
<p>'Have you heard the news？'said Mr Utterson after the oldservant had left．</p>
<p>“你也听说这事了？”老仆人刚一退下，厄特森先生就问。</p>
<p>'The newsboys were shouting about it in the street，'DoctorJekyll said．'A terrible business．'</p>
<p>“报童满街叫喊，”杰基尔说，“这太可怕了。”</p>
<p>'Let me ask you something，'said the lawyer．'Sir DanversCarew was my client， but you are my client too，and I want toknow what I'm doing．You haven't tried to hide the murderer， have you？'</p>
<p>“我要问你些事，”律师说，“丹佛斯&middot;卡鲁是我的委托人，但你也是，我要知道自己该如何行事。你不会想把凶手藏起来吧？”</p>
<p>'Utterson，I promise you，'cried the doctor，'I promise youI'll never see him again． I've finished with him for ever． Andnow， indeed， he no longer needs my help．You don't knowhim like I do． He's safe， quite safe．Believe me，nobody willever hear of Hyde again．'</p>
<p>“厄特森，我向你保证，”博士喊道，“我保证再也不见他了，我已跟他一刀两断了。实际上他也不需要我的帮助了。我了解他，你不了解，他现在很安全，非常安全。相信我，没人会再见到海德了。”</p>
<p>The lawyer listened with a serious face． He did not like hisfriend's feverish， excited look．</p>
<p>律师听着，一脸的严肃，他不喜欢博士那发热病似的兴奋神态。</p>
<p>'You seem very sure of him，'he replied．'I hope you'reright．If he is caught and comes to trial，your name may bementioned．'</p>
<p>“看起来你对他挺放心，”他答道，“希望你是对的，要是抓住了他，弄到法庭上，你的名字也会被提出来的。”</p>
<p>'I'm absolutely sure of him，' answered Jekyll．' I can't tellyou how I know，but I'm certain． But can you please adviseme about one thing？I've received a letter and I don't knowwhether to show it to the police．May I leave it in your hands，Utterson？'</p>
<p>“我对他的确有把握，”杰基尔回答说，“我不能告诉你为什么，但我的确放心。可有一件事我要请教一下，我刚收到一封信，我不知道是否应该交给警方，厄特森，我交给你，好吗？”</p>
<p>'You're afraid，I suppose， that the letter will lead the police to Hyde？'asked the lawyer．</p>
<p>“我想，你是不是怕这封信会让警方追踪到海德？”律师问。</p>
<p>'No，'said Doctor Jekyll．'I don't care what happens toHyde．I was thinking of my own reputation… Anyway，here is the letter．'</p>
<p>“不，”杰基尔博士说，“我倒不在乎海德会怎样。我担心的是自己的名声……不管怎么说，这就是那封信。”</p>
<p>It was written in a strange，pointed handwriting and signed'Edward Hyde'．'I am sorry that I have been so ungrateful inthe past for your many generous acts，'it began．'Please don't worry about me．I am quite safe and I am certain that I can escape unharmed whenever I wish．'</p>
<p>这封信笔迹奇特，线条直愣愣的，签名是“爱德华&middot;海德”。信开头写道：“很久以来承蒙您恩眷，沾沐厚泽，无以为报；实为遗憾。请您不必为我担心，我十分安全，肯定会毫发无损地逃出去，任我遨游。”</p>
<p>'Did this letter come by post？'asked the lawyer．</p>
<p>“信是邮差送来的吗？”律师问。</p>
<p>'No，'replied Doctor Jekyll．'There was no postmark on theenvelope．The letter came by hand．'</p>
<p>“不是，”博士回答道，“信封上没有邮戳，是打发人直接送来的。”</p>
<p>'Shall I keep the letter and think about it？'asked Mr Utterson．</p>
<p>“让我先拿着信，再想想？”律师问。</p>
<p>'I want you to decide for me，'answered his client．'I' mnot sure of anything any more．'</p>
<p>“希望你能代我作全盘考虑，”他的委托人说，“我已经没有自信了。”</p>
<p>'Very well，'said the lawyer．'Now tell me—the part inyour will about disappearing for three months or more． Wasthat Hyde's idea？'</p>
<p>“那好吧。”律师说，“还有一句话，遗嘱里有关你失踪三个月的条款，也是海德的主意吗？”</p>
<p>'It was，'whispered Doctor Jekyll．</p>
<p>博士轻轻叹了口气：“是的。”</p>
<p>'He was planning to murder you，'said the lawyer．'You've had a lucky escape．'</p>
<p>“他想杀害你，”律师说，“幸亏你死里逃生。”</p>
<p>'I've had a lesson too，'said his client， in pain and sadness．'Oh， what a lesson！' And he covered his face with his hands．</p>
<p>“这对我也是个教训啊！”他的委托人痛心疾首地说。“天哪！多可怕的教训！”说着，他把脸深深地埋在手里。</p>
<p>On his way ont of the house， the lawyer stopped and spoketo Poole．</p>
<p>出门的时候，律师停下来跟普尔说了几句话。</p>
<p>'By the way，'he said， 'a letter was handed in today foryour master． Who brought it， and what did he look like？'</p>
<p>“顺便问你一件事，”律师说，“主人今天收到了一封信。是谁送来的，长得什么样？”</p>
<p>'Nobody came except the postman， sir，'said the servant insurprise．</p>
<p>“除了邮差没有别人来过，先生，”仆人惊讶地回答说。</p>
<p>'That worries me，'thought Mr Utterson as he walkedhome．'Clearly the letter arrived by the laboratory door； perhaps it was even written in the study． I must think about thiscarefully．'</p>
<p>“这事真让人担心，”回家的路上，厄特森先生边走边想，“显然，信是从实验室的门递进来的，很可能就是在博士的书房里写的，这事得仔细想想。”</p>
<p>In the street the newsboys were still shouting，'Read allabout it！Terrible murder！'</p>
<p>街上报童高声叫卖着：“卖报卖报！可怕的凶杀案！”</p>
<p>The lawyer's thoughts were sad． One of his clients wasdead，and the life and reputation of another were in danger．Mr Utterson did not</p>
<p>律师的心情十分低落，一个委托人死了，另一个的性命和名誉也发发可危。他一向不向别人求助，但今天情形却不同。</p>
<p>usually ask anyone for advice． Today，however，was different．</p>
<p>晚上，他坐在炉火边，坐在旁边的是事务所主任盖斯特先生。两人共事多年，彼此熟识、了解。盖斯特先生也曾处理过与博士有关的业务，他们也很熟。</p>
<p>That evening he sat by his fireside with his chief clerk， MrGuest，beside him．The lawyer and his clerk had worked together for many years， and knew and understood each other，Also， Mr Guest had been involved in business with DoctorJekyll and knew him well．</p>
<p>外面雾气蒙蒙，阴冷幽暗，屋里却温暖而明亮，桌上还有一瓶上等的威士忌。</p>
<p>Outside it was foggy and dark，but the room was bright andwarm and there was a bottle of good whisky on the table，</p>
<p>“丹佛斯&middot;卡鲁爵士的事真让人难过，”厄特森先生说。</p>
<p>'This is a sad business about Sir Danvers Carew，'said MrUtterson．</p>
<p>“不错，先生，那个凶手肯定是发疯了。”</p>
<p>'Yes indeed，sir．The murderer was a madman，of course．'</p>
<p>“我倒想听听你的看法，”律师又说道，“我这儿有他写的亲笔信。”</p>
<p>'I would like your opinion about that，'replied the lawyer．'I have a letter from the murderer here．'</p>
<p>盖斯特先生专门研究过书法，是个鉴定笔迹的行家。一听这话，他眼睛都亮了。“凶手的信！”他叫道，“这太有意思了！”仔细看了看笔迹，他说：“不像是个疯子，只是这笔迹太少见了！”</p>
<p>Mr Guest was interested in the study of handwriting． Hiseyes brightened at once．'A murderer's letter！' he said．'That will be interesting．'He looked carefully at the writing．'Not a madman， I think，'he said．'But what unusual handwriting！'</p>
<p>正说着，仆人走进来，送上一张便条。</p>
<p>Just then a servant entered with a note．</p>
<p>“是杰基尔博士的条子吗？”盖斯特问，“我想我认识这笔迹。有什么不方便的吗，厄特森先生？”</p>
<p>'Is that note from Doctor Jekyll？' asked Mr Guest．'Ithought I recognized the handwriting．Is it anything private，Mr Utterson？'</p>
<p>“只是请我吃饭的请柬，怎么？你想看看？”</p>
<p>'Only an invitation to dinner．Why？Do you want to seethe letter？'</p>
<p>“就看一下，先生。”那职员把两封信并排放在一起，仔细比较。</p>
<p>'Just for a moment，please，sir．'The clerk put the two letters side by side and studied them carefully．'Thank you，sir，'he said．'Very interesting．'</p>
<p>“谢谢，先生，”他说，“真有意思。”</p>
<p>For a moment Mr Utterson hesitated，wondering and worrying．At last he put his thoughts into words．'Why did youlook at the two letters together？'he asked．</p>
<p>厄特森先生迟疑了一会儿，越想越担心，最后还是忍不住问了出来：“你为什么把两封信放到一起看呢？”</p>
<p>'Well，sir，in many ways the two are surprisingly similar．'</p>
<p>“呃，先生，这两封信的笔体惊人地相似。”</p>
<p>'How strange！…Mr Guest，I must ask you not to speakof this business to anyone．'</p>
<p>“这太离奇了！……盖斯特先生，请你千万不要把这事告诉任何人。”</p>
<p>'Of course not，sir，'said the clerk．'You can depend onme．'Shortly afterwards he said good night to his master andmade his way home．</p>
<p>“当然不会，先生，”职员说，“您放心吧！”没多久，他道了晚安，回家去了。</p>
<p>When he was alone，Mr Utterson locked the two letters inhis cupboard．'Well！'he thought．'So Henry Jekyll wrotethat letter for a murderer！'His face was as calm and expressionless as usual，but his heart was filled with fear for his oldfriend．</p>
<p>又剩下厄特森先生一个人了，他把两封信锁在柜子里。“明白了！”他想，“一定是亨利&middot;杰基尔为凶手写了那封信。”他的脸上像往常一样毫无表情，心里却为老朋友充满了恐惧。</p><a href='5.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
