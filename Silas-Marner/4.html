<p><b>4 戈弗雷有麻烦了 </b></p>
<p>Godfrey was not very surprised to find that Dunstan had not come home after his day's hunting．Perhaps he was staying the night at a public house．But when Dunstan did not return home the next day，Godfrey began to worry about Wild-fire．He did not trust his brother，and wondered if Dunstan had gone away to spend the money on gambling．So he decided to go to look for him．On the road near Raveloe he met his neigh-bour，John Bryce，who had arranged to buy Wildfire from Dun－stan．</p>
<p>戈弗雷对于邓斯坦在狩猎的第二天没有回家来一点儿也不奇怪。他也许又在哪间酒馆呆了一夜。可第三天邓斯坦还没回来，戈弗雷开始有些为他的野火担心了。他信不过他的兄弟，怀疑邓斯坦是不是去把钱花在赌场上了。于是他决定去找邓斯坦，在离瑞福洛不远的路上他遇到了邻居约翰&middot;布莱斯，那个想从邓斯坦那里买走野火的人。</p>
<p>'Well，Godfrey，'said Bryce，'did your brother tell you about the horse？'</p>
<p>“怎么样，戈弗雷，”布莱斯说，“你弟弟告诉你关于马的事儿了吗？”</p>
<p>'What do you mean，John？'replied Godfrey quickly．'No，he hasn't been home yet．What's happened to my horse？'</p>
<p>“什么意思，约翰？”戈弗雷马上问，“他还没回家。我的马怎么了？”</p>
<p>'Ah，so he was yours，was he？Dunstan told me you'd giv-en him Wildfire．I was going to buy him，you know．'</p>
<p>“噢，那是你的马，是吗？邓斯坦告诉我你把野火给他了，你知道我曾经想买那马。”</p>
<p>'What's Dunstan done？Is Wildfire hurt？'asked Godfrey crossly．</p>
<p>“邓斯坦干什么了？野火受伤了？”戈弗雷怒气冲冲地问。</p>
<p>'Worse than that，'answered Bryce．'I'm afraid your horse is dead． We've only just found him．Your brother rode him to the hunt and the horse fell at a gate and broke his back．So you haven't seen Dunstan since yesterday？'</p>
<p>“更糟，”布莱斯回答，“你的马死了，我们刚找到它。你兄弟骑它去狩猎，在跳一个篱笆门的时候马摔断了脊背。从昨天你一直没见你弟弟？”</p>
<p>'No，and he'd better not come home now！'replied Godfrey angrily．'How stupid I was to trust him with my horse！'</p>
<p>“没有，他最好别现在回家来！”戈弗雷气急败坏地说，“我太傻了，竟然把马交给他！”</p>
<p>'But where can Dunstan be？I suppose he wasn't hurt，be－cause we didn't find him near the horse．'</p>
<p>“可邓斯坦在哪儿？我想他没事，因为我们在马旁边没找到他。”</p>
<p>'Him？'said Godfrey bitterly．'Oh，he'll be all right．He'll never be hurt—he only ever hurts other people！We'll hear of him soon enough，don't worry． '</p>
<p>“他？”戈弗雷苦涩地说，“他不会有事儿的。他永远不会受伤——他只会去伤别人！你放心，我们很快会听到他的消息。”</p>
<p>Bryce said goodbye and rode away．Godfrey rode slowly back into Raveloe，thinking about what he would very soon have to do．There was no longer any escape．He must confess the whole truth to his father．For the rest of the day he planned what he would say．He would explain that he had lent Fowler's money to Dunstan，because Dunstan knew his secret．That would be the right moment to tell the Squire about his secret marriage to Molly．'But he'll be very angry！'thought Godfrey．'And when he's angry with people，he just wants to punish them！He won't listen or calm down！But perhaps he'll keep my se-cret—he's so proud of the family name！And if he disinherited me，everyone would talk about it．'</p>
<p>布莱斯告别后骑马走了，戈弗雷边骑马慢慢向村里走，边想下面怎么办。没法再逃了，他必须向父亲承认一切。这一天剩下的时间他都在想该向父亲说些什么。他要向父亲解释因为邓斯坦知道他的秘密，所以他不得不把福勒还来的钱借给了邓斯坦，正好趁此机会告诉父亲自己和莫丽的秘密婚姻。“但他会很生气！”戈弗雷想，“他一定会惩罚惹他生气的人！他不会听我说，也不会平静下来！但也许他会保守我的秘密——他是那么珍视家族的荣誉！如果他取消我的继承权，每个人都会议论这件事。”</p>
<p>When he went to bed that night， Godfrey thought he had decided what to say．But when he woke up in the morning，he could not see any reason to confess to the marriage．Why should he lose the chance of marrying Nancy？ Why should he tell the whole truth now， when perhaps it was not necessary？No，it would be better to go on in the same way as before．Per haps Dunstan would stay away for a while，and then there would be no need to tell his father about Molly．'But today I'll tell the Squire about the money，'he thought．'He'll have to know about that．'</p>
<p>晚上上床的时候，戈弗雷已经决定了怎么说，可早上起床时，他又怎么也找不到承认秘密婚姻的理由了。为什么要失去娶南茜的机会？真有必要现在就承认一切吗？不，像以前那样过更好。也许邓斯坦会在外面呆一段时间，那也就没必要对父亲讲莫丽的事了。“但今天我得对他讲钱的事，”他想，“他必须知道这件事。”</p>
<p>Godfrey was already in the dining-room when his father ar-rived for breakfast．The Squire sat down at the head of the table and ordered the servant to bring him some beer．</p>
<p>父亲来吃早饭时，戈弗雷已经在餐厅了。乡绅在桌子上首坐下，叫用人拿啤酒来。</p>
<p>'Haven't you had breakfast yet，Godfrey？'he asked．</p>
<p>“还没吃过早饭吗？戈弗雷？”他问。</p>
<p>'Yes，I have，sir，'replied Godfrey，'but I was waiting to speak to you．'</p>
<p>“吃过了，先生，”戈弗雷回答，“我等您想说点儿事。”</p>
<p>'Well，you young people have plenty of time，'answered the Squire．'We older ones have to do all the work．'</p>
<p>“你们年轻人总有空闲，”乡绅回答，“可我们老家伙什么活都得干。”</p>
<p>Godfrey looked straight at his father．'Sir，'he said bravely，'I must tell you－something very unfortunate has happened to Wildfire．'</p>
<p>戈弗雷直视着他父亲。“先生，”他鼓足勇气说，“我必须告诉您——野火发生了不幸。”</p>
<p>'What！Has he broken a leg？I thought you could ride bet-ter than that！Well，you can't expect me to pay for a new horse．I'm very short of money at the moment．And I'm angry with Fowler－he still hasn't paid me what he owes me．If he doesn't pay today，he'll go to prison！'the Squire's face was red， and he banged angrily on the table as he spoke．</p>
<p>“什么！它的腿摔断了？我还以为你会骑马呢！别指望我再给你买一匹新马，我这一阵没钱，我正在为福勒生气——他还没有还欠我的钱。今天再不还，我会让他进监狱！”乡绅涨红了脸，生气地拍着桌子说。</p>
<p>'It's worse than breaking a leg，'continued Godfrey miser-ably．'Wildfire's dead．But I don't want you to buy me anoth-er horse．I just feel sorry I can't pay you－you see，sir，the truth is，I'm very sorry，Fowler did pay the money．He gave it to me，and I was stupid enough to let Dunstan have it．And he was going to sell Wildfire and then I was going to repay you the money．'</p>
<p>“比腿断了更糟，”戈弗雷接着沮丧地说，“野火死了。不过我并不想让您给我买新马，我只是为不能还上您的钱而难过——您看，很抱歉，实际上福勒先生已经还了钱，他还给了我，而我太傻了，竟然把钱交给了邓斯坦，我必须再还给您，所以邓斯坦就去卖野火。”</p>
<p>The Squire's face was purple now，and for a moment he could not speak．'You—you let Dunstan have my money？Why did you give it to him？ And why did he want it？Where's Dunstan now？He'll answer my questions， or leave this house！Go and fetch him at once！'</p>
<p>乡绅的脸已经变成了紫色，气得一时说不上话来。“你——你把我的钱给了邓斯坦？为什么给他？他为什么要钱？邓斯坦现在在哪儿？他必须回答我的问题，否则就滚出这幢房子！马上去给我找他！”</p>
<p>'Dunstan hasn't come home，sir．The horse was found dead，and nobody knows where Dunstan is．''Well，why did you let him have my money？ Answer me！'said the Squire，staring angrily at Godfrey．</p>
<p>“邓斯坦还没回家来，先生，马被找到时已经死了，没人知道邓斯坦在哪儿。”</p>
<p>'Well，sir，I don't know，'replied Godfrey，hesitating．He was not good at lying，and was not prepared for his father's questions．</p>
<p>“那你为什么把我的钱给他？回答我！”乡绅愤怒地盯着戈弗雷。</p>
<p>'You don't know？'the Squire repeated scornfully．'Well， I know why． I think you've done something wrong， and you've bribed Dunstan to keep it a secret！That's it，isn't it？'</p>
<p>“我也不知道，先生。”戈弗雷犹豫地回答，他不善于说谎，对父亲的提问也没有准备。</p>
<p>The Squire had made a very clever guess，and Godfrey's heart banged in sudden alarm．He was not ready to confess ev－erything yet．'Well，sir，'he said，trying to speak carelessly，'it was just a little business between Dunstan and me． You wouldn't be interested in it，you know．'</p>
<p>“你不知道？”乡绅藐视地重复道。“我知道了，一定是你做了错事要邓斯坦为你保密！对不对？”</p>
<p>'How old are you now？Twenty－six？'asked the Squire an－grily．'Old enough to look after your money and mine too！I've been much too generous to you boys， but I'm going to be harder on you all from now on． You've got a weak character，Godfrey， like your poor mother． I think you need a wife who knows what she wants， because you can't decide anything by yourself！When you were thinking of marrying Nancy Lammeter，I agreed， didn't I？Have you asked her or not？She hasn't refused to marry you， has she？'</p>
<p>乡绅做了一个聪明的猜想，戈弗雷心里一惊。他还没有准备对父亲承认一切。“噢，先生，”他尽量轻描淡写地说，“这只是我和邓斯坦之间的一点儿小事儿，您不会感兴趣。”</p>
<p>'No，I haven't asked her，'said Godfrey，feeling very hot ad uncomfortable，'but I don't think she'll accept me．'</p>
<p>“你多大了？ 26？”乡绅生气地问，“你已经足够大了，应该能照看你的钱和我的钱了！我以前对你们太宽容了，可从现在开始我会对你们严厉起来。你的性格太软弱了，戈弗雷，就像你那可怜的妈妈。我想你需要有个头脑清楚的老婆来帮帮你，你自己根本不会做任何决定！我不是同意你娶南茜&middot;拉默特吗？有没有向她求婚？她没有拒绝你吧？”</p>
<p>'Don't be stupid， Godfrey！'said the Sqiuire with a scornful laugh．'Any woman would want to marry into our family！Do you want to marry her？'</p>
<p>“我还没有问她，”戈弗雷感到一阵燥热，很不自在，“不过我认为她不会接受。”“别傻了，戈弗雷！”乡绅嘲笑他说，“所有女人都希望嫁到咱们家！你想不想娶她？”</p>
<p>'There's no other woman I want to marry，'said Godfrey，avoiding his father's eyes．</p>
<p>“除了她，我谁都不想娶，”戈弗雷不肯看父亲的眼睛。</p>
<p>'Well，then，let me speak to her father for you，since you aren't brave enough to do it yourself． She's a pretty girl， and intelligent．'</p>
<p>“好吧，既然你没有勇气自己讲，那我替你对她父亲说。那是个漂亮姑娘，也很聪明。”</p>
<p>'No，sir，please don't say anything at the moment，'said Godfrey quickly．'I must ask her myself．'</p>
<p>“不，先生，请先别说，”戈弗雷赶紧说，“我必须自己对她说。”</p>
<p>'Well，ask her then．When you marry her，you'll have to forget about horses and so on．It'll be good for you to do some serious work． You should get married soon．'</p>
<p>“那好，去对她说吧。娶了她以后，你必须忘了那些马什么的。做些正经事对你有好处。你应该赶快结婚。”</p>
<p>'Please don't try to hurry things，sir，'begged Godfrey．</p>
<p>“请您别急，先生。”戈弗雷请求父亲。</p>
<p>'I'll do what I like，'said the Squire firmly．'And if you don't do what I want，I'll disinherit you and you can leave the house．Now，if you know where Dunstan's hiding－I expect you do－tell him he needn't come home． He'll pay for his own food from now on．'</p>
<p>“我想怎样就怎样，”乡绅坚决地说，“如果你不按我想的去做，我将取消你的继承权，你可以离开这里。现在，如果你知道邓斯坦在哪儿——我想你知道——去告诉他，他不用再回来了。从现在起，他得自己付饭钱了。”</p>
<p>'I don't know where he is，sir．Anyway，it's you who should tell him to leave home．'</p>
<p>“我不知道他在哪儿，先生。不管怎样，只有您才可以对他说让他离开这个家。”</p>
<p>'Don't argue with me，Godfrey，'said the Squire，turning back to his breakfast．'Just go and tell the servants to get my horse ready．'</p>
<p>“别跟我争论，戈弗雷，”乡绅的注意力转回他的早餐，“去让用人把我的马备好。”</p>
<p>Godfrey left the room． He was relieved that his father had not discovered the whole truth However， he was a little wor－ried that the Squire would try to arrange his marriage with Nancy．While he was married to Molly，he could not marry Nancy，although it was his dearest wish．But as usual he was waiting and hoping for some unexpected change in his situation， which would save him from any unpleasantness．</p>
<p>戈弗雷离开餐厅，他为父亲没有发现全部实情长出一口气。可是，他有些担心父亲会为他安排和南茜的婚事。虽然娶南茜是他最热切的愿望，但他不可能既娶莫丽，又娶南茜。不过，像往常一样，他等待并希望着会发生一些意想不到的变化，把自己从所有这些麻烦中解脱出来。</p><a href='5.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
