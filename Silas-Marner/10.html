<p><b>10 埃比需要做出选择 </b></p>
<p>That evening Silas was resting in his chair near the fire，after the excitement of the day．Eppie was sitting close to him，holding both his hands，and on the table was Silas's lost gold．He had put the coins in piles，as he used to．</p>
<p>晚上，一天的忙碌过后，西拉斯坐在炉火旁的椅子上休息，埃比拉着他的手坐在他旁边，西拉斯丢的金子放在桌子上。他像从前一样把金币码成一摞一摞的。</p>
<p>'You see，that's all I ever did in the long evenings before you came to me，'he was telling Eppie，'just count my gold．I was only half alive in those days．What a good thing the money was taken away from me！I was killing myself with working all day，and counting money half the night．It wasn't a healthy life．And when you came，with your yellow curls，I thought you were the gold，And then，when I began to love you，I didn't want my gold any more．'He stopped talking for a moment and looked at the money．'The gold doesn't mean anything to me now．But perhaps，if I ever lost you，Eppie，if you ever went away from me，I'd need my gold again．I'd feel lonely then，and I'd think God had forgotten me，and perhaps I'd go back to my bad old habits．</p>
<p>“你看，你来之前，我每天晚上就是这样做的，”他给埃比讲，“只是数我的金子。那时我只有半条生命。金子被偷走对我来说真是件好事！那时我在用整天工作，整晚上数钱的方法自杀。那是不健康的生活。你来的时候，因为你的金黄的头发，我把你当成了金子。后来，当我开始爱你，我就不再想什么金子了。”他停了一会儿，看着金子，“现在金子对我毫无意义了，可是一旦失去你，埃比，或是你离我而去，我会重新需要金子。那时我会感到孤独，我会觉得自己被上帝抛弃了，可能我会回到以前的样子。”</p>
<p>There were tears in Eppie's beautiful eyes，but she did not have time to answer Silas，as just then there was a knock on the door．When she opened it，Mr and Mrs Godfrey Cass came in．</p>
<p>埃比美丽的眼睛里充满了泪水，可她还没来得及回答西拉斯就响起了敲门声。她打开门，戈弗雷&middot;凯斯先生和太太进到屋里来。</p>
<p>Good evening，my dear，'said Nancy，taking Eppie's hand gently．'We're sorry to come so late． '</p>
<p>“晚上好，亲爱的，”南茜轻轻拉着埃比的手，“抱歉我们这么晚来。”</p>
<p>'Well，Marner，'said Godfrey，as he and Nancy sat down，'I'm glad you've got your money back，and I'm very sorry it was one of my family who stole it from you． Whatever I can do for you，I will，to repay what I owe you—and I owe you a lot， Marner．'silas was always uncomfortable with important people like the young Squire．'You don't owe me anything，sir．You've already been very kind to me. And that money on the table is more than most working people can save in their whole life．Eppie and I don't need very much．'</p>
<p>“你好，马南，”戈弗雷一边说，一边和南茜坐下来，“恭喜你找回你的钱。我很惭愧是我们家里的人偷了你的钱。我会尽一切力量去补偿你，马南，我欠你太多了。”西拉斯一向不擅于和像年轻的乡绅这样重要的人物相处。“你不欠我什么，先生，你一直对我很好，桌上的钱已经比好多人一辈子攒的钱都多了，我和埃比并不需要很多东西。”</p>
<p>Godfrey was impatient to explain why they had come．'Yes，you've done well these last sixteen years，Marner，taking care of Eppie here．She looks pretty and healthy，but not very strong. Don't you think she should be a lady，not a working woman？Now Mrs Cass and I，you know；have no children，and we'd like to adopt a daughter to live with us in our beauti-ful home and enjoy all the good things we're used to．In fact，we'd like to have Eppie．I'm sure you'd be glad to see her be－come a lady，and of course we'd make sure you have every thing you need. And Eppie will come to see you very often，I expect．'</p>
<p>戈弗雷急着向西拉斯解释今天的来意。“是的，马南，你这16年来对埃比照顾得非常好，她又漂亮又健康，只是不太强壮。你难道不觉得她应该成为一个淑女而不是个整天干活的人吗？你知道凯斯太太和我没有孩子，我们想收养个女儿，让她和我们生活在一起，住漂亮的房子，享受所有的好东西。实际上我们想收养埃比，我想你会乐意看到埃比成为一位淑女，而且我保证给你你想要的一切，而且我想埃比也会经常回来看你的。”</p>
<p>Godfrey did not find it easy to say what he felt，and as a re－sult his words were not chosen sensitively．Silas was hurt，and afraid．His whole body trembled as he said quietly to Eppie af－ter a moment，'I won't stand in your way，my child．Thank Mr and Mrs Cass．It's very kind of them．'</p>
<p>戈弗雷一时不知用什么词语才能表达自己的感受，结果他用词很不慎重。西拉斯既气愤又害怕，过了一会儿，他全身颤抖着对埃比轻声说：“我不会挡你的路，我的孩子。谢谢凯斯先生和太太，他们的心地很好。”</p>
<p>Eppie stepped forward She was blushing，but held her head high．'Thank you，sir and madam．But I can't leave my father．And I don't want to be a lady， thank you．'she went back to Silas's chair，and put an arm round his neck，brushing the tears from her eyes．</p>
<p>埃比走上前。她的脸很红，可还是努力高昂着头。“谢谢你们，先生、太太，可我不能离开我的爸爸，而且我也不想做什么淑女。谢谢你们。”她说完走回到西拉斯的椅子旁，一只胳膊搂着西拉斯的脖子，拂去眼里的泪水。</p>
<p>Godfrey was extremely annoyed He wanted to do what he thought was his duty．And adopting Eppie would make him feel much less guilty about his past But，Eppie，you must agree，'he cried．'You are my daughter！Marner，Eppie's my own child Her mother was my wife.</p>
<p>戈弗雷被彻底搞烦了，他想履行他心目中自己的责任，而且收养埃比会减轻一些他对过去的负罪感。“可你必须同意，埃比，”他嚷了起来，“你是我的女儿！马南，她是我的孩子，她妈妈是我的妻子。”</p>
<p>Eppie's face went white． Silas，who had been relieved by hearing Eppie's answer to Godfrey，now felt angry．'Then，sir，'he answered bitterly，'why didn't you confess this sixteen years ago，before I began to love her？Why do you come to take her away now，when it's like taking the heart out of my body？God gave her to me because you turned your back on her！ And He considers her mine！'</p>
<p>埃比的脸变得惨白，刚刚为埃比的回答感到欣慰的西拉斯此时愤怒了。“那么先生，”他痛苦地说，“那你为什么不在16年前，我还没有开始爱她的时候承认？为什么你现在来把她带走，像挖走我的心一样？上帝把她给了我，因为你不要她！上帝认为她是我的！”</p>
<p>I know I was wrong，and I'm sorry，'said Godfrey．'But be sensible， Marner！She'll be very near you and will often come to see you．She'll feel just the same towards you．</p>
<p>“我知道我错了，我很抱歉，”戈弗雷说，“可你理智点儿，马南，她会离你很近而且会常来看你，她对你的感情也会和以前一样。”</p>
<p>'Just the same？'said Silas more bitterly than ever．'How can she feel the same？We're used to spending all our time to-gether！We need each other！</p>
<p>“一样？”西拉斯更痛苦了，“怎么会和以前一样？我们所有的时间都在一起，习惯了！我们不能分开！”</p>
<p>Godfrey thought the weaver was being very selfish．'I think，Marner，'he said firmly，'that you should consider what's best for Eppie．You shouldn't stand in her way，when she could have a better life．I'm sorry，but I think it's my duty to take care of my own daughter．'</p>
<p>戈弗雷认为织布匠太自私了。“我认为，马南，”他坚决地说，“你得想想怎么样对埃比最好。你不应该妨碍她去过更好的生活。我很抱歉，可我想照顾我自己的女儿是我的责任。”</p>
<p>Silas was silent for a moment．He was worried that perhaps Godfrey was right，and that it was selfish of him to keep Eppie．At last he made himself bring out the difficult words．'All right．I'll say no more．Speak to the child．I won't pre－vent her from going．'</p>
<p>西拉斯沉默了一会儿，他也担心或许戈弗雷是对的，自己留下埃比是不是太自私了。终于他艰难地说：“好吧，我不再说了，你对孩子说吧。她要走，我不会拦着。”</p>
<p>Godfrey and Nancy were relieved to hear this，and thought that Eppie would now agree．'Eppie，my dear，'said Godfrey，'althought I haven't been a good father to you so far，I want to do my best for you now．And my wife will be the best of mothers to you．'</p>
<p>听到这些，戈弗雷和南茜舒了一口气，他们想这回埃比该同意了。“亲爱的埃比，”戈弗雷说，“我虽然以前没有做个好父亲，可我今后会尽所有努力对你好，我的妻子也会成为你最好的母亲。”</p>
<p>'I've always wanted a daughter，my dear，'added Nancy in her gentle voice．</p>
<p>“我一直想要一个女儿，亲爱的。”南茜轻声说。</p>
<p>But Eppie did not come forward this time．She stood by Silas's side，holding his hand in hers，and spoke almost coldly．'Thank you，sir and madam， for your kind offer．But I wouldn't be happy if I left father．He'd have nobody if I weren't here．Nobody shall ever come between him and me！'</p>
<p>这回埃比没有走上前。她站在西拉斯的旁边，拉着他的手，冷冷地说：“谢谢你们的好意，先生太太，可我离开爸爸就不会再感到幸福。我不在这儿，他就谁也没有了。没有人能把我们分开。”</p>
<p>'But you must make sure，Eppie，'said Silas worriedly，' that you won't be sorry，if you decide to stay with poor people．You could have a much better life at the Red House．'</p>
<p>“但你必须肯定，埃比，”西拉斯担心地说，“你留下和穷人在一起不会后悔。到红屋你会过得好得多。”</p>
<p>'I'll never be sorry，father，'said Eppie firmly．'I don't want to be rich，if I can't live with the people I know and love．'</p>
<p>“我永远也不后悔，爸爸，”埃比坚决地说，“如果不能和我了解的、我爱的人在一起，我不会渴望富有。”</p>
<p>Nancy thought she could help to persuade Eppie．'What you say is natural，my dear child，'she said kindly．'But there's a duty you owe to your lawful father．If he opens his home to you，you shouldn't turn your back on him．'</p>
<p>南茜想自己应当帮着劝劝埃比。“你说的很自然，我的孩子。”她慈爱地说，“可你对你的生父也有义务。他把家门为你打开，你不该不理睬他。”</p>
<p>'But I can't think of any home except this one！'cried Eppie，tears running down her face．'l've only ever known one father！And I've promised to marry a working man，who'll live with us，and help me take care of father！</p>
<p>“可我除这儿之外没有别的家。”埃比泪流满面，“我只知道一个爸爸，而且我已经决定要嫁给一个普通人，他会和我们生活在一起，和我一起照料爸爸。”</p>
<p>Godfrey looked at Nancy Let's go，'he said to her bitterly，in a low voice．</p>
<p>戈弗雷看着南茜。“我们走吧！”他低声说，声音很苦涩。</p>
<p>'We won't talk of this any more，'said Nancy，getting up．We just want the best for you，Eppie my dear，and you too，Marner．Good night．'</p>
<p>“我们不会再提这件事，”南茜站起身，“我们只希望你们好，亲爱的埃比，还有你，马南。晚安！”</p>
<p>Nancy and Godfrey left the cottage and walked home in the moonlight．When they reached home，Godfrey dropped into a chair．Nancy stood near him，waiting for him to speak．After a few moments he looked up at her，and took her hand．</p>
<p>南茜和戈弗雷离开小屋，踏着月色回到家。一进家门，戈弗雷就跌坐在椅子里，南茜站在他旁边，等着他开口，过了一会儿，他抬起头，拉着她的手。</p>
<p>'That's ended！'he said sadly．</p>
<p>“全完了！”他伤心地说。</p>
<p>She kissed him and then said，'Yes，I'm afraid we can't hope to adopt her，if she doesn't want to come to us．</p>
<p>她吻了吻他，然后说：“是的，我想她不想和我们走，我们就不可能收养她了。”</p>
<p>'No，'said Godfrey，'it's too late now．I made mistakes in the past，and I can't put them right．I wanted to be childless once，Nancy，and now I'll always be childless．'</p>
<p>“现在太晚了，”戈弗雷说，“我过去做了错事，现在已经不可能弥补了，我曾希望没有孩子，南茜，但现在，我将永远没有孩子了。”</p>
<p>He thought for a moment，and then spoke in a softer voice．'But I got yon，Nancy，and yet I've been wanting something different all the time Perhaps from now on I'll be able to ac－cept our life better，and we'll be happier．'</p>
<p>想了一会儿，戈弗雷用更轻柔的声音说：“可我得到了你，南茜，但我总想要更新鲜的东西。也许从现在起，我更能够接受我们的生活，我们会更快活。”</p>
<p>The following spring，there was a wedding in Raveloe．The sun shone warmly as Eppie walked through the village towards the church，with Silas，Aaron and Dolly．Eppie was wearing the beautiful white wedding dress she had always dreamed of，which Nancy Cass had bought for her．She was walking arm in arm with her father，Silas．</p>
<p>第二年春天，一个婚礼在瑞福洛举行。与西拉斯、阿荣和多莉一起，埃比在暖融融的阳光里穿过村子走向教堂。埃比穿着南茜&middot;凯斯为她买来的、她一直梦想能穿的美丽洁白的婚纱，她的爸爸西拉斯挽着她的胳膊。</p>
<p>'I promise nothing will change when I'm married，father，'she whispered to him as they entered the church．'You know I'll never leave you．</p>
<p>“我保证结婚后什么都不会变，爸爸，”进教堂时她对西拉斯耳语，“我永远不会离开你。”</p>
<p>There was quite a crowd of villagers outside the church to see the wedding．Just then Miss Priscilla Lammeter and her fa－ther drove into the village．</p>
<p>教堂外面很多人来参加婚礼，这时拉默特先生和普丽西拉正乘车走进村子。</p>
<p>'Look，father！'cried Priscilla．'How lucky！We're in time to see the weaver's daughter getting married！Doesn't she look lovely？I'm sorry Nancy couldn't find a pretty little or－phan girl like that to take care of．</p>
<p>“看，父亲！”普丽西拉叫着，“多幸运！我们正赶上织布匠女儿的婚礼！她真可爱！可惜南茜没有收养到一个这样可爱的小孤女。”</p>
<p>Yes，my dear，'agreed Mr Lammeter．'Now that we're all getting older，it would be good to have a young one in the fam－ily．Unfortunately，it's too late now．</p>
<p>“是的，亲爱的。”拉默特应和道，“我们都老了，家里是应该有个小家伙。可惜现在太晚了。”</p>
<p>They went into the Red House，where Nancy was waiting for them．They had come to spend the day with her，because Godfrey was away on business and she would perhaps be lonely without him．The Casses were not going to Eppie's wedding．</p>
<p>到红屋时，南茜正在等他们。他们来就是为了陪她。因为戈弗雷外出办事了，南茜也许会很寂寞。凯斯家的人没有参加埃比的婚礼。</p>
<p>When the little wedding group came out of the church，the villagers and Silas's family all went to the Rainbow．There a wonderful wedding lunch was waiting for them，which had been ordered and paid for by Godfrey Cass．</p>
<p>仪式进行完，西拉斯一家人和村民们都从教堂出来走进了小酒馆。戈弗雷&middot;凯斯在这里为他们订下了一桌丰盛的酒席。</p>
<p>'It's very generous of the young Squire to pay for all this，'said the landlord as he refilled the beer glasses． 'Well，what would you expect？'replied old Mr Macey sharply．'Remember，it was his own brother who stole the weaver's gold！And Mr Godfrey has always helped Master Marner，with furniture and clothes and so on，since young Ep-pie came to the cottage．Well，it's only right to help a man like Master Marner．And I'd like you all to remember—I was the first to tell you I thought Master Marner was harmless—and I was right！Now let's drink to the health of the happy young couple！'And the villagers lifted their glasses and cried，' To Eppie and Aaron！'</p>
<p>“乡绅真大方，花钱办这酒席。”酒馆主人边添啤酒边说。“你以为呢？”麦西先生尖刻地说，“记住，是他弟弟偷了人家织布匠的金子！而且自从埃比到了小屋，戈弗雷先生经常帮助马南师傅，给他衣服、家具什么的。帮助一个像马南师傅这样的人是对的。我想你们都应当记得是我最先说马南师傅不是坏人的——我是对的！现在让我们为新人的健康干杯！”村民们都举起杯喊：“为埃比和阿荣干杯！”</p>
<p>When the meal was over and the guests had begun to return to their homes，Silas，Eppie and her new husband walked slow-ly back to their cottage by the quarry．It had been enlarged by Godfrey Cass's workmen，and was looking lovely in the late af－ternoon sunshine．</p>
<p>当酒席结束，客人们已开始回家的时候，西拉斯与埃比和她的新婚丈夫一起慢慢走回他们在采石场边上的小屋，小屋已经被戈弗雷&middot;凯斯的工人们扩大了，在下午的阳光下显得格外可爱。</p>
<p>'Oh father，'said Eppie．'What a pretty home ours is！I think nobody could be happier than we are！ '</p>
<p>“哦，爸爸，”埃比说，“我们的家多么可爱呀！我想我们是世界上最幸福的人！”</p></body></html>
