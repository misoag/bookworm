<p><b>6 新年舞会 </b></p>
<p>On December 3lst it was snowing and very cold．All day there were ladies and gentlemen arriving at the Red House．</p>
<p>虽然12月31日的天气很冷，而且下着雪，可一整天都有人从四面八方到红屋来。</p>
<p>Godfrey Cass was waiting at the door for the only guest he cared about，Nancy Lammeter．Finally she arrived，sitting be hind her father on his horse，looking more beautiful than ever．Her lovely face blushed as she saw Godfrey come forward to lift her down from the horse．'Why is he waiting for me？'she thought．'I thought I made it clear to him that I'll never mar－ry him．People say he leads a bad life，and I can't marry a man like that．'</p>
<p>戈弗雷在门口等待着他唯一关心的客人——南茜&middot;拉默特。终于她来了，坐在马背上，在他爸爸背后，比平时更美丽动人。当戈弗雷过来扶她下马的时候，南茜漂亮的脸一下子红了。“他等我干什么？”她想，“我想我已经清楚地告诉过他我不会嫁给他。人们说他生活糜烂，我可不会嫁给这样的人。”</p>
<p>But the Squire appeared just then， to welcome his guests，and in the excitement nobody noticed Nancy's pink face as Godfrey's strong arms lifted her down．She hurried into the house with the other ladies to change her clothes．</p>
<p>这时乡绅出来迎接他的客人，人们都很高兴，也就没人注意到戈弗雷用强壮的手臂扶她下来时她的红脸。南茜和其他女子一块儿跑进屋里去换衣服。</p>
<p>The house was full of servants running here and there．Mrs Kimble，who always helped the Squire arrange these parties，was giving orders in a loud voice．Cooks were preparing food in the kitchens，and there was already a wonderful smell of baking in the air．</p>
<p>屋里用人们在跑这儿跑那儿地服务，金布尔太太在大声下达着命令，她经常帮乡绅安排这些聚会。厨子们在厨房忙着准备饭菜，空气里飘着烤面包的香味。</p>
<p>Upstairs，the ladies were excitedly putting on their best dresses，while talking to each other all the time．Nancy met her aunt，Mrs Osgood，who introduced her to some visitors of hers．The Misses Gunn were two young ladies who were not beauti－ful，but dressed very fashionably．</p>
<p>楼上，女士们一边不停地聊天一边换上最漂亮的衣服。南茜遇到了姨妈奥斯古德太太，姨妈把自己的客人介绍给她，其中有两位年轻女士，甘氏姐妹，她们不太漂亮但穿得很时髦。</p>
<p>Just then Nancy's older sister Priscilla arrived．She was a large，cheerful girl，with a round face and a nose pink with cold．As they were changing their clothes，Priscilla said to Mrs Osgood，'Look at our dresses，aunt！Of course Nancy looks beautiful in hers，but this colour makes me look yellow！ Nan－cy says we must wear the same dresses，because we're sisters，although I'm five years older！I'm ugly，I know I am．But I don't mind！'she turned to Mrs Osgood's two visitors．'In my opinion the pretty girls are useful－I'm sure you agree－to catch the men．I don't think men are worth worrying about．Any woman with a good father and a good home had better stay single．That's what I'm going to do，anyway．We ugly girls don't need husbands！'</p>
<p>这时南茜的姐姐普丽西拉来了，她是个快活的圆脸大个子女孩，鼻子冻得红红的。换衣服时，普丽西拉对奥斯古德太太说：“看我们的衣服，姨妈，南茜穿起来当然漂亮，可我穿起来太老了！南茜说我们是姐妹，要穿一样的衣服，尽管我比她大5岁！我知道我丑，可是我不在乎。”她又转向姨妈的两个朋友，“我想你们也同意女孩子漂亮就容易抓住男人的心，我可不在乎男人。有个好爸爸、好家庭的女人最好单身。我就打算这样。我们丑姑娘不需要丈夫。”</p>
<p>Mrs Osgood stood up and said quickly，'My visitors and I should go downstairs now．Priscilla and Nancy，we'll see you later．'And the three ladies hurried out．</p>
<p>奥斯古德太太赶紧站起来说：“我们要下楼了。普丽西拉，南茜，过会儿见。”3个女人急匆匆出去了。</p>
<p>'Oh really，Priscilla！'cried Nancy，when they were alone．'You never think before you speak！ I'm sure the Misses Gunn thought you were very impolite！You almost told them they were ugly！'</p>
<p>“真是的，普丽西拉！”只剩她们姐妹俩时南茜生气地说，“你从来不在讲话前先想想！我敢肯定甘氏姐妹认为你很无礼！你差不多是在告诉她们她们是丑姑娘！”</p>
<p>'Did I？'asked Priscilla in surprise．'Well，that's the way I am．I always tell the truth．But I'm the ugly one—just look at me！'</p>
<p>“是吗？”普丽西拉很奇怪，“嗨，我这人就这佯，我总是讲实话。可是看看我，我也丑呀！”</p>
<p>'Priscilla，you know I asked you to choose the dresses，'replied Nancy worriedly．'I don't mind what colour I wear．'</p>
<p>“普丽西拉，你知道我是让你来挑的衣服，”南茜为难地说，“我不在乎穿什么颜色。”</p>
<p>'You look lovely in this colour，dear child！You know you always have whatever you want in the end，although you never give orders or shout about it．I'm looking forward to seeing you married．It'll be fun watching you make your husband do exactly what you want．'</p>
<p>“傻孩子，你穿这种颜色好看！虽然你从不会大嚷大叫或者发号施令，可你最后总能得到你想要的。我盼着看到你结婚，看着你让你的丈夫按你的意思去做，多开心呀！”</p>
<p>'Don't say that，'answered Nancy， blushing． 'You know I'm never going to get married．'</p>
<p>“别说这些，”南茜的脸红了，“你知道我永远不会结婚。”</p>
<p>Priscilla laughed．'I'm the one who'll stay single．And if you don't like Godfrey Cass，well，there are plenty of other young men．Come，let's go downstairs now．'</p>
<p>普丽西拉笑了，“我才是那个要单身的女人，如果你不喜欢戈弗雷&middot;凯斯，还有很多别的小伙子。走吧，咱们下楼去！”</p>
<p>Although Priscilla was right in saying she was not good-looking，she was very popular among her neighbours because she was so cheerful and sensible．And Nancy was not only con－sidered to be the most beautiful girl in and around Raveloe，but also one of the most intelligent．</p>
<p>虽然普丽西拉确实像她说的那样，不太好看，可她在邻居中人缘很好，因为她开朗而且懂事。而南茜不仅是瑞福洛一带最漂亮的女孩，而且也是最聪明的女孩。</p>
<p>Seats at the dining－table had been kept for the Lammeter sisters．Priscilla was taken to sit between her father and the Squire．Nancy felt herself blushing again as Godfrey Cass came to lead her to a seat between himself and the vicar，Mr Crack－enthorp She knew that if she married Godfrey，she would one day be the most important woman in Raveloe，the Squire's wife But she repeated firmly to herself that she could not mar－ry a man of bad character．</p>
<p>餐桌边拉默特姐妹的座位已经留好了，普丽西拉的座位在爸爸和乡绅之间。南茜觉得自己又脸红了，她被戈弗雷领到了他自己与教区牧师克拉肯索普先生之间的座位上。她知道如果嫁给戈弗雷，自己就会成为瑞福洛最显贵的女人，乡绅的妻子。可她反复对自己强调不能嫁给一个品行不端的人。</p>
<p>As she sat down，the vicar，who was always polite to ladies，said with a smile，'Ah，Miss Nancy，you're looking lovely this evening．Isn't she，Go dfrey？'</p>
<p>她坐下时，一贯对女士彬彬有礼的牧师微笑着说：“啊，南茜小姐，您今晚真漂亮，是不是，戈弗雷？”</p>
<p>Godfrey made no reply，and avoided looking at Nancy． There was too much he wanted to say to her．But the Squire， who al－ways enjoyed his parties and was feeling extremely cheerful，was rather impatient with his son．He thought he had better speak，if Godfrey was too shy to do it himself．</p>
<p>戈弗雷没有回答，也尽量不去看南茜。他有太多的话想对她说。可这时对晚会心满意足的乡绅对自己的儿子有些不耐烦了。他认为既然儿子太害羞张不开嘴，那么自己最好亲自说了。</p>
<p>'That's right，'the Squire said loudly．'When I look at Miss Nancy here，I think she's more beautiful than any girl I've ev-er seen．'</p>
<p>“是的，”乡绅大声说，“我觉得南茜比我见过的任何姑娘都要漂亮。”</p>
<p>While they were eating and drinking，people around the table were listening with interest to the Squire's words．' Per－haps Godfrey will marry Nancy after all！'the vicar's wife whispered to Mrs Osgood．Mr Lammeter's back was very straight as he looked across the table at his daughter．He was a serious，careful gentleman，who considered the Lammeters a better family than the Casses．He had already decided that Godfrey must change his way of life before Nancy could possi-bly marry him．</p>
<p>桌上所有的人都在一边用餐一边饶有兴趣地听着乡绅的话。“大概戈弗雷还是会娶南茜！”牧师的太太小声对奥斯古德太太说。拉默特先生在桌子对面笔直地坐着，看着女儿。这是一位严肃谨慎的绅士，他认为拉默特家比凯斯家还要好。他早就决定在戈弗雷痛改前非之前不会把南茜嫁给戈弗雷。</p>
<p>Just then Dr Kimble called across the table，'Miss Nancy，will you save a dance for me？'</p>
<p>这时金布尔先生隔着桌子对南茜发出了邀请：“南茜小姐，可不可以和我跳支舞？”</p>
<p>'Come，come，Kimble，'said the Squire，'let the young ones enjoy themselves．My son Godfrey'll be angry if you take Miss Nancy away．I expect he's asked her for the first dance already．Haven't you，Godfrey？'</p>
<p>“行了，金布尔，”乡绅插了进来，“让年轻人玩他们的吧！你把南茜小姐带走，我儿子戈弗雷会生气的。我想他已经邀请南茜小姐和他跳第一支舞了，是不是戈弗雷？”</p>
<p>Godfrey was feeling very uncomfortable by now．Turning to Nancy，he said as lightly as possible，'I haven't asked her yet，but I hope she'll agree，if nobody's asked her…'</p>
<p>戈弗雷感到很不自在，他转向南茜，尽量小声地说：“我还没有，可我希望她同意，如果还没人请她的话……”</p>
<p>'No，I haven't accapted anyone else，'replied Nancy quietly with a blush．</p>
<p>“不，我还没接受任何人的邀请。”南茜轻声回答，脸又一红。</p>
<p>'So will you please have the first dance with me？'asked Godfrey，beginning to feel better．She had not refused him！</p>
<p>“那你能否和我跳第一支舞？”戈弗雷的感觉好了一点儿。她没有拒绝自己！</p>
<p>'I will，'answered Nancy coldly．She was still sure she would not marry him，but she wanted to remain polite．</p>
<p>“可以。”南茜冷淡地回答。虽然仍然肯定自己不会嫁给他，可南茜想尽量保持礼貌。</p>
<p>'Ah well，you're a lucky man，Godfrey，'said Dr Kimble with a laugh．'I think I can hear the music starting now！'</p>
<p>“好呀，你是个幸运的小子，戈弗雷。”金布尔先生笑着说，“我想已经开始奏乐了！”</p>
<p>The guests got up from the table in pairs and small groups，to move into the large hall，where the dancing was about to start．The small village band was already playing，as the Squire led the vicar's wife to the end of the hall to start the dance．They were followed by Godfrey and Nancy，and the other ladies and gentlemen．</p>
<p>客人们一对对或三五成群地起身走到大厅里，舞会要开始了。在乡村小乐队的伴奏下，乡绅把牧师的太太领到大厅的尽头带头跳起来，接下来是戈弗雷和南茜，然后是其他客人们。</p>
<p>As the dance went on，Godfrey felt happier and happier．Holding Nancy in his arms，he forgot all his problems．Sudden－ly the Squire's heavy foot stood on part of Nancy's dress，and some of the material was pulled away at the waist．Nancy asked Godfrey to take her to a quieter place，where she could repair the damage．He took her to a small room near the hall，hoping they would have a few private moments together． But Nancy sat down on the chair furthest away from him， and said coldly，'Thank you，sir．You needn't stay． I'm very sorry about taking you away from the dance．'</p>
<p>跳着舞，戈弗雷感到越来越幸福。搂着南茜，他忘掉了一切烦恼。忽然乡绅的脚重重地踩住了南茜的长裙，把衣服腰间的部分扯坏了。南茜让戈弗雷带她到一个清静的地方去整理衣服。戈弗雷把她带进了大厅旁边的一间小屋，希望他们能够有一段单独相处的时间。可南茜坐在了离他最远的椅子上，冷冷地说：“谢谢您，先生，您不必呆在这儿，很抱歉让您从舞会上出来。”</p>
<p>'It's not very kind of you，'said Godfrey，moving close to her，'to be sorry you've danced with me．'</p>
<p>“这样可不太好，”戈弗雷走近她一点儿，说，“你为什么不愿意和我跳舞呢？”</p>
<p>'I didn't mean that'replied Nancy，blushing prettily．'Gentlemen have so many things to enjoy．I'm sure one dance can't matter very much．'</p>
<p>“我不是这个意思！”南茜的脸红得很可爱，“绅士们有那么多事可做，我肯定跳支舞没什么重要。”</p>
<p>'You know that isn't true．You know one dance with you means more to me than anything else in the world．'</p>
<p>“你知道不是这样的，你知道和你跳一支舞对我比任何事都重要。”</p>
<p>Nancy was a little surprised．Godfrey had not said anything like this to her for a long time．She replied firmly，'I'm afraid I can't believe you，Mr Godrey．'</p>
<p>南茜有些吃惊，戈弗雷很久没有对她说这样的话了。她坚决地回答：“戈弗雷先生，我恐怕不能相信你。”</p>
<p>'Nancy，if I changed my life，would you think better of me？Would you—like me，then？'Godfrey knew these were danger－ous words，but the sudden chance of speaking to her alone made him say more than he had planned．</p>
<p>“南茜，如果我改变我的生活，你会觉得我好一点儿吗？你会——喜欢我吗？”戈弗雷知道这些话很危险，可这突然来的单独谈话的机会使他讲了比计划里多得多的话。</p>
<p>'I'd be glad to see a good change in anybody，sir．'</p>
<p>“我对任何人的好的变化都感到很高兴，先生。”</p>
<p>'You're very hard，Nancy，'said Godfrey bitterly．'You could help me to be better．I'm very miserable—but you don't feel anything．'</p>
<p>“你太苛刻了，南茜。”戈弗雷有些苦涩，“你可以帮我变好。我很痛苦——可你什么也感觉不到。”</p>
<p>'I think people who behave badly don't feel anything，'said Nancy sharply，forgetting to be cool and distant．</p>
<p>“我认为品行不端的人才会什么也感觉不到。”南茜尖锐地说，忘了冷静和距离。</p>
<p>Godfrey was delighted．He wanted to make her argue with him，to show him that she cared about him．But just then Priscilla hurried in，saying，'Dear child，let me look at your dress！I saw the Squire step on it during the dance．'</p>
<p>戈弗雷很高兴，他想让南茜和他争论，这说明南茜仍然在乎他。可这时普丽西拉闯了进来，说：“好孩子，让我看看你的衣服，我看见乡绅在跳舞的时候踩到你了。”</p>
<p>'I suppose I'd better go now，'Godfrey said disappointedly to Priscilla．</p>
<p>“我想我得走了。”戈弗雷失望地对普丽西拉说。</p>
<p>'It doesn't matter at all to me whether you go or stay，'said Priscilla impatiently，looking closely at the waist of Nancy's dress．</p>
<p>“你走不走我都无所谓。”普丽西拉不耐烦地说，她在仔细地看南茜衣服的腰部。</p>
<p>'Do you want me to go？'Godfrey asked Nancy．</p>
<p>“你想让我走吗？”戈弗雷问南茜。</p>
<p>'Do whatever you like，'replied Nancy， trying to sound cold again．</p>
<p>“随你便。”南茜尽可能恢复以前的冷淡。</p>
<p>'Well，I want to stay，'answered Godfrey，and sat down．Tonight he wanted to enjoy being with Nancy for as long as possible，without thinking about what would happen tomorrow．</p>
<p>“那么我想留下来。”戈弗雷说着坐下来。他今天晚上要尽可能多地呆在南茜身边，不管明天会怎么样。</p><a href='7.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
