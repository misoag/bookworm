<p><b>7 西拉斯找到了他的“金子” </b></p>
<p>But while Godfrey Cass was managing to forget his prob-lems by the lovely Nancy's side，his wife was walking with slow，uncertain steps along the snow－coverea road to Ray－eloe．She was carrying her sleeping child in her arms．</p>
<p>就在戈弗雷&middot;凯斯坐在可爱的南茜身边试图忘记一切烦恼的时候，他的妻子正在大雪覆盖的道路上艰难地向瑞福洛的方向跋涉着。她的孩子睡在她的臂弯里。</p>
<p>For some time now she had planned to come to Raveloe on New Year's Eve．She knew that her husband would be at the centre of a happy，smiling group of friends，and she had chosen this moment to appear in front of all his family and guests at the Red House dance．'I don't care if Godfrey is ashamed of mes！'she thought bitterly．'I want people to know we're mar－ried！'sometimes she hated her husband， because he was still handsome，and had money，while she was no longer pretty，and very poor．She blamed him for her miserable life，but in her heart she knew she should blame her drinking．It had become a habit wiht her to spend most of the money Godfrey gave her on gin．She had a bottle in her pocket now，which she had lifted to her lips several times during her journey．</p>
<p>她已经计划好要在新年之夜到瑞福洛去，她知道她的丈夫一定正在被幸福欢笑的朋友们环绕着，她就是要选择这个时候出现在他的家人和朋友们面前，出现在红屋的舞会上。“我不在乎戈弗雷会以我为耻，”她苦涩地想，“我要让大家知道我们结婚了！”有时她恨她的丈夫，因为他仍然英俊而且富有，可她已经不再漂亮了，而且贫困。她为自己的不幸怨他，但在心底里她知道应该怨自己酗酒。她已经习惯于把戈弗雷给她的钱用来买酒，现在她兜里就有一瓶酒，而且一路上她已经喝了几次。</p>
<p>It was already seven o'clock in the evening，and there was a freezing wind．Molly did not know she was very near Raveloe．Her legs were tired and the gin was beginning to make her feel sleepy．She thought she would rest for a while，and，still hold－ing her child，she lay down on the snow．She did not notice that the ground was cold．</p>
<p>已经是晚上7点了，风冷得刺骨。莫丽不知道她已经离瑞福洛很近了。她的腿开始发沉，酒精也开始使她昏昏欲睡。她想应该歇一会儿，于是就抱着孩子，躺到了雪地上。她没有注意地上是那么冷。</p>
<p>In a few moments the child woke up，crying，'Mummy！'But the mother did not seem to hear．Suddenly，as the child fell gently out of its mother's arms on to the soft snow，it noticed a bright，dancing light on the white ground．Interested，the child stood up to see where the brightness came from，and followed the light to an open door，the door of Silas Marner's cottage．The little one toddled right in through the door and sat down by the bright fire．After a few minutes the child felt pleasantly warm， and fell asleep．</p>
<p>一会儿孩子醒了，开始哭着喊妈妈。可妈妈好像没有听见。孩子从妈妈的臂中滑落到松软的雪地上时，忽然看到白白的雪地上跳动着一点小小的亮光。出于好奇，孩子站起来想看看光是从哪儿来的。向着亮光，孩子走进了一扇开着的门，这是西拉斯&middot;马南的小草屋。小家伙蹒跚着直进门里走到明亮的炉火前坐下。没过几分钟，孩子暖和过来，甜甜地睡着了。</p>
<p>But where was Silas while this was happening？In the evenings he sometimes used to open his door and look out．He had some idea that his money would come back，or that some-one would come with information about the thief Tonight was New Year's Eve，and the villagers had told him to stay awake until midnight，because it would bring him good luck if he saw the beginning of the new year．So tonight he was more restless than usual．He opened his door several times during the evening，and stared out，but he saw and heard nothing in the silent，freezing night．The last time，as he was standing at the door，he had one of his fits，and stood there completely uncon-scions，holding the door open．</p>
<p>这时西拉斯在哪儿呢？他晚上有时会打开门看看外面，总觉得有一天他的金子会回来，或者什么人会给他带来关于贼的消息。今晚是新年夜，村里人告诉他今天午夜前不要睡觉，因为看着新的一年到来会给人带来好运。所以今晚他比平时更坐立不安。他几次打开门向外面看，可是在这个静静的寒冷的冬夜，他什么也看不见，什么也听不见。最后一次站到门口的时候，他又犯病了，站在那儿完全失去了知觉。门开着。</p>
<p>When he became conscious again，he closed the door and turned back to the fire．But when his shortsighted eyes looked at the floor in front of the fire，he seemed to see gold there！Gold—his own gold—taken and then brought back to him in the same strange way！His heart beat excitedly，and for a few moments he was unable to move．At last he reached out his hand to touch the gold，but instead of hard，metal coins his fin－gers felt soft，warm curls．</p>
<p>恢复知觉以后，他关上门回到炉火前，但当他的近视眼看到炉前的地板时，他好像发现了金子！金子——他的金子——奇怪地离他而去又以同样的方式奇怪地回到了他的身边！他的心剧烈地跳动起来，好一会儿他都不能移动。终于他伸手去摸那金子，可是没有摸到硬硬的金币，却摸到了软软的暖暖的鬈发。</p>
<p>With great surprise Silas fell on his knees to look at this wonderful thing．It was a sleeping child．Was he dreaming？Could it be his little sister，who had died when he was a child himself？If it wasn't a dream，how had the child entered the cottage？But thinking of his sister made him remember the past，and his life at the Light Street chapel．He wondered if this child was some kind of message from his past，sent perhaps by the God he had once trusted．</p>
<p>西拉斯惊奇地跪到地上去看这神奇的东西。这是一个熟睡着的孩子。是不是在做梦？这是不是自己小时候死去的小妹妹？如果不是梦，这孩子怎么到屋里来的？想到妹妹使他想到了自己的过去，想到在日光街小教堂的事。他怀疑这孩子会不会是那他曾经信任过的上帝派来向他传递关于他过去生活的什么信息的。</p>
<p>Just then the child woke up，and began to cry．Silas held it in his arms，and spoke softly to quieten it．He remembered that he had made some porridge earlier，and gave a little to the child to eat．She stopped crying，and lifted her blue eyes with a smile to Silas's face as she ate．But then she pulled at her wet shoes，trying to take them off，and Silas suddenly realized she had come to the cottage through the snow．So he picked her up and went to the door．As he opened it and went out into the dark，the child cried'Mummy！'and reached forward，almost jump-ing out of his arms．A few steps away，Silas found a young woman's body，half-covered with snow．</p>
<p>这时候孩子醒了，开始哭。西拉斯把孩子抱在怀里，轻声地哄着。他想起来自己做的麦片粥，就拿出来喂孩子。孩子不再哭了，一边吃一边抬起蓝眼睛看着西拉斯的脸甜甜地笑。当她使劲想把那双湿湿的鞋子拽掉时，西拉斯想到她一定是从雪里走来的，于是就抱着孩子走向屋门。他打开门走进黑暗中时，孩子喊着妈妈向前挣去，险些从西拉斯的胳膊里跳到地上。几步之外，西拉斯看见一个半埋在雪里的年轻女人。</p>
<p>At the Red House，everybody was enjoying the party．Some people were still eating，while others were dancing or playing cards．Godfrey was looking forward to his next dance with Nancy．He was watching her dreamily across the room，when suddenly he saw something that made his lips go white and his whole body tremble． It was his own child，carried in Silas Marner's arms．The weaver had come straight into the hall，where the dancing was going on．</p>
<p>在红屋里，人们在尽情享受着晚会的快乐，有的人还在吃着东西，有的人在玩纸牌或者跳舞。戈弗雷在等着和南茜的下一个舞。正当他如醉如痴地远远地看着南茜的时候，眼前的景象使他一下嘴唇煞白，浑身发抖。他看到了他的孩子，在西拉斯的怀里。织布匠径直闯进了正在开舞会的大厅。</p>
<p>Several people turned to look at the strange figure in the doorway．The Squire could not understand why Sllas had come in uninvited． He stood up and asked angrily，'Marner， what are you doing here？'</p>
<p>有人转过去看门口这个奇怪的人，乡绅不明白西拉斯为什么会没有得到邀请就来到晚会上。他站起来生气地问：“马南，你来干什么？”</p>
<p>'I've come for the doctor，'replied Silas hurriedly．' There's a woman－dead，I think－near my cottage．'</p>
<p>“我来找大夫，”西拉斯着急地回答，“有个女人在我小屋旁边，我想已经死了。”</p>
<p>Godfrey had one great fear at that moment，that the woman was not dead．If she were his wife，and she were dead，he would be free to marry Nancy！</p>
<p>戈弗雷这时真怕那个女人没有死，如果那是他的妻子，而且死了，他就可以娶南茜了！</p>
<p>While the Squire was calling for Dr Kimble，the ladies came closer to look at the pretty child．</p>
<p>乡绅叫金布尔大夫的时候，女人们都围过来看这个漂亮的小女孩。</p>
<p>'Whose child is it？'one of them asked．</p>
<p>“这是谁的孩子？”有人问。</p>
<p>'I don't know，'replied Godfrey wildly．'Some poor woman's－she's been found in the snow，I think．'</p>
<p>“我不知道，”戈弗雷暴躁地回答，“一个穷女人的——我想是在雪地上发现的那个。”</p>
<p>'You'd better leave the poor child here with us then，Master Marner，'offered Mrs Kimble kindly．</p>
<p>“你最好把这个可怜的孩子留在我们这儿，马南师傅。”金布尔太太好心地说。</p>
<p>'No－I can't let it go，'said Silas unexpectedly．'It's come to me—I don't know where from—I want to keep it！''Well！'said Mrs Kimble，surprised．'A single man like you！Take care of a child！Well！'But the little one was holding on to Silas，and smiling up at him confidently．</p>
<p>“不——我不让她离开我，”西拉斯的回答出人意料，“她是来找我的，我要留下她，虽然我不知道她从哪儿来。”“你？”金布尔太太很诧异，“你这么个单身男人！照顾一个孩子！行吗？”可这时候小家伙正靠在西拉斯身上，在信任地对着西拉斯笑。</p>
<p>Dr Kimble hurried into the hall．'Where is this poor woman？Near the old quarry？Someone had better fetch Dolly Winthrop．I'll need her to help me．</p>
<p>金布尔大夫跑进大厅：“那可怜的女人在哪儿？在采石场附近吗？最好去叫一下多莉&middot;温思罗普，我需要她的帮助。”</p>
<p>'I'll go！'cried Godfrey．He wanted to get away，before any one noticed his white face and shaking hands， and he needed time to think． He ran out into the night．</p>
<p>“我去！”戈弗雷喊。趁人们还没发现他苍白的嘴唇和颤抖的手，他想赶快离开，他需要时间仔细想想。他一溜烟跑进黑夜中。</p>
<p>When he and Dolly arrived at the quarry，the doctor had moved the woman into Silas's cottage，and Godfrey had to wait outside．He walked up and down in the snow，for what seemed like hours． He knew he should tell the truth about the woman and the child，but he could not make himself do what he knew was right．'Is she dead？'the voice inside his head asked．'If she is，I can marry Nancy．And then I'll be good，and have no more secrets．And I'll make sure the child is taken care of，of course．</p>
<p>当他和多莉到采石场的时候，大夫已经把女人移到了西拉斯的小屋。戈弗雷得在外面等着。他在外面走来走去，觉得大概过了几个小时。他知道他应当讲出关于女人和孩子的实情，可他怎么也不能让自己去做应当做的事。“她死了吗？”他的脑子里有个声音在问。“如果她死了，我就能娶南茜了，我一定要变好，不再做见不得人的事，而且我一定会好好照料孩子的，一定会。”</p>
<p>When Dr Kimble came out of the cottage，Godfrey tried to speak calmly．'I thought I'd wait to see…'he began．</p>
<p>金布尔大夫出来的时候，戈弗雷尽可能平静地说：“我想我应当等在这儿看看……”</p>
<p>'Oh，there was no need for you to come．Why didn't you send one of the men to fetch Dolly？The woman's dead， I'm afraid．She's very thin，and looks very poor．But she's got a wedding ring on．She'll be buried tomorrow．</p>
<p>“噢，你不必亲自来，怎么不派别人去接多莉？我想那女人已经死了。她很瘦弱，看来很穷，却戴着个结婚戒指。明天给她下葬。”</p>
<p>'I'll just have a look at her，'said Godfrey quickly．' I think I saw a woman on the road yesterday with a child．Perhaps it was her．'And he ran into the cottage．</p>
<p>“我得看她一眼，”戈弗雷很快地说，“我昨天在路上看见了一个抱孩子的女人，也许就是她。”说着他跑进了小屋。</p>
<p>There on the bed was his unloved wife．He only looked at her for a moment， but for the rest of his life he never forgot her sad，tired face．</p>
<p>床上躺着他已经不再爱的妻子。他只看了她一会儿，但终生都没有忘记她那张忧伤疲惫的脸。</p>
<p>The weaver had come back with the doctor，and was sitting by the fire，with the child on his knees．The little one was awake，but her wide open blue eyes looked up into Godfrey's face without recognizing him at all．The father was glad of this，but also a little sad，especially when he saw the small hand pull lovingly at the weaver's grey hair．</p>
<p>织布匠是和大夫一起回来的，他坐在火炉旁，抱着孩子。小家伙醒着，她睁大了蓝眼睛盯着戈弗雷的脸看，可是根本没认出他来。这使父亲很高兴，可也有些难受，特别是当他看到那双小手在充满爱意地拉着织布匠的灰色头发的时候。</p>
<p>'So，who's going to take care of the child？'Godfrey asked，pretending not to show much interest．</p>
<p>“那谁来照料这孩子呢？”戈弗雷努力掩饰自己的关心。</p>
<p>'I am，'replied Silas firmly．'The mother's dead，and I sup-pose the child hasn't got a father． She's alone in the world，and so am I．My money's gone，I don't know where，and she's come，I don't know where from．I don't understand it at all，but I'm going to keep her．'</p>
<p>“我，”西拉斯坚决地说，“她妈妈死了，我想孩子也没有爸爸，她像我一样在这个世上孤苦零叮我的钱不知到哪儿去了，而她不知从哪儿来了。这一切我都不明白，可我一定要抚养她。”</p>
<p>'Poor little thing！'said Godfrey．'Let me give you some-thing for her clothes．'He put his hand in his pocket and gave Silas some coins．</p>
<p>“可怜的小东西！给你些钱去给她买衣服。”戈弗雷从兜里拿出一些钱交给西拉斯。</p>
<p>As he walked back to the Red House，he felt very relieved．Nobody would recognize his dead wife，and soon his secret would be buried with her．Now he could talk of love to Nancy．He could promise to be a good husband to her．Only Dunstan knew about the secret marriage，and perhaps Dunstan would never come home．'What a good thing I didn't confess every－thing to the Squire！'he thought．'Now I can make Nancy and myself happy And the child？Well，it won't matter to her whether I'm her father or not．</p>
<p>回红屋的路上，戈弗雷异常轻松，没有人会认识他死去的妻子，他的秘密很快就要和她一起被埋掉了。现在他可以和南茜谈情说爱了，他可以向她保证做一个好丈夫。只有邓斯坦知道那段秘密婚姻，可他可能永远不会再回来了。“我没有向父亲坦白一切是多么对呀！”他想，“现在我可以让自己和南茜幸福了。可孩子呢？嗨，我是不是她父亲对她也并不重要。”</p>
<p>That week the dead woman was buried in Raveloe，and the child stayed at the weaver's cottage．The villagers were very surprised that Silas had decided to keep her，but they liked him for wanting to help an orphan．The women，especially，were very ready to give him useful advice on taking care of children．</p>
<p>那个星期这个死去的女人被埋在了瑞福洛，小女孩留在了织布匠的小屋。大家很惊讶西拉斯决定收留这孩子，可又都很高兴他能关心孤儿。女人们更是时刻准备着向西拉斯提供抚养孩子的经验。</p>
<p>Dolly Winthrop came every day to help Silas．'It's no trou－ble，'she said．'I get up early，so I've got plenty of time．And I can bring you some of Aaron's old baby clothes，so you won't need to spend a lot of money on the child．I can wash her，and give her food，and—'</p>
<p>多莉&middot;温思罗普每天来帮助西拉斯。“没问题，”她说，“我起得早，所以有足够的时间。我可以把阿荣的旧衣服拿来，你也就不必为孩子花很多钱。我可以给她洗澡，可以给她喂饭，可以……”</p>
<p>'Ye—es，'said silas，hesitating．He was looking a little jeal－ously at the baby in Dolly's arms．'That's very kind of you．But—but I want to do everything for her myself！I want her to be fond of me！She's my child！'</p>
<p>“好——吧，”西拉斯犹豫地说。他有点儿忌妒地看着多莉怀里的孩子。“你真好，可——我想自己来为她做一切！我想让她喜欢我！她是我的孩子。”</p>
<p>'Don't worry，'said Dolly gently，giving him the child．'Look，she loves you the best．See，she's smiling at you！</p>
<p>“别担心，”多莉把孩子交还给西拉斯，温柔地说，“看，她最爱的人还是你。看见了吗，她在对你笑呢！”</p>
<p>And so Silas learnt how to take care of the little girl．He called her Eppie，which had been his little sister's name．His life was quite different now．When he was working and living only for his gold，he had not been interested in the world outside his cottage，or the people he sometimes met．But now that he had another reason for living，he had to look outward．He spent hours in the fields with Eppie，happily rediscovering the plants he used to know so well．Together they visited his neighbours，who were always delighted to see him and his adopted child．His days and evenings were full，taking care of a trusting，lov-ing child．</p>
<p>于是西拉斯学会了照顾这个小女孩。他管她叫埃比，这是他的小妹妹的名字。他的生活全变了。当他为金子而工作而生活的时候，他对屋外的世界，对那些偶然见到的人们毫无兴趣。现在生活的目的变了，他不得不开始看看外面的世界。他花几个小时陪埃比在地里玩，又愉快地重新发现了那些他曾经熟悉过的植物。他们一起去串门，去看那些喜欢见到他和他的养女的邻居们。照看这个信赖他、喜欢他的孩子使他的日日夜夜变得很充实。</p>
<p>Godfrey Cass watched the little girl growing up with great interest During Eppie's childhood he often gave money to Silas to spend on her，but was careful that nobody should suspect him of being her father．His life was also changing．There was a new firmness about him which everyone noticed He was looking forward to marrying Nancy very soon．'Nancy and I will have children！'he thought happily．'But I won't forget that other child！'</p>
<p>戈弗雷&middot;凯斯关注地看着小女孩一点儿一点儿长大。埃比小的时候他经常送钱给西拉斯去给埃比买东西，可他又很小心，怕别人怀疑自己是孩子的父亲。他的生活也变了。每个人都能发现他变得稳重了。他盼着能快些娶南茜。“南茜和我会再有孩子。”他高兴地想。“不过我不会忘了那另一个孩子。”</p><a href='8.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
