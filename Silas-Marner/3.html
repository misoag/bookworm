<p><b>3 西拉斯的金子哪儿去了？ </b></p>
<p>When Dunstan Cass left the cottage，Silas Marner was only a hundred metres away．He was walking home from the village，where he had gone to buy what he needed for his next day's work．His legs were tired，but he felt almost happy．He was looking forward to supper-time，when he would bring out his gold．Tonight he had an extra reason to hurry home．He was going to eat hot meat，which was unusual for him．And it would cost him nothing，because someone had giv-en him a piece of meat as a present．He had left it cooking over the fire．The door key was needed to hold it safely in place，but Silas was not at all worried about leaving his gold in the cot-tage with the door unlocked．He could not imagine that a thief would find his way through the mist，rain and darkness to the little cottage by the quarry．</p>
<p>邓斯坦&middot;凯斯离开的时候，西拉斯仅仅在100米之外，他从村里买了第二天干活用的东西，正往家里走。西拉斯的腿很累，但他心里很高兴。他期待着晚饭时间的到来，那时他又可以拿出金子来了。今晚他匆匆回家还有个特别的理由，他今天要吃一块热热的烤肉，平时他很少吃肉。不过他并没有花钱，因为这块肉是别人送给他的礼物。他出来时已经把它烤在了火上，肉是用大门钥匙串起来的，西拉斯一点儿也不担心不锁门而把金币留在小屋里，他不信会有贼能在这样的大雾、大雨里摸黑找到他在采石场边上的小草屋。</p>
<p>When he reached his cottage and opened the door，he did not notice that anything was different．He threw off his wet coat，and pushed the meat closer to the fire．As soon as he was warm again，he began to think about his gold．It seemed a long time to wait until after supper，when he usually brought out the coins to look at．So he decided to bring out his gold immediate－ly，while the meat was still cooking．</p>
<p>他回到家，打开门，没有发现任何异常。他脱下湿衣服，把肉向火上推了推，一暖和过来，他马上开始想他的金子。他不能像平时那样等到吃完晚饭再把金子拿出来，那要等太久了，他决定趁肉还在烤着，马上拿出金子来。</p>
<p>But when he took up the floorboards near the loom，and saw the empty hole，he did not understand at once．His heart beat violently as his trembling hands felt all round the hole．There was nothing there！He put his hands to his head and tried to think．Had he put his gold in a different place，and forgotten about it？He searched every corner of his small cottage，until he could not pretend to himself any more．He had to accept the truth－his gold had been stolen！</p>
<p>当他扒开织机旁的地板，看到洞里空空的什么也没有时，并没有马上明白过来。他的心剧烈地跳着，用颤抖的手把洞摸了个遍，什么也没有！他用手抱着头，想好好想一想。是不是自己把金子放在了别处又忘了？他找遍了草屋的每一个角落，但终于一无所获，他不能再欺骗自己了。他不得不接受这一事实——他的金子被偷走了！</p>
<p>He gave a wild，desperate scream，and stood still for a mo－ment．Then he turned towards his loom，and almost fell into the seat where he always worked．He touched the loom to make sure it，too，had not been stolen．Now he was beginning to think more clearly．'A thief has been here！If I can find him，he'll have to give back my gold！But I was only away for a short time，and there's no sign of anyone entering the cottage．'He wondered whether it was really a thief who had taken his money，or whether it was the same cruel God who had already destroyed his happiness once．But Silas preferred to suspect a thief，who would perhaps return the money．He began to think it must be Jem Rodney，a local poacher，who had known about Silas's money，and who sometimes visited the cottage．Silas felt stronger now that he thought he knew the thief．'I must go and tell the Squire，and the police！'he said to himself．'They'll make Jem give me back the money！'so he hurried out in the rain without a coat，and ran towards the Rainbow．</p>
<p>他发出一声绝望的惨叫，呆呆地站了一会儿，猛地转向织机，险些跌倒在每天干活的座位上。西拉斯摸着织布机以确定他的织布机还没有被偷走。这时他的思想清楚了一些。“一定是有贼来过！如果我能找出这个人，他就得把金子还给我！可我只离开了一会儿，也看不出有人进过屋呀！”他不明白是真的有贼偷走了他的钱，还是那个曾经毁坏过他幸福生活的残忍的上帝又在惩治他。不过西拉斯宁愿怀疑是贼干的，因为贼还可能把钱还回来。他开始猜想贼一定是本地的偷猎者杰姆&middot;罗德尼，因为他知道西拉斯有钱，而且以前来过小屋。西拉斯以为自己知道贼是谁了，就感到自己强大了点儿。“我必须去告诉乡绅和警察！”他对自己说，“他们会让杰姆还我钱。”于是他来不及披外衣就冲进雨里，向彩虹酒馆跑去。</p>
<p>He thought he would find the most important people in Rav－eloe at the public house，but in fact most of them were at Mrs Osgood's birthday dance．There were，however，five villagers at the Rainbow，enjoying an interesting conversation about ghosts，while drinking their beer．</p>
<p>西拉斯本以为一定能在酒馆见到瑞福洛最重要的人们，可实际上大部分人都去参加奥斯古德太太的生日舞会了。然而还是有5个村民在酒馆中一边喝着啤酒，一边闲谈着有关鬼怪的事。</p>
<p>'I tell you，people have seen ghosts，'the butcher said．'And I'll tell you where，too．Behind the church！'</p>
<p>“告诉你们，有人真的见过鬼，”屠户说，“而且我告诉你们在哪儿，就在教堂后面！”</p>
<p>'That's right，'agreed old Mr Macey．'You young ones aren't old enough to remember，but people have seen ghosts near the church since I was a boy．Oh yes，it's true．'</p>
<p>“没错，”麦西老先生附和着，“你们太小了，不记得，从我小时候起人们就在教堂附近看见过鬼。没错，是真的。”</p>
<p>The farrier laughed scornfully．'Ghosts！People imagine they see things on a dark night！You can't make me believe in ghosts！It's a question of fact！There are no ghosts！'</p>
<p>马掌匠嘲讽地大笑起来。“鬼！人们总幻想着在黑夜里看到什么！你别想让我相信！这是个事实问题！世界上根本没有鬼！”</p>
<p>'Now，now，'began the lanalord，who always tried to keep the peace，'in some ways you're all wrong，and in some ways you're all right，that's my opinion．There are ghosts，and there aren't，well，that's what people say．And…'</p>
<p>“行了，行了，”酒馆主人发话了，他总想维持和平，“我觉得你们都不对，又都对，人们总说有鬼没鬼，但……”</p>
<p>Just then Silas's white face appeared suddenly in the door－way．He had run all the way from his cottage，so he could not speak for a moment．He stared silently at the men with his strange staring eyes，looking exactly like a ghost．For a few minutes nobody said anything，while Silas tried to control his breathing．Then the landlord spoke．</p>
<p>这时西拉斯苍白的脸突然出现在过道里。他从草屋一路跑来，所以一时说不出话来，只是不声不响地用那双奇怪的、直瞪着的眼睛盯着人们，确实有点儿像一个鬼。半晌没有人说话，而西拉斯则在努力地使自己呼吸平稳下来。然后酒馆主人打破了沉默。</p>
<p>'What do you want，Master Marner？Come，tell us．'</p>
<p>“怎么了，马南师傅？来，告诉我们。”</p>
<p>'Robbed！'cried Silas，suddenly able to speak．'I've been robbed！I want the police，and the Squire！'He waved his arms wildly as he spoke．</p>
<p>“贼！”西拉斯喊道，他忽然能说话了。“我被贼偷了！我要找警察，还有乡绅！”他边说边疯狂地挥着手。</p>
<p>'Hold him，Jem，'said the landlord to the poacher，who was sitting near the door．'I think he's gone mad．'</p>
<p>“按住他，杰姆，”酒馆主人对坐在门边的偷猎者说，“我想他疯了&middot;”！</p>
<p>But Jem moved quickly away．'Not me！'he replied．'I don't want anything to do with a ghost！'</p>
<p>可杰姆马上躲到了一边。“别让我按他，”他答道，“我可不想和魔鬼打交道！”</p>
<p>'Jem Rodney！'cried Silas，turning and staring at the man he suspected．</p>
<p>“杰姆&middot;罗德尼！”西拉斯转脸盯着这个他怀疑的人喊道。</p>
<p>'Yes，Master Marner？'answered Jem，trembling a little．</p>
<p>“怎么啦，马南师傅？”杰姆有点儿发抖。</p>
<p>'If it was you who stole my money，'said Silas，going close to Jem，'just give it back to me，and I won't tell the police．Please—just give it back．'</p>
<p>“如果是你偷了我的钱，”西拉斯走近了说，“还给我，我不会去报告警察。请你还给我！”</p>
<p>'Stole your money！'cried Jem angrily．'I'll throw this glass at you if you accuse me of stealing your money！'</p>
<p>“偷你的钱！”杰姆生气地喊道，“如果你再诬陷我偷你的钱，我就用杯子砸你！”</p>
<p>'Come now，Master Matner，'said the landlord firmly，tak－ing Silas by the arm．'You must explain what you mean if you want us to believe you．And sit down by the fire to dry your clothes．You're very wet．'</p>
<p>“来，马南师傅，”酒馆主人拉住西拉斯坚决地说，“如果想让我们相信你，你必须向我们讲清楚。来，坐下烤烤你的衣服，你都湿透了。”</p>
<p>'That's right，'said the farrier．'No more staring like a madman．That's what I thought you were at first—not a ghost，of course．'</p>
<p>“对，”马掌匠说，“别再像疯子似地瞪着眼了，我一开始就认为你不是个魔鬼而是个疯子。”</p>
<p>The weaver sat down，in the centre of the little group of men，and told his story．It felt strange but pleasant to him，to talk to his neighbours and tell them his problems．The men re－alized at once that Silas was telling the truth．They had sus－pected him of working for the devil，but they knew now that the devil was no longer taking care of him．</p>
<p>西拉斯坐下来，在一小群人中间讲起自己的故事。和邻居讲话并告诉他们自己的问题，这种感觉让西拉斯感到很奇特，可也很愉快。人们马上意识到西拉斯讲的是实话，他们确实怀疑过西拉斯为魔鬼工作，可他们相信现在魔鬼不再照料他了。</p>
<p>'Well，Master Marner，'said the landlord in the end，'you mustn't accuse poor Jem．He sometimes steals a chicken，we all know that，but he's been sitting here drinking with us all evening．So he's not the thief．'</p>
<p>“好了，马南师傅，”酒馆主人最后说，“你千万别再为难可怜的杰姆了，我们都知道他有时会偷只鸡什么的，可今晚他一直在这儿和我们一起喝酒，所以他不会是贼。”</p>
<p>'That's right，'said old Mr Macey．'You can't accuse someone who hasn't done anything wrong，Master Marner．'</p>
<p>“没错，”麦西老先生说，“你不能难为没有做错事的人，马南师傅。”</p>
<p>These words brought the past back to Silas，and he remem－bered standing in front of his accusers in the Light Street chapel．He went up to Jem．</p>
<p>这些话使西拉斯想起了过去的事，想起了许多年前在日光街教堂里他站在指责他的人面前。他走到杰姆面前。</p>
<p>'I was wrong，'he said miserably．'I'm sorry，Jem．I had no reason to accuse you．But—where can my gold be？'</p>
<p>“我错了，”他痛心地说，“对不起，杰姆，我不该难为你，可是——我的金子哪儿去了？”</p>
<p>'Perhaps some stranger came to your cottage while you were out，'said the farrier．'But we must report the robbery to the police and the Squire immediately．'</p>
<p>“可能有陌生人在你不在的时候闯进了你的小屋，”马掌匠说，“但不管怎样我们必须马上向警察和乡绅报案。”</p>
<p>Next morning，when the whole village heard about the stolen gold，they all discussed it excitedly．A few people still did not trust Silas or believe his story．Most people，however，were suspicious of the pedlar who had visited Raveloe the month be－fore．Perhaps he had returned to hide near the quarry，and steal the money when Silas left his cottage．Several villagers thought they remembered his evil-looking face，and felt sure he was not honest．</p>
<p>第二天，全村人都听说了丢金子的事，大家都在兴奋地议论，一小部分人仍然不相信西拉斯和他的故事，而大多数人都怀疑上个月来过瑞福洛的小贩，没准儿他溜回来藏在了采石场附近，然后趁西拉斯出门的时候偷了钱。有几个村民更是想起来他们早就从小贩那张罪恶的脸上看出他不是好人。</p>
<p>Silas himself remembered that the pedlar had come to his cottage door recently．He hoped the pedlar was indeed the thief，because the police could catch him and make him give back the money．His home seemed very empty to him without his gold，and he desperately wanted to get it back．</p>
<p>西拉斯自己也想起小贩不久前到过自己的小屋。他希望小贩真的是贼，那样警察就能抓住他让他还钱了。没有了金子，小屋显得空空荡荡，西拉斯不顾一切地想找回金子。</p><a href='4.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
