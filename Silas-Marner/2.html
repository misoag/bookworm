<p><b>2 戈弗雷&middot;凯斯和邓斯坦&middot;凯斯 </b></p>
<p>The most important person in Raveloe was Squire Cass， a gentleman farmer，who lived with his three sons in the handsome Red House opposite the church，and owned a num-her of farms outside the village．His wife had died many years before．</p>
<p>瑞福洛村最重要的人物是乡绅凯斯。他的妻子许多年前就已经死了，只有他和3个儿子一起住在教堂对面的漂亮的“红屋”里，在村子外面有大片属于他的土地。</p>
<p>One dark November evening，fifteen years after Silas Marner had first arrived in Raveloe，some of the villagers were drinking beer in the public house，the Rainbow．Old Mr Macey，the church clerk，was remembering the Squire's wife．</p>
<p>11月的一个傍晚，在西拉斯&middot;马南来到瑞福洛村15年以后，几个村民在名叫“彩虹”的小酒馆里喝酒，教堂的执事麦西老先生讲起了凯斯的妻子。</p>
<p>'She was a wonderful lady，'he said，shaking his grey head sadly．'Everything was always so pretty and clean at the Red House when she was alive！When she died，all those years ago，the poor Squire，well，he didn't know what to do．And he's still lonely，believe me！That's why we often see him in here in the evenings．And another thing，if poor Mrs Cass were alive today，I'm sure she'd be very disappointed with her sons．The Squire should make those boys do some work，but in－stead he lets them stay at home and gives them money to spend on horses，or gambling，or women！ '</p>
<p>“那是个好女人，”麦西伤感地摇着长满灰发的头，“她在的时候，红屋从来都是那么干净、漂亮！许多年前，她去世的时候，可怜的乡绅，唉，他不知道该怎么办。现在，他仍然很孤独，真的！所以我们才会经常见他晚上到这儿来喝酒。如果凯斯太太还活着，她一定会为她的儿子们感到失望。乡绅应该让他的儿子们去干点儿活，而不应该让他们呆在家里，还给他们钱去玩马、赌博、找女人！”</p>
<p>'Come，come，Mr Macey，'said the landlord．'They're rich young gentlemen，after all．You can't expect them to work on the farms like us country people．But you're right about Dun－stan Cass．He's a bad one，he is．Always borrowing money，and never paying it back．Always gambling，always in trouble！He'll come to a bad end，he will！'</p>
<p>“行了，麦西先生，”酒馆主人说，“不管怎么说，人家是有钱的年轻绅士，你哪能让他们像我们这些乡下人一样下地干活呢？不过邓斯坦&middot;凯斯倒确实像你说的，他确实不怎么样，总在借钱，却从来不还，总是赌博，而且总是惹麻烦！他一定不会有好下场！”</p>
<p>'But the other two are different，'said the butcher，a red-faced，smiling man．'Bob Cass is still only a boy．And Mr God-frey，the eldest，well，I don't believe he'll be like his brother Dunstan．Just look at him！He's got an open，honest face．And he's going to inherit the Squire's money and all the land．And what's more，he's going to marry Miss Nancy Lammeter．When she moves into the Red House as Mrs Godfrey Cass，she'll make life more comfortable for all the Casses．She'll save the Squire money too—the Lammeters have the best of every－thing in their house，but they're very careful with their money．'</p>
<p>“另两个可不一样，”笑眯眯的红脸屠户说，“鲍勃&middot;凯斯还是个孩子，老大戈弗雷先生可不像他兄弟邓斯坦，看看他那张脸是多么的诚实、大方。他会继承乡绅的财产和所有的土地，而且他还会娶南茜&middot;拉默特小姐。等她以戈弗雷&middot;凯斯太太的身份入主红屋后，她会把凯斯全家的生活照料好。而且她会为乡绅节省很多钱——拉默特家有各种最好的东西，可他们用钱很小心。”</p>
<p>The farrier，a small man with a sharp face，always enjoyed disagreeing with the butcher．'Mr Godfrey marry Miss Nancy！'he laughed．'That's what you think！Haven't you noticed how Miss Nancy has changed towards Godfrey since last year？You remember，he was away from home，for days and days．Nobody knows what he was doing，but Godfrey hasn't been the same since then．Miss Nancy isn't stupid—she won't marry a man she can't trust！'</p>
<p>长着尖脸的小个子马掌匠最爱和屠户过不去。“戈弗雷先生娶南茜小姐！”他大笑着说，“这是你这么想！你没发现从去年开始南茜小姐对戈弗雷的态度已经变了吗？你知道，他经常离开家外出，一去好多天。没人知道他在干什么，可从那时起他就变了。南茜小姐可不傻——她不会嫁给一个她把握不住的人。”</p>
<p>The landlord always tried to prevent his customers from ar-guing．'What you all say is very true．But let's hope that Mr Godfrey doesn't lose his chance of marrying Miss Nancy．'</p>
<p>酒馆主人总是试图平息客人们的争论。“你们说的都对，但愿戈弗雷先生不要失去娶南茜小姐的机会。”</p>
<p>Meanwhile，at the Red House，Godfrey Cass was waiting for his brother in the sitting－room，with a very worried expression on his handsome face．Soon the door opened，and a heavy-look-ing young man entered．It was Dunstan．He had clearly been drinking．</p>
<p>在大家在酒馆谈论的同时，在红屋里，戈弗雷&middot;凯斯正在客厅中等他的弟弟邓斯坦，他英俊的脸上一脸焦急。一会儿，门开了，一个粗壮的年轻人走进来。这就是邓斯坦，他显然刚喝过许多酒。</p>
<p>'How I hate him！'thought Godfrey．</p>
<p>“我太恨他了！”戈弗雷心里想。</p>
<p>'Well，sir，'said Dunstan unpleasantly，'you sent for me，and as you're the oldest，and you'll be the Squire one day，I have to obey you．So what do you want？'</p>
<p>“啊，先生，”邓斯坦不高兴地说，“你派人叫我，因为你是老大，因为有一天你会成为乡绅，所以我不能不听命于你。你想干什么？”</p>
<p>'Just listen，will you？'replied Godfrey angrily，'if you aren't too drunk to understand！You must pay me back the money I lent you last month．You know I got it from Fowler，of Church Farm．He owed the money to the Squire，and asked me to give it to him．Now the Squire is angry with Fowler for not paying，and I've got to give the money back！'</p>
<p>“如果还没醉得听不懂话你就好好听着！”戈弗雷生气地说，“你必须把我上个月借给你的钱还给我。你知道我是从教堂农场的福勒那里拿的钱，他这些钱是欠咱们父亲的，他让我把这钱还给父亲。现在父亲以为福勒还没有还钱，所以很生气，我必须把钱还回去！”</p>
<p>Dunstan came close to Godfrey and smiled in an evil way．'Well，my dear kind brother，why don't you find the money yourself？That would be much less trouble for me！'</p>
<p>邓斯坦走近戈弗雷阴险地笑了。“好吧，我亲爱的好心的哥哥，你为什么不自己去找钱？那就不会太麻烦我了！”</p>
<p>Godfrey controlled himself with difficulty．'Don't smile at me like that，or I'll hit you！'</p>
<p>戈弗雷努力控制住自己。“别这么对我笑，否则我揍你！”</p>
<p>'Oh no，you won't，answered Dunstan．'Because if you do，I'll tell the Squire your secret．I'll tell him that his handsome eldest son fell in love with that poor girl Molly in the town，and married her in a hurry．The Squire'll be angry because you married her in secret，and he'll disinherit you．Then I'll get the house and land when the old man dies！But don't worry，I'm a good brother to you．I won't tell him，and you'll find the money to pay back，I know you will．'</p>
<p>“不，你不会，”邓斯坦回答，“因为如果你揍了我，我就会向父亲告发你的秘密。我会告诉他，他的漂亮的长子爱上了城里的一个穷丫头莫丽，而且匆匆忙忙娶了她。父亲会因为你偷偷娶了她而生气的，并且会取消你的继承权。那么我将在老头儿死后得到这房子和土地！不过别担心，我是你的好兄弟，我不会告诉他，而且你会自己找到钱还回去，我知道你会的。”</p>
<p>'Where can I get the money from？'cried Godfrey．'I tell you，I haven't got any！'</p>
<p>“我到哪儿去弄钱？”戈弗雷喊道，“告诉你，我没钱！”</p>
<p>'You could borrow It，'said Dunstan carelessly．'Or wait-I've had a better idea．You could sell your horse．'</p>
<p>“你可以去借，”邓斯坦漫不经心地说，“或者，等等——我有个好点儿的主意，你可以把马卖了。”</p>
<p>'Sell Wildfire！You know how muchl love that horse！'</p>
<p>“卖野火？你知道我是多么喜欢这匹马！”</p>
<p>'Well，you could ride him to the hunt tomorrow．I know two or three men who'd be interested in buying him，and they'll be at the hunt，I'm sure．It'd be easy．'</p>
<p>“好了，你可以明天骑着它去狩猎会，我知道有几个人想买它，明天他们肯定也在狩猎会，这很容易。”</p>
<p>'No，I haven't got time to go hunting tomorrow．I-I'm going to Mrs Osgood's birthday dance．'</p>
<p>“不行，明天我没时间去狩猎会。我——我得去参加奥斯古德太太的生日舞会。”</p>
<p>'Aha！'said Dunstan，laughing．'And perhaps you'll see sweet Miss Nancy there—and you'll dance with her－and you'll talk of love…'</p>
<p>“噢！”邓斯坦大笑起来，“没准儿你能在那儿见到可爱的南茜小姐——你会和她跳舞——你会和她谈情说爱……”</p>
<p>'Be quiet！'shouted Godfrey，his face turning red．'Don't speak of Miss Nancy like that，or I'll kill you！'</p>
<p>“住嘴！”戈弗雷喊道，他的脸红了。“别这么说南茜小姐，否则我杀了你！”</p>
<p>'Don't get so angry，brother，'answered Dunstan calmly．'You've got a very good chance with her．In fact，I advise you to be nice to her．You and I know that Molly's started drink ing．Well，if she drinks too much one day and dies，then you could marry Nancy．She wouldn't mind being a second wife，if she didn't know there was a first．And luckily you've got a kind brother who'll keep your secret well．'</p>
<p>“别这么生气，哥哥，”邓斯坦冷冷地说，“这是你和她的好机会，真的，我劝你对她好一点儿。咱们都知道莫丽开始喝酒了，有一天她喝多了酒死了，你就能娶南茜了，她不会介意做第二个太太的，如果她根本不知道有个第一个的话。有我这么个好弟弟为你保守秘密，你是多么幸运呀。”</p>
<p>Godfrey's face was white now，and he was trembling．'Look，Dunstan，I've nearly had enough of this．You can push a man too far，you know．Perhaps I'll go to the Squire now and confess everything to him．He'll discover the truth one day，because Molly says she'll come and tell him．She wants every－one to know we re married．When the Squire knows the truth，you won't get any more money from me！'</p>
<p>戈弗雷脸色惨白，有些颤抖。“邓斯坦，我受够了，别欺人太甚，或许我会马上去找父亲承认这一切。他早晚会发现真相，因为莫丽说会来告诉他。她希望每个人都知道我们结婚了。等父亲知道了，你就别想再从我这儿弄一分钱！”</p>
<p>Dunstan replied lightly，'Do what you like，brother．'</p>
<p>邓斯坦轻松地回答：“随你便，哥哥。”</p>
<p>Godfrey hesitated．He knew he had fallen into Dunstan's trap，when he made the mistake of marrying Molly．It was Dunstan who had Introduced his brother to Molly，hoping that Godfrey would fall in love and marry her．Dunstan was clearly delighted that his evil plan had succeeded．Godfrey was now in a difficult situation．He no longer loved his young wife，and could not stop thinking of Nancy Lammeter．He felt sure that with Nancy as his wife he would not need to have secrets，and could be open and honest with everybody．But for the moment he had to give Dunstan whatever he wanted，keep Molly happy，and lie to his father and his friends．If he told his father the truth，the situation would become impossible．The Squire would disinherit him and he would be just a poor working man for the rest of his life．And far worse than that，he would lose any hope of marrying Nancy．No！He could not accept that．He would find the money for Dunstan，and wait for the situa－tion to get better．Living with fear in his heart，the fear of be－ing discovered，was better than living without Nancy's love．</p>
<p>戈弗雷犹豫了，他知道自从错误地和莫丽结婚以后，自己就掉进了邓斯坦的陷阱。邓斯坦把戈弗雷介绍给莫丽，就是想让他爱上她并娶她。邓斯坦显然很得意自己的计划能够成功。戈弗雷现在处于困难的境地，他不再爱他的年轻妻子，也不能停止想念南茜&middot;拉默特。他深信如果南茜成为自己的妻子，他就不再需要保守什么秘密，可以诚实、坦率地去面对每一个人。但现在邓斯坦要什么，他就得给什么，必须让莫丽高兴，并且必须对父亲和朋友们撒谎。如果向父亲说出实情，情况将不可想像，自己会被父亲取消继承权，会像一个可怜的工人一样过完下半辈子。更糟糕的是，自己将再不可能娶到南茜了。不，他不会接受这一切！他要给邓斯坦找钱，等待事情好转。怀着怕被发现的恐惧活着，总比得不到南茜的爱活着要强。</p>
<p>He turned to Dunstan．'It's just like you to talk of selling Wildfire—the best horse I've ever had！'</p>
<p>他转向邓斯坦。“卖掉野火——我最好的马，这正是你的行径！”</p>
<p>'Let me sell him for you-you know I'm good at buying and selling．I can ride him to the hunt for you tomorrow，and bring you back the money．But you must decide．You lent me that money，and you'll have to pay it back to the Squire．So it's your problem，not mine！'</p>
<p>“让我替你去卖——你知道我善做买卖。明天我会把它骑到狩猎会，然后带钱回来给你。不过这必须由你来决定。钱你已经借给我了，你得去还给父亲，所以这是你的问题而不是我的。”</p>
<p>Godfrey thought for a moment．'All right，'he said．'But make sure you bring me back all the money，Dunstan！'</p>
<p>戈弗雷想了一会儿。“好吧，”他说，“不过你必须把所有的钱拿回来给我！”</p>
<p>The next morning，as Dunstan was riding Wildfire out of Rav－eloe，he passed the old quarry．All the stone had been taken out of it and it was no longer used；now all that was left was a deep hole full of reddish water．Opposite the quarry was Silas Marn－er's cottage．Dunstan suddenly had an idea．'Everybody in Raveloe talks of the weaver's money—he must have a lot hid－den away in that cottage！Why doesn't Godfrey borrow some money from him，and pay him back when he becomes the Squire？'He wondered whether to go back to the Red House at once，to tell Godfrey about this wonderful idea of his，but he did not want to miss the hunt，so he decided to continue on his way．</p>
<p>第二天早晨，邓斯坦骑着野火离开瑞福洛时，从老采石场经过。所有的石头都已经被采走，采石场已经废弃多时，现在只剩一个满是红水的大深洞了。西拉斯&middot;马南的草屋就在采石场的对面。邓斯坦忽然有了个主意。“瑞福洛的每个人都在谈论织布匠的钱——他一定在草屋里藏了很多钱。戈弗雷干嘛不向他借点儿，等成了乡绅后再还给他呢？”他犹豫了一下是不是马上回去把自己的好主意告诉戈弗雷，但最后还是决定继续赶路，因为他不想错过狩猎会。</p>
<p>At the hunt he met several friends and neighbours，and be fore the hunt started he managed to sell Wildfire for a good price．The money would be paid when he brought the horse to the neighbour's house later that day．Dunstan knew it would be safer to take the horse there immediately，so that he could be sure of receiving the money．But he was confident that he could take care of Wildfire during the hunt，and so，after a glass or two of whisky，he joined the other riders in the fields．This time，however，he was not as lucky as usual，and horse and rid-er fell while jumping a gate．Dunstan got up，shaken but unhurt，but poor Wildfire's back was broken，and in a few mo－ments he died．</p>
<p>在狩猎会，邓斯坦遇到了几个朋友和邻居，在狩猎会开始前他已经把野火卖了个好价钱，说好晚些时候把马送到邻居家里再拿钱。邓斯坦知道马上把马送去更安全，这样他肯定能拿到钱。但他相信自己在狩猎会上能照料好马。于是，喝了一两杯威士忌启，他加入了其他狩猎者的行列。不幸的是，这次邓斯坦没有平时幸运，在跳过一个篱笆门时，马和骑手都摔倒了。邓斯坦站了起来，摔得够呛但没伤着，而可怜的野火的背却摔断了，几分钟后，它死了。</p>
<p>Dunstan looked around，and was glad to see that no other riders had noticed his accident．He did not want people to think he was a bad rider．He did not care much about Wildfire，be－cause he thought he now had a much better plan to offer God－frey．The worst thing was that he would have to walk home，something he was not at all used to doing．</p>
<p>邓斯坦看看四周，很高兴没有别的骑手注意到他的事故，他不想让人觉得他是个不好的骑手。他并不在乎野火，因为他觉得他有更好的主意提供给戈弗雷。最麻烦的是他得步行回家了，这可是他一点儿也不习惯的。</p>
<p>He drank some more whisky from the bottle he kept in his pocket，and started down the country road．He kept thinking about Silas's money．There would certainly be enough for his own needs as well as Godfrey's．Dunstan thought it would be easy to frighten the weaver a little，and then Silas would quick－ly agree to lend his money．</p>
<p>又喝了些身上酒瓶里的酒，邓斯坦踏上了回家的乡村小路。他一直在想西拉斯的钱，那些钱肯定够哥哥和自己用的了。邓斯坦相信很容易就能吓住织布匠，让他把钱借出来。</p>
<p>It was four o'clock in the afternoon，and the whole country－side was covered by a thick mist．Dunstan did not see anyone on his way back to Raveloe．He knew he was getting close to the old quarry，although he could not see the road in front of him．At last he saw light coming from the weaver's cottage，and he decided to knock at the door．'Why not ask the old man for the money now？he thought．</p>
<p>这时是下午4点，整个村野都被浓雾笼罩着。邓斯坦在回瑞福洛的路上没有看到一个人。虽然看不见前面的路，但他知道自己已经接近老采石场了。终于看到了织布匠屋里的灯光，他决定去敲门。“为什么不现在就去向老头儿借钱？”他想。</p>
<p>But when he knocked loudly，there was no reply．And when he pushed the door，it opened．Dunstan found himself in front of a bright fire which showed every corner of the small living-room．Silas Marner was not there．Dunstan was tired and cold，so he went quickly to sit by the warm fire．As he sat down，he noticed a small piece of meat cooking over the fire．It was hanging from a large door key．</p>
<p>他大声敲门的时候，屋里没有人答应，推了推，门开了。邓斯坦进到了一个被炉火照亮了每一个角落的小屋里，西拉斯&middot;马南不在家。邓斯坦觉得又冷又累，赶紧在暖和的炉火前坐下。坐下时，他发现一小片肉吊在一把大钥匙上，在火上烤着。</p>
<p>'So，the old man's cooking meat for his supper，is he？'thought Dunstan．'But where is he？Why is his door unlocked？Perhaps he went out to fetch some wood for the fire，and fell into the quarry！Perhaps he's dead！'this was an interesting new idea．'And if he's dead，who inherits his mon－ey？Who would know that anybody had come to take it away？'And the most important question of all—'Where is the money？'</p>
<p>“这是老家伙为自己烧的晚饭吧！”邓斯坦想，“他去哪儿了？为什么不锁门？也许出去运柴火，结果掉采石场里了！没准他死了！”这是个有趣的新想法。“如果他死了，谁继承他的钱？谁会知道有人来过把钱拿走了？”可更重要的问题是——“钱在哪儿？”</p>
<p>Dunstan's excitement made him forget that the weaver could still be alive．He wanted Silas to be dead，and he wanted Silas's money．He looked round the cottage again．There was very little furniture，just a bed，the loom，three chairs and a table．Dunstan looked under the bed，but the money was not there．Then he noticed a plsce on the floor，near the loom，where the floorboards looked different．By pulling up one of the boards，he discovered Silas's hiding－place．He took out the two heavy bags filled with gold，put the boards back and hurried to the door．</p>
<p>兴奋使邓斯坦忘了织布匠有可能还活着。他希望西拉斯死了，他希望得到西拉斯的钱。于是他重新看看小屋，家具很少，只有一张床、织布机、三把椅子和一张桌子。看看桌子下面，钱不在。邓斯坦注意到织布机旁边地上的一个地方，地板看起来有些特别，扒开一块板，他发现了西拉斯的藏钱之处。他取出两个装满金币的袋子，把板盖好，急忙跑向屋门。</p>
<p>Outside，the rain was falling heavily，and he could not see anything at all．Carrying the heavy bags，he stepped forward into the darkness．</p>
<p>外面的雨下得很大，邓斯坦什么也看不见。拿着沉沉的袋子，他走进黑暗之中。</p><a href='3.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
