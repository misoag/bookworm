<p><b>5 西拉斯的邻居们 </b></p>
<p>In the weeks following the robbery，the police tried hard to find the pedlar，because so many people suspected him of being the thief．But there was no sign of him in any of the towns and villages round Raveloe．</p>
<p>失窃案后的几周里，因为那么多人都怀疑那个小贩是贼，警察就费了很大劲查找他，但是在瑞福洛周围的村子和镇子里都找不到他的踪影。</p>
<p>Nobody was surprised at Dunstan Cass's absence．Once be-fore he had stayed away for six weeks and then come back．No-body imagined he could have anything to do with the robbery．The villagers continued to discuss Silas and his lost gold，but they had no more explanations to offer．</p>
<p>没有人对邓斯坦&middot;凯斯的失踪表示奇怪，以前有一次他曾离家6周以后才回来。没人想到他会和失窃案有关。村民们仍在谈论西拉斯和他丢了的金子，可人们都找不到更新的解释。</p>
<p>Silas himself still had his loom and his work，so he went on weaving But the only thing that had made his life worth living had gone，and now he had nothing to look forward to．A life－time of empty evenings lay ahead of him． He did not enjoy thinking of the money he would earn，because it reminded him of the money he had lost．As he sat weaving，he sometimes used to moan quietly to himself．And in the evenings，as he sat alone in front of the fire，he used to put his head in his hands and moan again．</p>
<p>至于西拉斯本人，他还有他的织布机和他的工作，所以他继续织布。可是生活中唯一有价值的东西失去了，他不再有什么可期望的了。今后的一生将只有空虚的夜晚。他不再喜欢去想将要挣到的钱．那会使他想起丢失的钱。坐着干活的时候，他有时会对自己呻吟。晚上，一个人坐在炉火前，他也常会用手抱着头痛苦地呻吟。</p>
<p>But this disaster had one good result．Little by little，Silas's neighbours realized it was wrong to be suspicious of him． He was just a poor，simple，harmless man，who needed their help．</p>
<p>不过他的灾难也有一个好的结果。慢慢地，邻居们认识到以前对西拉斯的怀疑是不对的。他只是一个穷困、简单、无恶意的人，需要他们的帮助。</p>
<p>They showed their new opinion of him in many different ways．Some of the women，who were baking cakes and preparing meat for Christmas，brought him presents of food．Some of the men，who had nothing to give him，stopped him in the village to ask about his health，or visited him to discuss the robbery．They often finished their conversation by saying cheerfully，'Now you're the same as the rest of us—we're poor too！Cheer up，Master Marner！If you get ill and can't work any more，the Squire'll give you food and your neigh－bours will take care of you．'this did not make Silas feel better，but he realized it was meant kindly．</p>
<p>他们通过许多不同的方式表达对马南的新看法。有的妇女会在准备圣诞晚餐或者烤面包时送给他一些食物，那些没什么可给他的男人也会在村里叫住他问候他或者到小屋来看他，和他聊关于失窃案的事。谈话结束的时候他们通常会愉快地说：“现在你和我们这些人一样了——我们也是穷人！高兴起来，马南师傅！如果你病了，不能再工作了，乡绅会给你食物，邻居们会照顾你。”这些虽然不能让西拉斯感觉好受些，但他知道这是好意。</p>
<p>Old Mr Macey，the church clerk，came to the cottage one day，to explain how his opinion of the weaver had changed．</p>
<p>有一天，执事老麦西先生到小屋来解释他对于织布匠看法的改变。</p>
<p>'You see，Master Marner，'he said in his high old voice，'I used to think you worked for the devil—you've always looked strange，you know．But now I'm sure you're not evil，just a lit-tle bit crazy．That's what I tell the neighbours．'</p>
<p>“你知道，马南师傅，”他用苍老的高音说，“我以前以为你为魔鬼工作——你知道你老是看起来怪怪的。可现在我肯定你不邪恶，只是有一点儿古怪，我就是这么对邻居们讲的。”</p>
<p>He stopped to give Silas time to reply，but the weaver did not speak．He was sitting with his head in his hands as usual．He knew that the old man was trying to be kind，but he was too miserable to show any interest．</p>
<p>他停下来等西拉斯回答，可西拉斯没有出声，只是像平常一样用手抱着头坐着，他知道这个老人在试图表示友好，不过他实在是太沮丧了，没有兴趣。</p>
<p>'Come，Master Marner， what's your answer to that？'asked Mr Macey， a little impatiently．</p>
<p>“怎么样，马南师傅，你对我说的怎么看？”麦西先生有点儿不耐烦了。</p>
<p>'Oh，'said Silas，slowly lifting his head，'thank you． Thank you for your kindness．'</p>
<p>“噢，”西拉斯慢慢抬起头，“谢谢你，谢谢你的好意。”</p>
<p>'That's all right，'replied the old man，pleased． 'Now， you shouldn't sit here moaning，you know． Here's my advice to you．Ask Tookey in the village to make you a Sunday suit—I don't expect you've got one—and then you can come to church with your neighbours．It'll make you feel better．You're not an old man yet，although you look like one． How old were you when you came here first？ Twenty-five？'</p>
<p>“没什么，”老头儿高兴了，“我看你不应该再坐在这儿呻吟了。听听我的意见吧。去找村里的图齐给你做一件礼拜服——我想你一定没有礼拜服——然后和邻居一块儿到教堂来。这样你会好受些。你虽然看着像个老头，可实际上不老。你到这儿时多大？ 25？”</p>
<p>'I don't remember，'answered Silas，shaking his head．</p>
<p>“我不记得了。”西拉斯摇着头回答。</p>
<p>That evening，Mr Macey told a number of villagers at the Rainbow，'Poor Master doesn't know how old he is！And I don't suppose he knows what day of the week it is！He really is a bit crazy．'</p>
<p>这天晚上，麦西先生在酒馆对好多村民宣布：“可怜的马南师傅竟然不知道自己多大！我想他也不会知道今天星期几！他真是有点儿疯。”</p>
<p>Another villager，Dolly Winthrop，was also worried about Silas's absence from church．She was a large，fresh-faced wom－an with a sweet，patient smile，who was always busy from early morning until late at night，and who went to church herself ev－ery Sunday．She believed in helping her neighbours，and if someone in Raveloe was ill or dying，Dolly was often asked to take care of the patient．This good，sensible woman decided that Silas needed her help．So one Sunday afternoon she took her son Aaron，a pretty little boy of seven， to visit the weaver．As they came closer to the cottage，they heard the sound of the loom．</p>
<p>另一个村民多莉&middot;温思罗普也在为西拉斯不去教堂而担心。这是个气色很好的高大女人，有着温柔、耐心的笑容。她每天从清早忙到深夜，每周日必到教堂礼拜。她把帮助邻居当作自己的责任，村里有人生病或生命垂危，人们总是请她去看护病人。这位善良、聪明的女人觉得西拉斯需要她的帮助，于是，一个礼拜天的下午，多莉带着7岁的儿子阿荣，一个漂亮的小家伙，来看望织布匠。走近小屋，他们听到织布机的声音。</p>
<p>'Oh dear！Working on a Sunday！That's bad！'said Mrs Winthrop sadly．She had to knock loudy on the door before Silas heard．He said nothing，but opened the door to let them in，and Dolly sat down in an armchair．</p>
<p>“天哪！礼拜日还工作！这可不好。”温思罗普太太难过地说。她使劲敲门，西拉斯才能听到。他默默地开门让客人进来，多莉坐到一把扶手椅里。</p>
<p>'I was baking yesterday，Master Marner，'she said， 'and I've brought you some of my cakes．Here they are．'</p>
<p>“我昨天烤了面包，马南师傅，”她说，“今天给你带了些来。喏。”</p>
<p>'Thank you，'replied Silas，taking the little bag of cakes Dolly was holding out to him．Aaron was hiding behind his mother's chair，in childish fear of the weaver．</p>
<p>“谢谢你！”西拉斯接过多莉递给他的袋子。阿荣躲在妈妈的椅子后面，他还有些害怕织布匠。</p>
<p>'You didn't hear the church bells this morning，perhaps，Master Marner？'dolly asked gently．'This cottage is a long way from the village．'</p>
<p>“你今天早晨或许没听到教堂的钟声，马南师傅？”多莉轻轻地问，“这个小屋离村里太远了。”</p>
<p>'Yes，I heard them，'answered Silas．For him Sunday bells did not mean anything．There had been no bells at the Light Street chapel．</p>
<p>“我听见了，”西拉斯回答，礼拜日的钟声对他没有任何含意，日光街小教堂没钟。</p>
<p>'Oh！'said Dolly．'But—but do you have to work on a Sun－day？ You could make Sunday different from the other days，you know， by washing yourself，and cooking a little piece of meat，and going to church．And Master Marner，Christmas Day will be here soon！If you put on your best clothes and go to church and see the flowers and hear the singing，you'll feel much better！You'll know there is Someone you can trust！'</p>
<p>“噢！”多莉说，“可——可你一定要在礼拜日工作吗？你可以把礼拜日搞得和平时不同一些，你也知道，可以洗洗澡，烤块肉，然后上教堂去。而且马南师傅，马上要到圣诞节了！如果穿上最好的衣服到教堂去看看花，听听歌，你会感觉好多了！你会知道那里有你可以信赖的人！”</p>
<p>Dolly did not usually talk so much，but the matter seemed extremely important to her．</p>
<p>多莉平时话并不多，可这事对她很重要。</p>
<p>'No，no，'silas replied．'I don't know anything about church．I've never been to church．'</p>
<p>“不，不，”西拉斯回答，“我不懂教堂的事，我从没去过教堂。”</p>
<p>'Never been！'repeated Dolly．'Were there no churches in the town you were born in？'</p>
<p>“从没去过！”多莉重复道，“你出生的城镇没有教堂吗？”</p>
<p>'Oh yes，'said Silas，'there were a lot of churches．It was a big town，you see．But I only ever went to chapel．'</p>
<p>“有，”西拉斯回答，“有很多教堂，因为那是个大镇子，可我只去小教堂。”</p>
<p>Dolly did not understand this word，but was afraid of asking any more questions，in case 'chapel'meant something evil．After considering carefully for a moment，she said，'Well，Master Marner，it's never too late to start going to church．It's very pleasant listening to the singing and the good words．If we go to church，rhen when trouble comes，Someone will take care of us．And if we do our best，then I believe Someone will help us when we need help．'</p>
<p>多莉不懂这个词，可又不敢再多问，她生怕这个“小教堂”与魔鬼有关。仔细想了一会儿，她说：“马南师傅，什么时候开始上教堂都不算晚，听圣歌和赞美诗的感觉好极了。如果我们经常做礼拜，在有困难的时候，就会有人来帮助我们。只要我们尽力去做，我相信我们会在需要的时候得到帮助的。”</p>
<p>Dolly's explanation of her simple religion did not seem at all clear to Silas，but he did understand that she was asking him to go to church．He did not want to agree to that．Just then young Aaron came out from behind his mother's chair，and Silas of-fered him one of Dolly's cakes．</p>
<p>虽然听不太懂多莉对自己简单信仰的解释，可西拉斯知道她在劝说自己去教堂。但他不想照着去做。正在这时阿荣从妈妈的椅子后面出来了，西拉斯给了他一块多莉做的蛋糕。</p>
<p>'Oh Aaron！'said his mother．'You're always eating！No，don't give him any more，Master Marner．But he can sing a song for you．I'm sure you'll like it．It's a beautiful Christmas carol．Come，Aaron，let's hear it．'</p>
<p>“嗨，阿荣！”他妈妈叫道，“你总在吃！不，马南师傅，别再给他了。不过他可以给你唱首歌，我想你会喜欢，这是一首圣诞颂歌。来，阿荣，唱给我们听听。”</p>
<p>Little Aaron stood up straight and sang his carol in a clear，sweet voice．Dolly listened with delight，hoping that the carol would help to persuade Silas to come to church．</p>
<p>小阿荣站直了，开始用清晰、甜美的声音唱他的颂歌。多莉高兴地听着，希望歌声能有助于劝说西拉斯去教堂。</p>
<p>'You see，Master Marner，'she said when Aaron had fin－ished，'that's Christmas music．The Christmas Day service is wonderful，with all the voices and the music．I hope you'll be there with us．And remember，if you feel ill，I'll be happy to come and cook or clean for you．But I beg you，please stop weaving on Sundays．It's bad for soul and body，I'm sure．We must go now．Goodbye，Master Marner．'</p>
<p>“你看，马南师傅，”阿荣唱完她说，“这就是圣诞音乐，圣诞节的礼拜仪式棒极了，有各种声音和音乐。我希望你和我们一起在教堂。记住，如果你不舒服，我很乐意来替你做饭，打扫，但我请求你不要在礼拜日工作。我肯定这对灵魂和肉体都有害。我们得走了。再见，马南师傅。”</p>
<p>'Thank you，and goodbye，'said Silas，as he opened the door for them．He could not help feeling relieved when she had gone．Now he could weave and moan as much as he liked．</p>
<p>“谢谢你，再见。”西拉斯为他们打开门。客人走后他不禁感到很轻松，因为他又可以织布，可以想怎么呻吟就怎么呻吟了。</p>
<p>Mr Macey and Dolly had tried hard to persuade Silas to go to church．But in the end he spent Christmas Day alone in his cot－tage，looking out at the cold grey sky．In the evening，snow be－gan to fall，and he felt more distant and separate from his neighbours than ever．He sat in his robbed home，moaning mis－erably to himself，not noticing that his fire was no longer burn－ing and that he was getting cold．</p>
<p>麦西先生和多莉尽了很大努力想劝西拉斯去教堂，可圣诞日西拉斯还是一个人留在了小屋里，望着窗外冷冷的灰色天空。晚上，开始下雪了，他感到跟邻居们距离更远，更孤独了。他坐在被偷过的家里，对自己痛苦地呻吟着，没注意到火炉里的火已经熄了，自己也越来越冷。</p>
<p>But in Raveloe the church bells were ringing and the church was fuller than all through the rest of the year．It was a special day for everybody，and after the service they all hurried home in the biting cold to eat and drink with their families．</p>
<p>此时，瑞福洛的教堂的钟声在响，教堂里比平时任何时候人都多。对每个人这都是特别的一天，仪式完毕人们都在刺骨的寒冷中匆匆赶回家和家人一起吃喝庆祝。</p>
<p>At the Red House nobody spoke of Dunstan's absence．The village doctor，Dr Kimble，and his wife were guests there for Christmas lunch，and the day passed happily．</p>
<p>红屋里没人提起邓斯坦的缺席。乡村医生金布尔先生和他太太被请来一起吃午饭，这一天过得很愉快。</p>
<p>The servants，however，were already preparing for the New Year's Eve dance which Squire Cass gave every year．It was the best party of the year，and guests used to come from miles around．Godfrey was looking forward to this year's party more than usual．But he was still worried．</p>
<p>用人们已经开始准备乡绅凯斯每年主办的新年夜舞会了。这是一年中最好的晚会，方圆几里地的客人都会来。戈弗雷比往年都更盼着新年晚会。可他也有一点儿担心。</p>
<p>'What if Dunstan returns？'he thought．'He'll tell the Squire about my secret marriage！And Molly's asking for more money！I'll have to sell something for cash．But on New Year's Eve，I can forget everything for an evening，and sit with Nancy，and look into her eyes，and dance with her…'</p>
<p>“邓斯坦回来怎么办？”他想，“他会向父亲告发我的秘密婚姻！莫丽又在要更多的钱！我将不得不卖些东西换钱。不过新年之夜我可以暂时忘掉这一切，我要坐在南茜旁边，看着她的眼睛，和她跳舞……”</p><a href='6.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
