<p><b>9 戈弗雷终于坦白了 </b></p>
<p>At the Red House Nancy was waiting patiently for God－frey to come home to tea．Suddenly one of the servants ran into the sitting-room，crying excitedly，'Madam，there are lots of people in the street！They're all running the same way，towards the quarry！Perhaps there's been an accident！'</p>
<p>红屋里，南茜正在耐心地等着戈弗雷回家来喝茶，突然一个用人闯进客厅，兴奋地喊：“夫人，街上有好多人！大家全都在向采石场跑！可能出什么事儿了！”</p>
<p>'Jane，don't get so excited，'replied Nancy calmly．'I ex-pect it's nothing serious．Go and get the tea ready．Mr Godfrey will be back soon．'But secretly she was saying to herself，'I hope nothing's happened to Godfrey！'</p>
<p>“简，别那么激动，”南茜平静地说，“我想不会有什么重要的事。去拿茶来，戈弗雷先生快回来了。”可她心里对自己说，“千万别是戈弗雷有什么事儿！”</p>
<p>So when he came into the room，a few minutes later，she was very relieved．'My dear，I'm so thankful you've come，'she said，going towards him．'I was beginning to think—'</p>
<p>几分钟后，当戈弗雷进屋时，她长出了一口气。“亲爱的，谢天谢地，你回来了！”她走上前，“我开始在想……”</p>
<p>She stopped suddenly when she saw Godfrey's shaking hands and white face．She put her hand on his arm，but he did not seem to notice，and threw himself into a chair．</p>
<p>她猛地停了下来。她看到戈弗雷双手发抖，脸色惨白。南茜把手放在他臂上，可他好像没感觉。他跌坐在一把椅子上。</p>
<p>'Sit down—Nancy，'he said with difficulty．'I came back as soon as I could，to prevent anyone telling you except me． It's terrible news for me， but I'm more worried about how you will feel about it．'</p>
<p>“坐下——南茜，”他艰难地说，“我尽可能快地赶回来，我真怕别人来告诉你。这对我是个可怕的消息，可我更担心你会怎么想。”</p>
<p>'It isn't father or Priscilla？'said Nancy，trying to control her trembling lips．</p>
<p>“是爸爸或普丽西拉吗？”南茜努力克制着嘴唇的抖动。</p>
<p>'No，it's nobody living，'said Godfrey．'It's Dunstan，my brother，who left home sixteen years ago and never came back．We've found him…found his body—all that's left of it—in the old quarry．</p>
<p>“不，不关活人的事儿，”戈弗雷说，“是我弟弟邓斯坦，他从16年前离家后一直没有回来。我们找到他了……找到了他的尸体——所有剩下的部分——在采石场里。”</p>
<p>Nancy felt calmer now．That was not terrible news．</p>
<p>南茜平静多了，这并不是太可怕的消息。</p>
<p>'You know the men have been draining our fields near the quarry．Well，as a result， the quarry has suddenly gone dry，and we've found him lying at the bottom． We know it's him be－cause he's wearing his watch and his rings．'</p>
<p>“你知道我让人给我们采石场边上那几块地排水，结果采石场一下子被排干了，我们在坑底发现了他的尸体。我们从手表和戒指认出那是他。”</p>
<p>Godfrey paused．It was not easy to say what came next．</p>
<p>戈弗雷停了下来。要说出后面的事儿很不容易。</p>
<p>'Do you think he drowned himself？'asked Nancy，wonder－ing why her husband was so shaken by the death of a brother he had never loved．</p>
<p>“他是自杀吗？”南茜不明白丈夫为什么会对那个他从来没喜欢过的弟弟的死而这样难过。</p>
<p>'No，he fell in，'replied Godfrey in a low voice．'Dunstan was the man who robbed Silas Marner．The bags of gold were found with his body．'</p>
<p>“不，他失足掉下去的，”戈弗雷低声说，“邓斯坦是那个偷西拉斯钱的人，从他身上找到了钱袋子。”</p>
<p>'Oh Godfrey！I am sorry！'said Nancy．She understood how ashamed her husband must be．The Casses were so proud of their family name．</p>
<p>“噢，戈弗雷！我太难过了！”她知道丈夫一定感到非常耻辱。凯斯家族的荣誉是至高无尚的。</p>
<p>'I had to tell you．I couldn't keep it from you，'Godfrey continued，and then stopped，looking at the ground for two long minutes．Nancy knew that he had something more to say．Finally Godfrey lifted his eyes to her face，and said，'Every－body's secrets are discovered sooner or later，Nancy．I've lived with a secret ever since I married you，but I'm going to confess it now．I don't want you to discover it from someone else，or hear about it when I'm dead，I was weak and hesitating when I was younger—I'm going to be firm with myself now．'</p>
<p>“我得告诉你，我不能向你隐瞒，”戈弗雷停下来，眼睛盯着地板看了两分钟。南茜知道他还有话要说。终于戈弗雷抬起了眼看着南茜的脸，说：“每个人的秘密早晚都会被发现，南茜。我们结婚以后我一直隐藏着一个秘密，现在我要把它向你坦白。我不想让你从别人那里发现它，或是在我死了以后再听到它。年轻的时候我脆弱而且优柔寡断——现在我要坚强起来。”</p>
<p>Nancy could not speak．She stared at her husband in horror．What secret could he possibly have from her？</p>
<p>南茜害怕地看着丈夫，什么也说不出。他会隐瞒了什么呢？</p>
<p>'Nancy，'said Godfrey slowly，'when I married you，I hid something from you—I was wrong not to tell you．That woman Silas Marner found dead in the snow—Eppie's moth er—that poor woman—was my wife．Eppie is my child．'</p>
<p>“南茜，”戈弗雷慢慢地说，“娶你的时候，我隐瞒了些东西——我很不应该不告诉你。那个被西拉斯发现死在雪地上的可怜女人——埃比的妈妈——是我的妻子。埃比是我的孩子。”</p>
<p>He paused，looking worriedly at Nancy．But she sat quite still，although her face looked rather white．</p>
<p>他停下来，担心地看着南茜，可她仍然静静地坐着，只是脸更白了。</p>
<p>Perhaps you won't be able to love me any more，'he said，his voice trembling a little．</p>
<p>“你也许不会再爱我了。”他的声音有些发抖。</p>
<p>She was silent．</p>
<p>她沉默着。</p>
<p>I was wrong，I know I was wrong to marry Molly and then to keep it a secret．But I loved you，Nancy，I only ever wanted to marry you．</p>
<p>“我错了，我知道我不该娶了莫丽而又不说出来。可我爱你，南茜，我只想娶你。”</p>
<p>Still Nancy was silent，looking down at her hands．And God frey almost expected her to get up and say she would leave him and go to live with her father and sister．She was so religious，and so firm in her ideas of right and wrong！</p>
<p>南茜看着自己的手，仍然沉默着。戈弗雷想她一定会站起来说她要离开他去和父亲和姐姐生活在一起。她是那么的虔诚，那么的是非分明！</p>
<p>But at last she lifted her eyes to his and spoke．She did not sound angry，but only sad．'Oh Godfrey，why didn't you tell me this long ago？ I didn't know Eppie was yours and so I re fused to adopt her．Of course I'd accept your child into our home！But—oh，Godfrey—how sad to think we've spent all these years with no children！Why didn't you confess the truth before we married？We could be so happy now，with a beautiful daughter，who would love me as her mother！'tears were running down Nancy's face But Nancy，'cried Godfrey，bitterly angry with himself，' I couldn't tell you everything！I was in danger of losing you if I told you the truth！'</p>
<p>但最后南茜抬眼看着戈弗雷，声音悲伤，但并不愤怒：“戈弗雷，你怎么能那么长时间不告诉我呢？我不知道埃比是你的女儿，所以不同意领养她。我当然应当接纳你的孩子来我们的家。哦，戈弗雷——这么多年没有孩子是多不容易呀！为什么结婚前你不告诉我实情？那样我们多快活，会有一个漂亮的女儿，她会像爱她的妈妈那样爱我！”泪水顺着南茜的脸颊流了下来。</p>
<p>'I don't know about that，Godfrey．I certainly never want－ed to marry anyone else But it wasn't worth doing wrong just so that you could marry me．And our marriage hasn't been as happy for you as you thought it would be There was a sad smile on Nancy's face as she said the last words．</p>
<p>“可是南茜，”戈弗雷对自己很气恼，“我不能告诉你这些！我怕说了实话我就会失去你！”“我也不知道，戈弗雷，我从没想过要嫁给别人，可你不值得为娶我而做错事，而且我们的婚姻也不像你想的那么幸福。”说到最后南茜苦笑了一下。</p>
<p>'Can you ever forgive me for what I've done，Nancy？</p>
<p>“你能宽恕我所做的吗，南茜？”</p>
<p>You have only hurt me a little，Godfrey，and you've been a good husband to me for fifteen years But it's the other wom－an who you've hurt the most，and I don't see how you can put that right．'</p>
<p>“你对我的伤害并不严重，况且你已经做了15年的好丈夫。可你对另一个女人的伤害最重，我不知道你能怎么去弥补。”</p>
<p>But we can take Eppie into our home now，'said Godfrey．</p>
<p>“我们可以去把埃比接到家里来。”戈弗雷说。</p>
<p>'It'll be different now that she's grown up，'said Nancy，shaking her head sadly．'It'll be more difficult for her to get used to us．But it's our duty to take care of your child，and I'll ask God to make her love me．</p>
<p>“这并不那么容易，因为她已经长大了，”南茜悲哀地摇着头，“接受我们对她更难。可我们有义务去照料你的孩子，我会求上帝让她爱我。”</p>
<p>Then we'll go to the weaver's cottage tonight，'said God－frey，'and talk to Marner and Eppie about it．'</p>
<p>“那我们今晚就去织布匠的家，”戈弗雷说，“去对西拉斯和埃比说。”</p><a href='10.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
