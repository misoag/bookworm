<p><b>2 名片 </b></p>
<p>So next day, at seven o'clock, I came to the shop in a cab. There were not very many people in the road, be－cause it was early in the morning. In November it is dark at seven o'clock in the morning, and I could not see the shop very well. I waited five minutes. A postman walked past. Then the door of the shop opened, and the creature, Merrick , came out.</p>
<p>第二天七点钟，我乘着马车来到这家商店。天刚刚亮，路上没有多少人。十一月份的早上七点钟天还是黑的，商店还看不太清楚。我等了五分钟，一个邮递员恰好经过，后来商店门开了，那个怪物——麦里克出来了。</p>
<p>I could not see his face or his body. He had an enormous black hat on his head, like a big box. A grey cloth came down from the hat, in front of his face. There was a hole in the cloth in front of his eyes. He could see out of the hole but I could not see in. He wore a long black coat, too. The coat began at his neck, and ended at his feet, so I could not see his arms, his body, or his legs. On his feet he wore big shoes, like old bags.</p>
<p>我看不见他的脸和身体，他头上戴着一顶大黑帽子，就像顶着一个大盒子。帽子上搭着一块灰色的布一直遮着脸，眼睛前面的布上有个洞，他可以从洞里朝外看，可我却看不见里面。他还穿了一件黑色的长外套，外套从颈子上一直拖到脚下，所以我看不见他的手臂、身体和腿。他脚上穿着一双大鞋，就像两条旧口袋。</p>
<p>He had a stick in his left hand, and he walked very slowly. I opened the door of the cab, and got out.</p>
<p>他左手拿着一根拐杖，走得很慢，我打开车门，走了出来。</p>
<p>'Good morning, Mr Merrick, 'I said. 'Can you get in？'</p>
<p>“早上好，麦里克先生，”我说，“你能上去吗？”</p>
<p>'Elpmyupasteps, 'he said.</p>
<p>“Elpmyupasteps.他说。</p>
<p>'I'm sorry, 'I said. 'I don't understand. '</p>
<p>“对不起，”我说，“我听不懂。”</p>
<p>For a minute he stood by the door of the cab and said nothing. Then he hit the cab with his stick.</p>
<p>他在车门边站了一会儿，什么话也没有说。后来他用拐杖敲了敲车子。</p>
<p>'STEPS! 'he said loudly. 'Help me up the steps! '</p>
<p>“上车。”他大声地说，“帮我上车。”</p>
<p>Then I understood. There were three steps up into the cab, and he could not get up them.</p>
<p>后来，我明白了，马车上有三级台阶，他迈不上去。</p>
<p>'Yes, I see. I'm sorry, 'I said. 'Let me help you. '</p>
<p>“噢，对不起，”我说，“我来帮你。”</p>
<p>I took his left hand and began to help him. My right hand was behind his back. I felt very strange. His left hand was like a young woman's, but his back under the coat, was horrible. I could feel the bags of old skin on his back under the coat.</p>
<p>我左手拉着他的左手，右手扶着他的背帮助他上车。我觉得很奇怪，他的左手就像年轻女人的手，而他外套里面的背部却是很可怕。我可以摸到外套里面背上那些老皮囊肿。</p>
<p>He put one enormous foot on the first step, and then he stopped. After a minute, he moved his second foot slowly. Then he stopped and waited again.</p>
<p>他一只大脚先迈上了头一个台阶，就停下了。过了一会儿，又慢慢地挪动另外一只脚，然后又停了下来再次等着。</p>
<p>'Hello, sir. Can I help you？'</p>
<p>“喂，先生，要我帮忙吗？”</p>
<p>I looked behind me. It was the postman. And behind him, I could see three young boys. One of the boys laughed.</p>
<p>我朝身后一看，是那位邮递员，在他的身后还有三个小男孩，其中有一个在大声笑着。</p>
<p>The postman smiled. 'Is the gentleman ill？'he asked.</p>
<p>这位邮递员微笑着问：“这位先生病了吗？”</p>
<p>I thought quickly. 'Yes. But this is a lady, not a gentle-man. I'm a doctor, and she's ill. Take her hand, so I can help her better. '</p>
<p>我灵机一动：“对，但这是位女士，不是先生。我是医生，她病了，拉着她的手，这样我能更好地帮助她。”</p>
<p>The postman took Merrick's left hand, and I helped him with two hands from behind. Slowly, very slowly, Merrick went up the steps and into the cab.</p>
<p>邮递员拉着麦里克的左手，我用双手从后面推他。麦里克慢慢地移动步子，走进马车。</p>
<p>One boy was very near the cab. He called to his friends. 'Come and see this, boys! A fat lady in a black coat! And look at that enormous hat! '</p>
<p>一个小男孩离马车很近，他对着他的伙伴们大声地喊着：“过来看，一个穿黑外套的胖女人！瞧那顶大帽子！”</p>
<p>The boys laughed. They were very near the cab too, now. I closed the door quickly. 'Thank you, 'I said to the postman.</p>
<p>孩们们哄笑着走到马车旁，我迅速地关上车门转身对邮递员说：“谢谢你。”</p>
<p>'That's all right, sir, 'he said. 'She's a strange lady, sir, isn't she？''She's ill, that's all, 'I said quickly. 'We're going to the hospital. Goodbye, and thank you. '</p>
<p>他说：“不用谢，先生。这位女士长得很怪呀！”我很快地回答：“她是病人。我们要去医院，谢谢你，再见。”</p>
<p>The cab drove down the road to the hospital. I locked at Merrick. 'That was difficult, wasn't it？'I said.</p>
<p>马车沿着去医院的路驶去。我看了看麦里克说：“很不容易，是吧？”</p>
<p>At first he said nothing, but then he spoke. His voice was very strange, but I listened to him carefully, and I could understand him.</p>
<p>他先是什么都不说，可后来他开口了，他的嗓音很怪，可我还是认真地听着，我能听懂他讲的意思。</p>
<p>'The steps were very difficult, 'he said. 'But most things are difficult for me. '</p>
<p>“上台阶很困难。”他说，“大多数事情对于我都很困难。”“对您来说没有容易的事，对吧？”</p>
<p>'Yes, 'I said. ' Nothing is easy for you, is it？''No, 'he said. He was very quiet for a minute. Then he said, 'Who are you, sir？'</p>
<p>“对。”他沉默了一会儿，然后问道：“您是谁，先生？”</p>
<p>'Who am I？Oh, I'm sorry, My name is Dr Treves. Here, this is my card. '</p>
<p>“我是谁？哦，对不起，我是特里维斯博士。瞧，这是我的名片。”</p>
<p>I gave him a card with my name on. Then I thought, 'That was no good. This man can't read. 'But Merrick took the card and looked at it very carefully. Then he put it in his trousers pocket.</p>
<p>我递给了他一张上面有我名字的名片。但转念一想，这没什么用，他不识字。麦里克拿着名片认真地看了看，然后就收进裤子口袋里。</p>
<p>I did not talk to him very much at the hospital. I looked at his head and arms and legs and body very carefully. Then I wrote the important things about him in a little book. A nurse helped me. Merrick looked at her sometimes, but she did not smile at him or talk to him. I think she was afraid of him. I think Merrick was afraid too, because he was very quiet.</p>
<p>在医院里我和他谈得不多，我很仔细地看过他的头、手臂、腿和身子，然后我将有关他的重要情况记在了一个小笔记本里。一位护士来协助我工作。麦里克时不时地朝她看看，可她既不朝他微笑也不与他说话。我想她是怕他，麦里克可能也怕她，因为他一直很安静。</p>
<p>At four o'clock I took him back to the shop in a cab. The next day I looked in the shop window again, but the picture was not there.</p>
<p>四点钟时，我用马车将他送回那个商店。第二天我又朝小店橱窗里看了看，可那张照片已不见了。</p><a href='3.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
