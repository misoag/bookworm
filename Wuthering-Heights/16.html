<p><b>16 凯茜成了寡妇 </b></p>
<p>1800—1 On the evening after the burial，Heathcliff came to fetch Cathy．</p>
<p>1880—1881年。葬礼后的当天晚上，希斯克利夫来领凯茜。</p>
<p>‘Why not let her stay here with me？’I begged．</p>
<p>“你就不能让凯茜和我在一起吗？”我乞求道。</p>
<p>‘I'm looking for someone to rent the Grange from me，’he answered．‘You'll stay on here as housekeeper，Ellen，but Cathy must come to Wuthering Heights．From now on she'll have to work for her food．’</p>
<p>“我在找人来租我的画眉山庄，”他回答，“你住在这儿做管家，艾伦，但凯茜必须来呼啸山庄。从现在起她要干活才有饭吃。”</p>
<p>‘I shall work，'replied Cathy．‘And I'll look after Linton．He's all I've got to love in the world．I'm just sorry for you，Mr Heathcliff．You have nobody to love you！You are as lonely and miserable as the devil！Nobody will cry for you when you die！I'm glad I'm not you！’</p>
<p>“我会干活的，”凯茜回答。“我来照顾林顿，他是这世上我唯一需要去爱的人。我只是为你感到难过，希斯克利夫先生。没有人爱你！你就像个鬼一样孤独痛苦！你死的时候没人会为你掉眼泪！我庆幸我不是你！”</p>
<p>‘Go and get your clothes，you wicked girl，’he said．‘We'll be leaving in a few minutes．’When she had gone，he walked across the room to look at the picture of Cathy's mother，Catherine，which was hanging on the wall．</p>
<p>“去取你的衣服，你这个混账丫头，”他说。“我们几分钟后就走。”她出去后，他走到房间的另一头，看着挂在墙上凯茜母亲凯瑟琳的画像。</p>
<p>‘Do you know what I did yesterday，Ellen？’he said，turning quickly away from the picture．‘I went to the churchyard，and asked the man who was digging Edgar's grave to open the lid of Catherine's coffin for me．Her face looked just the same！I could not stop looking at her．When the man closed the lid，I broke open one side of her coffin，the side away from Edgar's grave，and covered it up with earth．And I bribed the man to bury me there when I die，next to her，and to take the side of my coffin away too，so that I shall have her in my arms，not Edgar！’</p>
<p>“你知道昨天我干了什么，艾伦？”他很快把视线从画像上转回来说道，“我去了教堂墓地，让给艾加掘墓的人替我打开了凯瑟琳的棺材盖。她的面容看上去跟以前完全一样！我禁不住地盯着她看。那人盖上棺材后，我把她棺材不靠艾加墓的一面砸开了，然后用土埋上。我还收买了那个人，等我死后把我埋在那儿，埋在她旁边，我也要把我棺材的一面去掉，这样我就可以搂着她了，艾加不能！”</p>
<p>‘You were very wicked，Mr Heathcliff，to disturb the dead！’</p>
<p>“你真恶毒，希斯克利夫先生，去惊动死去的人！”</p>
<p>‘I disturbed nobody，Ellen，and I feel much happier now．She is the one who has disturbed me．For eighteen years she has haunted me．You know I was wild，almost mad，after she died．For days I prayed for her ghost to return to me．On the day of her burial，I went to her grave in the evening．There was a bitter wind，and snow on the ground．I wanted so much to have her in my arms again！So I dug down through the loose earth to her coffin，and was about to pull the lid off，when I felt a warm breath on my face．She seemed to be with me，not in the earth，but close to me．I was so happy that she was with me again！I filled in the grave，and ran eagerly home to the Heights．I looked impatiently round for her．I could feel her but I could not see her！And since then，she has played plenty of tricks on me like that．When I sleep in her bedroom，I can hear her outside the window，or entering the room，or even breathing close to me，but when I open my eyes，I'm always disappointed．Slowly，slowly，she's killing me，with the ghost of a hope that's lasted eighteen years！’</p>
<p>“我谁也没惊动，艾伦，我现在感觉高兴多了。她才是惊动了我的人。18年来她在索我的命。你知道，她死后我变得粗野，几乎发了疯。好几天我都在祈求她的鬼魂能回到我身边。在她下葬的那天，我晚上去了她的墓前。当时凄风阵阵，地上积着雪。我太想再把她抱在怀里啦！所以我挖开盖在她棺材上疏松的泥土，正想掀开盖子，突然觉得我的脸上有一股温暖的气息。她好像就在我身边，不在泥土里，而在紧靠着我。她又和我在一起了，我欣喜不已！我覆盖好坟墓，急冲冲地跑回呼啸山庄家里。我焦急地四下里找她。我能感觉到她，但看不见她！打那以后她如法炮制地屡次捉弄我。我睡在她房间的时候，我能听到她在窗外，或进了屋，或就在我身边呼吸，可当我一睁开眼，我总是失望。慢慢地、慢慢地，她用持续了18年之久的幽灵般飘渺的希望试图弄死我！”</p>
<p>He was talking almost to himself，so I did not answer．When Cathy came in，he stood up，ready to go．</p>
<p>他几乎是在自言自语，所以我也没有回答。凯茜进来了，他站起来，准备走。</p>
<p>‘Goodbye，Ellen！’whispered my dear little mistress．‘Come and visit me！’As she kissed me，her face felt as cold as ice．</p>
<p>“再见，艾伦！”我亲爱的小女主人小声说。“来看我！”她亲我的时候，我觉得她脸上冰凉。</p>
<p>‘Oh，no you won't，Ellen！'said Heathcliff．‘I'll send for you if I want you！’and together they left the Grange．</p>
<p>“噢，你不能，艾伦！”希斯克利夫说。“如果我需要你，我会派人来叫你的！”他们一起离开了画眉山庄。</p>
<p>I haven't seen Cathy since then．Once I went to the Heights to visit her，but I was not allowed to see her．About six weeks ago I had a long conversation with Zillah，the housekeeper，who gave me news of Cathy．It appeared that，when she ar rived at the Heights，she did her best to look after her sick husband．He was obviously dying，although Heathcliff refused to call the doctor．Only a few weeks after her arrival，Linton died in the night，with only Cathy by his bedside．Heathcliff inherited all of Linton's，and what had been Cathy's，fortune，so Cathy is now very poor．</p>
<p>此后我就没有见过凯茜。有一次我去呼啸山庄看她，但没让我见她。大概六个星期以前我和女管家齐拉长谈了一次，她跟我讲了凯茜的消息。看来在凯茜到呼啸山庄后一直尽心尽力照顾她生病的丈夫。很明显他快要死了，尽管如此，希斯克利夫还是不让找大夫。在她到呼啸山庄仅几个星期之后，林顿在夜里死了，当时只有凯茜陪在他床边。希斯克利夫继承了林顿的（原本是凯茜的）所有财产，所以现在凯茜一贫如洗。</p>
<p>She must be very miserable，and very lonely，in that dark，unpleasant house．Heathcliff hates her，and Joseph and Zillah don't speak to her，because they think she's too proud．Poor Hareton would like to be friendly with her，but she scorns him because he's uneducated．I would like to leave my job here，rent a little cottage and ask Cathy to come and live with me，but Mr Heathcliff will never permit that．Of course，if she married again，she could leave that house，but I can't arrange that．</p>
<p>在那栋阴暗、压抑的宅子里，她一定过得很痛苦、很孤独。希斯克利夫恨她，约瑟夫和齐拉也因为觉得她孤傲而不跟她说话。可怜的哈里顿想对她友善一点，可她又看不起他没教养。我愿意辞了这儿的工作，租上一间小农舍让凯茜来和我一起住，但希斯克利夫决不会答应的。当然，要是她再嫁人的话她就能离开那宅子，可要我安排我又无能为力。</p><a href='17.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
