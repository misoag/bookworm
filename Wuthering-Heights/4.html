<p><b>4 凯瑟琳&middot;欧肖认识了林顿一家 </b></p>
<p>1775 Hindley came home for his father's burial．What was more surprising was that he brought a wife with him．She was called Frances，a thin，pale woman with a frequent cough．Now that Hindley was the master of the house，he ordered Joseph and me to spend our evenings in the small back-kitchen，as we were only servants，while he，his wife and Catherine sat in the main room．Catherine and Heathcliff were treated very differently．Catherine received presents，and could continue her lessons，but Heathcliff was made to work on the farm with the men，and，as a farm worker，was only allowed to eat with us in the backkitchen．They grew up like two wild animals．Hindley did not care what they did，as long as they kept out of his way，and they did not care even if he punished them．They often ran away on to the moors in the morning and stayed out all day，just to make Hindley angry．I was the only one who cared what happened to the two poor creatures，and I was afraid for them．</p>
<p>1775年。亨德雷回家参加他父亲的葬礼。更令人惊奇的是他带回来个妻子。她叫弗朗西丝，是个瘦瘦的白白的女人，咳嗽个不停。这会儿亨德雷成了这宅子的主人，他责令约瑟夫和我晚上呆在后面的小厨房里，因为我们是下人，而他、他妻子和凯瑟琳则坐在正屋里。凯瑟琳和希斯克利夫的境遇大不相同。凯瑟琳收到了礼物，可以继续学习，但希斯克利夫被遣去与男人们一起在农庄干活，一个干农活的，只能被允许和我们在后面厨房里一起吃饭。他们俩像两个小野人似地长大了，亨德雷对他们的所作所为不闻不问，只要他们别碍着他的事；而他们就算被亨德雷惩罚也不吃他那一套。他们常常一大早就跑到荒原上，一整天都呆在外面，就是为了气气亨德雷。只有我才关心这两个可怜的小东西，替他们担惊受怕。</p>
<p>One Sunday evening they were missing at bedtime，and Hindley ordered me angrily to lock the front door．But I did not want them to stay out in the cold all night，so I kept my window open to look out for them．In a while I saw Heathcliff walking through the gate．I was shocked to see him alone．</p>
<p>一个星斯天的晚上，该睡觉的时候还没见他们人影，亨德雷怒冲冲地命令我锁上前门。但我不想他们大冷天整夜呆在外头，所以我就没关我的窗户，留意着他们。过了一会儿，我看到希斯克利夫走进了大门。见到只有他一个人，我大吃一惊。</p>
<p>‘Where's Catherine？’I cried sharply．</p>
<p>“凯瑟琳哪儿去了？”我尖声叫道。</p>
<p>‘At Thrushcross Grange，with our neighbours the Lintons，’he replied．‘Let me in，Ellen，and I'll explain what happened．’I went down to unlock the door，and we came upstairs very quietly．</p>
<p>“在画眉山庄，在我们的邻居林顿家，”他回答。“让我进去，艾伦，我会跟你解释是怎么回事。”我下去开了门，我们一声不响地走上楼。</p>
<p>‘Don't wake the master up！’I whispered．‘Now tell me！’</p>
<p>“别吵醒了主人！”我小声说。“现在说吧！”</p>
<p>‘Well，Catherine and I thought we’d just walk to the Lintons’house．We wanted to see if Isabella and Edgar Linton are punished all the time by their parents，as we are．’</p>
<p>“呃，凯瑟琳和我本打算走到林顿家，我们想看看伊莎贝拉和艾加&middot;林顿是不是也像我们这样天天受他们父母的罚。”</p>
<p>‘Probably not，’I answered．‘I expect they are good children and don't need to be punished．’</p>
<p>“八成不会，”我答道。“我想他们都是好孩子，没必要惩罚。”</p>
<p>‘Nonsense，Ellen！Guess what we saw when we looked in at their sittingroom window？A very pretty room，with soft carpets and white walls．Catherine and I would love to have a room like that！But in the middle of this beautiful room，Isabella and Edgar Linton were screaming and fighting over a little dog！How stupid they are，Ellen！If Catherine wanted something，I would give it to her，and she would do the same for me．I would rather be here at Wuthering Heights with her，even if I'm punished by Joseph and that wicked Hindley，that at Thrushcross Grange with those two fools！’</p>
<p>“不是那么回事儿，艾伦！猜猜我们从他们起居室的窗子望进去时看到了什么？那是一个很漂亮的房间，铺着软软的地毯，四壁洁白。凯瑟琳和我要是有那么一间该多好！但就在这漂亮房间的中间，伊莎贝拉和艾加&middot;林顿正围着一条小狗又吵又闹！他们多傻啊，艾伦！如果凯瑟琳想要什么东西，我就会给她，她对我也一样。就算约瑟夫和那个坏亨德雷惩罚我，我也宁愿跟凯瑟琳在呼啸山庄，而不愿在画眉山庄与那两个傻瓜在一起！”</p>
<p>‘Not so loud，Heathcliff！But you still haven't told me why Catherine isn't with you？’</p>
<p>“小声点儿，希斯克利夫！但你还没告诉我凯瑟琳为什么没和你在一起？”</p>
<p>‘Well，as we were looking in，we started laughing at them so loudly that they heard us，and sent the dogs after us．We were about to run away，when a great fierce dog caught Catherine's leg in its teeth．I attacked it，and made it let go of her leg，but the Lintons' servants appeared and caught hold of me. They must have thought we were robbers．Catherine was carried unconscious into the house，and they pulled me inside too．All the time I was shouting and swearing at them．</p>
<p>“呃，我们往里看的时候开始笑出声来，声音太大被听见了，他们就放狗追我们。就在我们要跑开的当儿，一条凶猛的大狗咬住了凯瑟琳的腿。我打了狗，让它放开她的腿，但林顿家的仆人出来抓住了我。他们肯定是把我们当贼了。凯瑟琳人事不醒，被抬进了房里，他们把我也拽了进去。我一直在不停地大叫大骂他们。</p>
<p>‘“What a wicked pair of thieves！”said old Mr Linton．“The boy must be a gipsy，he's as dark as the devil！”Mrs Linton raised her hands in horror at the sight of me．Catherine opened her eyes，and Edgar looked closely at her．</p>
<p>‘“这两个小恶贼！”老林顿夫人说。“这小子一定是个吉卜赛人，看他黑得像鬼一样！”林顿夫人一看到我，双手惊恐地举了起来。凯瑟琳睁开眼，艾加紧盯着她。</p>
<p>‘“Mother，”he whispered，“the young lady is Miss Earn-shaw，of Wuthering Heights. I've seen her in church occasionally．And look what our dog has done to her leg！It's bleeding badly！”</p>
<p>‘“妈妈，”他低声说，“这小姑娘是呼啸山庄的欧肖小姐。我在教堂碰见过她一两次。看我们的狗把她腿咬的！出了这么多血！”</p>
<p>‘“Miss Earnshaw with a gipsy！”cried Mrs Linton．“Surely not！But I think you must be right，Edgar．This girl is wearing black，and Mr Earnshaw died recently．It must be her．I’d better put a bandage on her leg at once.”</p>
<p>‘“欧肖小姐和一个吉卜赛人在一起！”林顿夫人叫道。“绝对不可能！但我想你说得没错，艾加。欧肖小姐穿黑带孝，欧肖先生是最近刚过世的。一定是她。我得马上把她的腿包扎一下。”</p>
<p>‘“Why does her brother Hindley let her run around with such a companion？”wondered Mr Linton．“I remember now，he's the gipsy child Mr Earnshaw brought home from Liverpool a few years ago.”</p>
<p>‘“她哥哥亨德雷怎么能让她和这么个伴儿到处跑？”林顿先生问。“我想起来了，他是几年前欧肖先生从利物浦带回家的那个吉卜赛孩子。”</p>
<p>‘“He's a wicked boy，you can see that，”said Mrs Linton．“And did you hear the bad language he used just now？I'm shocked that my children heard it.”’</p>
<p>‘“他是个坏小子，你一眼就能看出来，”林顿夫人说。“你没听见刚才他骂的粗话？我的孩子们听到了这些话，真让人害怕。”’</p>
<p>‘I was pushed out into the garden，but I stayed to watch through the window．They put Catherine on a comfortable sofa，cleaned her wound and fed her with cakes and wine．I only left the house when I was sure she was well taken care of．She's a breath of fresh air for those stupid Lintons．I'm not surprised they like her．Everybody who sees her must love her，mustn't they，Ellen？’</p>
<p>“我被推到院子里，但我呆着没走，从窗子往里看。他们把凯瑟琳放到一个舒适的沙发上，为她清洗伤口，喂她蛋糕，给她葡萄酒喝。看到她的确受到善待我才离开他们家。她给林顿家那些笨蛋带去了些新鲜空气。他们对她好，我不奇怪。谁见到她都会喜欢她，你说是吗，艾伦？”</p>
<p>‘I'm afraid you'll be punished for this，Heathcliff，’I said sadly．</p>
<p>“恐怕你会招来惩罚的，希斯克利夫，”我黯然说道。</p>
<p>And I was right．Hindley warned Heathcliff that he must never speak to Catherine again，or he would be sent away from Wuthering Heights，and it was decided that Catherine would be taught to behave like a young lady．</p>
<p>我说的不错。亨德雷警告希斯克利夫再也不许和凯瑟琳说话，要不就把他撵出呼啸山庄，还决定要管教凯瑟琳，让她言谈举止像个年轻淑女的样子。</p>
<p>She stayed with the Linton family at Thrushcross Grange for five weeks，until Christmas．By that time her leg was fine，and her manners were much better than before．Frances Earn-shaw visited her often，bringing her pretty dresses to wear，and persuading her to take care of her appearance，so that when she finally came home after her long absence，she almost seemed a different person．Instead of a wild，hatless girl，we saw a beautiful，carefully dressed young lady．</p>
<p>她在画眉山庄林顿家里住了五个礼拜，直到圣诞节。她腿好了以后，举止比以前规矩多了。弗朗西丝&middot;欧肖常去看她，给她带去漂亮衣服穿，劝说她要注意打扮，所以当久别的凯瑟琳终于回到家时，好像完全变了个人。我们看到的是一个漂漂亮亮、穿戴留意的淑女，不再是那个毛手毛脚、帽子也不戴的小姑娘了。</p>
<p>When she had greeted all of us，she asked for Heathcliff．</p>
<p>跟我们大家打完招呼，她问起希斯克利夫。</p>
<p>‘Come forward，Heathcliff！’called Hindley．‘You may welcome Miss Catherine home，like the other servants．’</p>
<p>“过来，希斯克利夫！”亨德雷叫道。“你可以像其他仆人一样欢迎凯瑟琳小姐回家。”</p>
<p>Heathcliff was used to being outside all day，and had not bothered to wash or change his clothes．His face and hands were black with dirt．In spite of this，Catherine was very glad to see him and rushed up to kiss him．Then she laughed．</p>
<p>希斯克利夫成天在外面呆惯了，也不上心换洗自己的衣服。他的脸和双手黑黑的，沾满尘土。即使这样，凯瑟琳见了他还是很高兴，冲上去吻了他。然后开怀笑了起来。</p>
<p>‘How funny and black and cross you look！But that's because I'm used to Edgar and Isabella，who are always so clean and tidy. Well，Heathcliff，have you forgotten me？’</p>
<p>“你看上去真好笑，那么黑，还闷闷不乐的！但那是因为我看惯了艾加和伊莎贝拉的缘故，他们总是干干净净、整整齐齐的。唉，希斯克利夫，你把我忘了吗？”</p>
<p>But，ashamed and proud，the boy said nothing，until suddenly his feelings were too much for him．</p>
<p>但这孩子既觉得羞愧，又很自尊，什么都没说，直到最后他突然受不了了。</p>
<p>‘I won't stay to be laughed at！’he cried，and was about to run away，when Catherine caught hold of his hand.</p>
<p>“我不在这儿让你们嘲笑我！”他叫道，正准备跑出去，凯瑟琳一把抓住了他。</p>
<p>‘Why are you angry，Heathcliff？You…you just look a bit strange，that's all．You're so dirty！’</p>
<p>“怎么生气啦，希斯克利夫？你……你只不过看上去有点怪怪的，仅此而已。你真脏！”</p>
<p>She looked worriedly at her hands，and her new dress．</p>
<p>她不大放心地看了看自己的手和新衣服。</p>
<p>‘You needn't have touched me！’he said，pulling away his hand．‘I like being dirty，and I'm going to be dirty！’</p>
<p>“你不必来碰我！”他说着，把手抽了回来。“我喜欢脏，以后还是脏！”</p>
<p>As he ran miserably out of the room，Hindley and his wife laughed loudly，delighted that their plan to separate the two young people seemed to be succeeding.</p>
<p>当他窘迫地跑出房间时，亨德雷和他妻子大笑起来，看到拆开这两个年轻人的计划似乎就要得逞，他们很开心。</p>
<p>The next day was Christmas Day．Edgar and Isabella Linton had been invited to lunch，and their mother had agreed，on condition that her darlings were kept carefully apart from‘that wicked boy’．I felt sorry for poor Heathcliff，and while the Earnshaws were at church， I helped him wash and dress in clean clothes．</p>
<p>第二天是圣诞节。已经邀请了艾加和伊莎贝拉&middot;林顿来吃午饭，他们的母亲答应了，条件是要保证她的宝贝儿要离那个“坏小子”远远的。我为可怜的希斯克利夫感到难过，趁欧肖一家去教堂的功夫，我帮他洗换了干净衣裳。</p>
<p>‘You're too proud，’I scolded him as I brushed his black hair．‘You should think how sad Catherine is when you can't be together．And don't be jealous of Edgar Linton！’</p>
<p>“你太要强了，”替他梳那头黑发时我埋怨他。“你应该想想你们不能在一块儿凯瑟琳该多难过埃别去嫉妒艾加&middot;林顿！”</p>
<p>‘I wish I had blue eyes and fair hair like him！I wish I behaved well，and was going to inherit a fortune！’</p>
<p>“我多想自己像他那样长着蓝蓝的眼睛，浅色的头发！我但愿自己能举止得体，将来还可以继承一大笔财产！”</p>
<p>‘He has none of your intelligence or character！And if you have a good heart，you'll have a handsome face. Who knows who your parents were？Perhaps a king and queen，far more important than the Lintons！’</p>
<p>“你的聪明和优点他可一点儿也没有！如果你心地善良，你就会变得英浚谁又知道你父母是什么人物？说不定是国王和王后呢，比林顿家显赫多了！”</p>
<p>In this way I encouraged Heathcliff to have more confidence in himself. But when the Earnshaws and the Lintons arrived back from church，the first thing Hindley did was shout at Heathcliff.</p>
<p>我就是这样鼓励希斯克利夫，让他对自己有更多自信。但当欧肖一家和林顿一家从教堂回来时，亨德雷二话没说就冲着希斯克利夫吼叫起来。</p>
<p>‘Get out of my sight，until we've finished eating！ I'll pull that long hair of yours if you don't obey me at once！’</p>
<p>“我们吃完饭之前别让我看见你！你要是不马上照办我就扯掉你的长头发！”</p>
<p>‘It is long，'said Edgar.‘I'm surprised he can see anything．’</p>
<p>“头发真长，”艾加说。“想不到他还能看见东西。”</p>
<p>This was too much for Heathcliff． He looked desperately around for a weapon，picked up a bowl of hot soup and threw it at Edgar，who started screaming. Hindley immediately took hold of Heathcliff and pushed him upstairs.</p>
<p>希斯克利夫忍无可忍。他孤注一掷地往周围看了看，想找个家伙，接着抄起一盆热汤朝艾加泼了过去。艾加尖叫起来。亨德雷当即抓住希斯克利夫，把他推上了楼。</p>
<p>‘I'm sure Hindley's going to hit him！’cried Catherine.‘I hate it when Heathcliff is punished！ It's your fault， Edgar， you annoyed him！Why did you speak to him？’</p>
<p>“亨德雷肯定是要打他！”凯瑟琳哭道。“我不愿希斯克利夫挨罚！都是你，艾加，你惹怒了他！你为什么要跟他说话？”</p>
<p>‘I didn't，’ replied Edgar，tears in his eyes．‘I promised Mother I wouldn't．I spoke about him， not to him．’</p>
<p>“我没有，”艾加答道，眼里含着泪。“我答应妈妈不跟他讲话。我只是说到他，没对他说话。”</p>
<p>‘Well，don't cry，'said Catherine with scorn．‘You've made enough trouble already. Here comes my brother.’</p>
<p>“哎，别哭了，”凯瑟琳奚落道。“你惹的事儿够多了。我哥来了。”</p>
<p>Hindley returned，hot and breathless．</p>
<p>亨德雷身上燥热、气喘吁吁地回来了。</p>
<p>‘That'll teach him！’he said．‘And now let's have lunch！’</p>
<p>“这下他就会学乖了！”他说。“我们现在吃午饭吧！”</p>
<p>The others seemed to forget Heathcliff，but I noticed Catherine could not eat much，and I knew she was sorry for her friend．In the evening there was music from a travelling band，and dancing in the main room. Catherine said the music sounded sweeter from high up，and so she went to sit in the dark on the stairs．When I went to find her，however，I discovered she had gone right to the top of the house to talk to Heathcliff through his locked bedroom door，and had then climbed out on to the roof and in through his window．I persuaded them both to come out of the room the same way， as I had no key to the door，and took Heathcliff down into the warm servants’kitchen with me，while Catherine returned to her guests and the dancing．</p>
<p>其他人好像把希斯克利夫抛到了脑后，但我看出凯瑟琳吃不下东西，我知道她是为她的朋友感到难过。那天晚上有一个巡回乐队来演奏音乐，在正屋里跳起了舞。凯瑟琳说音乐从高处听更柔美，就去坐到了黑黑的楼梯上。但我去找她时，发现她已经直接跑到房子的顶层，隔着上了锁的门跟希斯克利夫说话。然后她又爬到房顶上，从他的窗户钻了进去。我劝说他们俩照原样从房间里出来，因为我没有那扇门的钥匙。我把希斯克利夫领到下面仆人的厨房，那儿暧和，而凯瑟琳则回到客人们中间跳舞去了。</p>
<p>‘You must be hungry，Heathcliff，’I said.‘You haven't eaten all day. Have some Christmas cake，do.’</p>
<p>“你一定饿了，希斯克利夫，”我说。“你一整天没吃东西了。吃些圣诞蛋糕吧，吃吧。”</p>
<p>‘I can't eat anything，’he growled，putting his head in his hands．‘I've got to think how I can have my revenge on Hindley．I only hope he doesn't die first！He'll be sorry he's treated me like this，Ellen！’</p>
<p>“我什么也吃不下，”他吼道，把头埋在双手里。“我要想个法子报复亨德雷。我只盼着他别先死了！他这样对我会后悔的，艾伦！”</p><a href='5.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
