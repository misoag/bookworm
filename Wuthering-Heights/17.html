<p><b>17 洛克伍德先生再访呼啸山庄 </b></p>
<p>1802 After hearing the end of Mrs Dean's story，I made my plans for the future．I decided I did not want to spend another winter at the Grange，and told her I would ride to the Heights to inform my landlord．She handed me a letter to give to Cathy Heathcliff．</p>
<p>1802年。听完了迪恩夫人的故事，我为自己的将来做好了计划。我拿定主意不想在画眉山庄过第二个冬天了，我告诉她我要骑马到呼啸山庄去通知我的房东。她交给我一封信要我带给凯茜&middot;希斯克利夫。</p>
<p>When I arrived at the gate，Hareton met me and took me into the house．Cathy was there，preparing vegetables for lunch．She did not bother to greet me．</p>
<p>我到大门口时，哈里顿迎我进了房子。凯茜在，正准备午餐用的蔬菜。她懒得和我打招呼。</p>
<p>‘She may be beautiful，’I thought，‘but she's not very polite．’I passed by her chair，and cleverly dropped Mrs Dean's note in front of her，so that Hareton wouldn't see it．She，however，just said aloud，‘What's that？’</p>
<p>“她也许漂亮，”我想，“可她太无礼了。”走过她的椅子时我巧妙地把迪恩夫人的便条丢在她面前，这样哈里顿就看不见了。可她却大声说道，“那是什么？”</p>
<p>‘A letter from the housekeeper at the Grange，’I said，annoyed with her．She gasped，and tried to pick it up，but Hareton got there first．</p>
<p>“画眉山庄女管家的信，”我说，有些生她的气。她愣了一下，刚想要拣起来，但哈里顿先拿到了。</p>
<p>‘Mr Heathcliff will want to look at this，’he said，putting it in his pocket．But when Cathy pretended to cry，Hareton could not bear to make her sad，and he threw the letter down on the table．She eagerly read every word，and asked me several questions about the people at the Grange．</p>
<p>“希斯克利夫先生会想看看的，”他说，把信揣进了口袋里。可当凯茜假装哭的时候，哈里顿不忍让她伤心，把信扔到桌子上。她急切地读着每一个字，还问了我几个关于画眉山庄里的人的问题。</p>
<p>‘Mrs Dean will want an answer to her letter，’I reminded her．</p>
<p>“迪恩夫人想有回信，”我提醒她。</p>
<p>‘You must tell her that I have no paper or pens to write with．I haven't even any books！'she answered sadly．</p>
<p>“你一定要告诉她我没有可用来写信的纸和笔。我连书都没有！”她难过地说。</p>
<p>‘No books！’I cried．‘How can you manage without them in this lonely place？’</p>
<p>“没有书！”我叫道。“在这么孤寂的地方没有书你是怎么过的？”</p>
<p>‘I always used to read so much that Mr Heathcliff decided to take away my only pleasure and destroy my books．I've looked all over the house for them．Joseph only reads the Bible，but some of my books are in Hareton's room！Why did you take them，Hareton？Just because you enjoy stealing？They can't be any use to you！’</p>
<p>“我过去总是很喜欢读书，所以希斯克利夫先生决定剥夺我唯一的乐趣，把我的书毁掉。我整个屋子都找遍了。约瑟夫只读《圣经》，可我的一些书却在哈里顿的房间里！你为什么要拿那些书，哈里顿？只是因为你喜欢偷东西吗？它们对你没什么用！”</p>
<p>‘I think Mr Hareton wants to learn，’I said，hoping to prevent a quarrel between them．‘No doubt he took them away to study them．’</p>
<p>“我想哈里顿先生是想学习，”我说，希望他们别吵起来。“无疑他拿走书是去研读的。”</p>
<p>‘Yes，'replied Cathy，laughing．‘I hear him trying to read to himself sometimes and it's extremely funny！He makes some terrible mistakes！’</p>
<p>“是的，”凯茜笑着答道。“我听到他有时自己试着读书，可笑极了！有时犯严重的错误。”</p>
<p>After a moment's shocked silence Hareton left the room．He returned almost immediately with his arms full of books，and threw them angrily down at Cathy's feet．</p>
<p>哈里顿很吃惊，呆呆地说不出话来，过了一会儿离开了房间。他随后即抱着一怀抱书回来，怒气冲冲地将书扔在凯茜的脚边。</p>
<p>‘Take them！’he shouted．‘I never want to see them again！’</p>
<p>“拿走吧！”他嚷道。“我再也不想看了！”</p>
<p>‘I won't have them now，'she said．‘I'll hate them because they'll make me think of you．’</p>
<p>“我现在也不想要它们了。”她说。“我会恨它们的，因为会让我想起你。”</p>
<p>Hareton picked up the books and threw them on the fire，then walked quickly out of the house．</p>
<p>哈里顿拣起书扔进了火里，然后快步走出了房子。</p>
<p>Mr Heathcliff came in as Hareton went out．He had a restless，anxious expression on his face．</p>
<p>哈里顿一出去希斯克利夫先生就进来了。满脸焦虑不安的表情。</p>
<p>‘Mr Heathcliff，’I said，‘I must tell you I'm leaving for London next week，for six months，and I shan't want to rent the Grange any more after October．’</p>
<p>“希斯克利夫先生，”我说，“我得告诉您我下周要去伦敦，要走六个月，所以10月份以后我就不想再租用画眉山庄了。”</p>
<p>‘So，Mr Lockwood，you've got tired of the moors already，have you？Well，have your lunch with Hareton and me，anyway．Cathy，take your lunch in the kitchen with Joseph and Zillah．’</p>
<p>“这么说，洛克伍德先生，您已经厌倦荒原了，是吗？好，不管怎么样，您跟哈里顿和我一起用午餐吧。凯茜，你在厨房同约瑟夫和齐拉吃午餐。”</p>
<p>I did not enjoy lunch with my two silent companions，and left the Heights straight afterwards．</p>
<p>跟两位默不作声的人一起用午餐真不是件乐事，之后我就直接离开了呼啸山庄。</p>
<p>‘What a pity，’I thought，‘that Cathy Heathcliff and I didn't fall in love，as Mrs Dean would have liked！Then I could have taken her away from this miserable place for ever！’</p>
<p>“真遗憾，”我想，“凯茜&middot;希斯克利夫和我没有像迪恩夫人希望的那样彼此相爱！果真如此的话我就带她永远离开这个伤心的地方。”</p>
<p>Several months later，in September，I was travelling to visit friends in Yorkshire．I found myself near Thrushcross Grange，and decided to spend a night there．After all，I was still paying rent for it．When I arrived，I was surprised to find a different housekeeper，who told me Mrs Dean had become housekeeper at the Heights．I wanted to have a walk after travelling all day，so I left orders for the woman to cook my supper and prepare bedroom for me，and I walked the four miles to Wuthering Heights．</p>
<p>几个月之后，正值9月，我去看望在约克郡的朋友，途中我发现自己离画眉山庄不远，于是决定去那儿过一夜。没想到到了那儿却发现管家已换了个人，新的管家告诉我迪恩夫人已到呼啸山庄去做管家了。经过一整天的旅行我想散散步，于是吩咐女管家为我做好晚餐，准备一间卧室，然后我步行四英里去呼啸山庄。</p>
<p>As I came close to the old house，I noticed that there were flowers in the garden，and the doors and windows stood open．I could see two people inside，and I stopped for a moment，curious to hear a little of their conversation．</p>
<p>当我走近那栋老宅子，我注意到花园里开着花，门和窗也都是开着的。我能看见里面有两个人，我驻足站了一会儿，好奇地听到他们之间的一点谈话。</p>
<p>‘Read it again，stupid！'said a voice as sweet as a silver bell．‘Read it correctly this time，or I'll pull your hair！’</p>
<p>“再读一遍，笨蛋！”一个银铃般甜美的声音说道。“这次别读错了，否则我就拽你的头发！”</p>
<p>‘You must kiss me if I get it right，’answered a deep voice．The man was sitting at a table，reading from a book．His handsome face shone with pleasure，and his eyes often left the book to look at the small white hand that lay on his shoulder．The girl stood behind him，bending over to help him．Her face—it was fortunate he could not see her face，or he would never have been able to concentrate on his studies．I could see it，and I was bitterly sorry that I had thrown away my chance of seeing that beauty every day of my life．</p>
<p>“我要是读对了你一定要吻我，”一个低沉的声音回答。这个人坐在桌旁，正读一本书。他英俊的面庞洋溢着喜悦的光彩，他的双眼不时离开书本看着搭在他肩上的白皙的小手。那姑娘站在他身后，弯着腰辅导他。她的面庞——幸亏他看不到她的面庞，否则他决不能集中精神学习。可我能看到这面庞，我真是懊悔自己丢掉了此生终日与这个美人相见的机会。</p>
<p>I did not want to disturb their happiness，so I went round to the back door，where I discovered my old friend Ellen Dean．</p>
<p>我不想打搅他们的快乐，所以绕到了后门，在那儿看到了我的老朋友艾伦&middot;迪恩。</p>
<p>‘Oh，Mr Lockwood，welcome back！'she cried．‘Are you staying at the Grange again？’</p>
<p>“噢，洛克伍德先生，欢迎回来！”她叫道。“您又在画眉山庄住了？”</p>
<p>‘Yes，Mrs Dean，just for one night．But tell me，why are you housekeeper here now and not at the Grange？’</p>
<p>“是的，迪恩夫人，只住一夜。先告诉我，你为什么在这儿做管家而不在画眉山庄了？”</p>
<p>‘Zillah left，you see，and Mr Heathcliff wanted me here．’</p>
<p>“齐拉走了，你知道，希斯克利夫先生想要我到这儿来。”</p>
<p>‘I have a little business with him，about the rent．’</p>
<p>“我和他还有一些事务，租房子的事。”</p>
<p>‘Oh！Mr Heathcliff is dead，sir．He died three months ago．I manage all Mrs Heathcliff's business for her．She hasn't learnt to do it herself yet，you see．’</p>
<p>“噢！希斯克利夫先生死了，先生。他三个月以前死的。我替希斯克利夫夫人处理一切事务。她还没学会自己来干，你知道。”</p>
<p>‘Heathcliff is dead！’I repeated，surprised．‘Well！Tell me how it happened，Mrs Dean！’</p>
<p>“希斯克利夫死了！”我惊异地重复道。“那么，告诉我是怎么回事，迪恩夫人！”</p>
<p>‘Sit down，sir，and drink some beer．I'll gladly tell you．His life ended very strangely．’</p>
<p>“请坐，先生，喝点啤酒。我很乐意告诉您。他的生命结束得很奇特。”</p><a href='18.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
