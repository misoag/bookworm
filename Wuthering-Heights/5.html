<p><b>5 凯瑟琳与艾加 </b></p>
<p>1778 In the summer of this year Hindley's wife Frances had her first，and last，baby．They called the boy Hareton．But the poor woman had been ill for a long time， although we had not realized it，and died soon after Hareton was born．</p>
<p>1778年。这年夏天，亨德雷的妻子弗朗西丝生下她的第一个，也是最后一个孩子。他们给这个男孩起名叫哈里顿。尽管我们没有意识到，其实那个可怜的女人已是病了不短时间，在生下哈里顿后不久就死了。</p>
<p>Hindley only had room in his heart for two people，himself and his wife，so when she died，he was in despair. He neither cried nor prayed. Instead he swore at God and man，and drank himself to sleep every night．The servants all left him，except for Joseph and me．Joseph enjoyed being able to scold his wicked employer，with warnings from the Bible，and I could not leave Miss Catherine. After all，I had grown up with her and Hindley.</p>
<p>亨德雷的心里只容得下两个人，他和他妻子，她这么一死，亨德雷万念俱灰。他既没哭，也没祈祷。反而怨天尤人，一天到晚地喝酒。仆人们都离开了他，只剩下约瑟夫和我。约瑟夫很高兴能有机会引用《圣经》中的警句来斥责他那恶毒的主人几句，我也离不开凯瑟琳。不管怎么说，我是与她和亨德雷一块儿长大的。</p>
<p>But the master's behaviour was a bad example for Catherine and Heathcliff.At fifteen，Catherine was the most beautiful girl for miles around，but she was proud and quick－tempered. She led what was almost a double life. At Wuthering Heights，under Heathcliff's influence，she annoyed Hindley，laughed at Joseph，and was rude to me．But at Thrushcross Grange，which she often visited，she showed a different，calmer side of her character，and was polite，intelligent and amusing. The Lintons all liked her，and poor Edgar had fallen in love with her.</p>
<p>但主人的所作所为对凯瑟琳和希斯克利夫起了坏影响。凯瑟琳15岁时，出落成方圆数英里最漂亮的姑娘，但她傲气十足，性情暴躁。她几乎是过着一种双重生活。在呼啸山庄，受希斯克利夫的影响，她惹亨德雷生气，拿约瑟夫取笑，对我也无礼。但在她常去的画眉山庄，就表现出她性格中恬静的另一面，她彬彬有礼，聪明风趣。林顿一家都喜欢她，可怜的艾加已经爱上了她。</p>
<p>Heathcliff was sixteen at this time. He did not have time to study any more，and the long hours of work on the farm made him tired and dull. There was always an angry expression on his face，and he did not even try to keep himself clean and tidy．He seemed to want people to dislike him．Catherine and he still spent time together，when he was not working in the fields，but he no longer expressed his fondness for her in words，and he looked angry if she touched or kissed him．</p>
<p>希斯克利夫当时16岁。他再也没有时间去学习，终日在农庄里长时间劳作使他身心疲惫、无精打采。他的脸上总是有一种愤愤然的表情，也不上心保持自己的整洁。他好像是想让人讨厌他。他不下地干活儿时，凯瑟琳还时常和他呆在一起，但他不再开口表达对她的深情，凯瑟琳碰他或吻他时，他甚至看上去很恼怒。</p>
<p>One afternoon，when Hindley had gone into town，Heath－ cliff came into the main room after lunch. I was helping Catherine to arrange her hair，as she had invited Edgar Linton to visit her while Hindley was absent．</p>
<p>一天下午，亨德雷进城去了，希斯克利夫吃完午饭后进了正屋。我正在帮凯瑟琳梳理头发，因为她请了艾加&middot;林顿在亨德雷不在家的时候来看她。</p>
<p>‘Catherine，are you going anywhere this afternoon？’asked Heathcliff．‘Why have you got that silk dress on？Nobody's visiting you，I hope．’</p>
<p>“凯瑟琳，你下午要去哪儿吗？”希斯克利夫问道。“为什么穿上了丝绸礼服？我希望不是有人要来看你吧。”</p>
<p>‘No-o，I don't think so，'replied Catherine，looking quickly at me．‘But you should be at work by now，Heathcliff．’</p>
<p>“没，没有，我没这么想，”凯瑟琳回答，说着瞥了我一眼。“但你现在应该上工了，希斯克利夫。”</p>
<p>‘That devil Hindley isn't away very often．I'm taking a holiday．I won't work any more today． I'm staying with you this afternoon．He'll never know．’</p>
<p>“亨德雷那恶棍不常出去。我今天休假。我今天不干活儿了，我今天下午和你在一起。他不会知道的。”</p>
<p>Catherine thought for a moment. Somehow she had to prepare him for Edgar's visit ‘Isabella and Edgar said they might call here this afternoon．If they come，you'll be scolded for not working．’</p>
<p>凯瑟琳寻思了一会儿。她反正要让他对艾加的造访有个准备。“伊莎贝拉和艾加说今天下午要来这儿。如果他们来了，你不干活儿会受责骂的。”</p>
<p>‘Tell Ellen to say you're busy and can't see them，’he said．‘Those friends of yours take up all your time．You spend most of your evenings with them，not with me．’</p>
<p>“告诉艾伦说你没空儿，不能见他们，”他说。“你的这帮朋友占用了你全部时间，你多数晚上都和他们在一起，没和我。”</p>
<p>‘Well，why should I always spend my time with you？'she asked crossly．‘What can you talk about？How can you amuse me？’</p>
<p>“那，为什么我要总和你在一起呢？”她愠怒地问道。“我们能谈些什么？你能怎样逗我开心？”</p>
<p>‘You never told me before that you didn't like my company，Catherine！’cried Heathcliff．</p>
<p>“你以前从没告诉我你不喜欢和我在一起，凯瑟琳！”希斯克利夫大声道。</p>
<p>Just then we heard a horse outside， and there was a light knock on the door．Edgar Linton entered，his handsome face full of delight at receiving Catherine's unexpected invitation． I wondered if Catherine was comparing her two friends， as Edgar came in and Heathcliff ran out．</p>
<p>就在此时我们听到外面传来马声，然后是轻轻的敲门声。艾加&middot;林顿走进来，出乎意料地受到凯瑟琳的邀请，他那英俊的脸上满面春风。我搞不清凯瑟琳是不是在对她的两个朋友做比较，艾加进来时，希斯克利夫跑了出去。</p>
<p>‘I haven't come too soon，have I？’asked Edgar politely．</p>
<p>“我没来得太早吧，是么？”艾加彬彬有礼地问。</p>
<p>‘No，’answered Catherine．‘Leave us alone，Ellen．’</p>
<p>“没有，”凯瑟琳回答。“别管我们了，艾伦。”</p>
<p>‘I'm just doing my work，miss，’I replied，pretending to dust the furniture．Hindley had told me to be present if Edgar Linton came to visit Catherine．</p>
<p>“我还在干活儿呢，小姐，”我回答，假装掸家具上的灰尘。亨德雷吩咐我如果艾加&middot;林顿来看凯瑟琳，我要在常</p>
<p>She came up to me，and whispered crossly，‘Go away，Ellen！’Keeping her back to Edgar，she cruelly scratched my arm．</p>
<p>她朝我走过来，懊恼地小声说，“走吧，艾伦！”她背对着艾加，恶狠狠地抓着我的胳膊。</p>
<p>‘Oh！’ I screamed，to show Edgar what had happened．‘What a wicked thing to do，miss！You have no right to hurt me！’</p>
<p>“噢！”我尖叫起来，要让艾加看看到底是怎么回事。“这么做太恶毒了，小姐！你没权伤害我！”</p>
<p>‘I didn't touch you，you lying creature！'she cried angrily，and，unable to control herself，hit me hard on the face．</p>
<p>“我没动你，你这个嚼舌头的东西！”她恼怒地喊道，失去了自控，重重地打在我的脸上。</p>
<p>‘Catherine，love！Catherine！’cried Edgar，shocked．</p>
<p>“凯瑟琳，亲爱的！凯瑟琳！”艾加叫道，大吃一惊。</p>
<p>The baby，Hareton，who followed me everywhere，immediately started sobbing and saying，‘Wicked aunt Catherine！’</p>
<p>哈里顿那孩子一向是我去哪儿他去哪儿，他马上开始哭出声来，叫着，“坏姑姑凯瑟琳！”</p>
<p>She picked him up and shook the poor child until he screamed．Edgar rushed up to her and tried to stop her．At once she turned and hit him over the ear as hard as she could．</p>
<p>她提起他，摇着这惨兮兮的孩子，直到他尖叫起来。艾加冲上去想制止她。她当即转过身，用尽全身力气打在他的耳部。</p>
<p>The young man looked very pale and went straight to the door．</p>
<p>这年轻人面色惨白，直奔门而去。</p>
<p>‘Where are you going，Edgar Linton？'she asked．‘Don't leave me！I shall be miserable all night！’</p>
<p>“你去哪儿，艾加&middot;林顿？”她问道。“别离开我！我整夜都会难受的！”</p>
<p>‘Can I stay after you have hit me？’he replied．‘You've made me afraid and ashamed of you．I won't come here again！’</p>
<p>“你打了我，我还能呆下去么？”他回答。“你让我怕了你，为你感到羞耻。我不会再来了！”</p>
<p>‘Well，go then，if you want to！'she cried．‘I'm going to cry until I'm ill！’and she dropped on to the floor，her shoulders shaking and the tears rolling down her face． Edgar managed to get as far as the door．But here he hesitated，and I called out to him to encourage him to leave．</p>
<p>“好，走罢，随你便！”她哭喊道。“我要哭出病来！”说着倒在地板上，肩膀战栗着，眼泪顺着脸庞淌下来。艾加已走到门口。但在那儿犹豫着，我向他喊着，催他离开。</p>
<p>‘Miss is just a selfish child，sir！You’d better ride home and forget her！’</p>
<p>“小姐只是个自私的孩子，先生！你最好骑马回家，忘了她吧！”</p>
<p>But as he could not stop looking at her，I knew there was no hopeKfor him．Nothing would keep him away from her now．And sure enough，he came back into the room and shut the door．This time I left them alone，and stayed in the kitchen with little Hareton，but when I came to warn them that Hindley had returned，I realized that their quarrel had only brought them closer together．</p>
<p>但他忍不住看着她，我就知道他没指望了。现在什么都没法使他离开她。自然而然，他回到房里关上门。这次我不管他们了，到厨房和小哈里顿呆着，但当我去提醒他们亨德雷回来了时，我看得出他们这一吵不过是让他们走得更近了。</p><a href='6.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
