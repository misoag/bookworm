<p><b>8 凯瑟琳病了 </b></p>
<p>1783 The next time Heathcliff came to Thrushcross Grange，he met Isabella by chance in front of the house．I was watching from the kitchen window，as he went up to her，and，supposing that no one else could see him，kissed her．</p>
<p>1783年。希斯克利夫再次来画眉山庄时碰巧在宅子前面见到了伊莎贝拉。他朝她走过去的时候，我正从厨房的窗户里看着，他以为没人能看见他，就吻了她。</p>
<p>‘Look，madam！’I cried to Catherine，who was passing through the kitchen．‘That devil Heathcliff told you he could never love Miss Isabella！And now he's kissing her！’</p>
<p>“看哪，夫人！”我喊着凯瑟琳，她正从厨房走过。“希斯克利夫那恶棍告诉你他决不会爱伊莎贝拉小姐！这会儿正吻她呢！”</p>
<p>Sohwhen Heathcliff entered the house，Catherine was ready to scold him．</p>
<p>所以希斯克利夫一进房子，凯瑟琳已经打定主意责备他了。</p>
<p>‘Leave Isabella alone，Heathcliff！'she ordered．‘You'll make Edgar angry！’</p>
<p>“别碰伊莎贝拉，希斯克利夫！”她用命令的口吻说道。“你会惹怒艾加的！”</p>
<p>‘You think I'm afraid of that weak little creature？’he growled．‘Anyway，what difference does it make to you？I can kiss her if she likes it．I'm not your husband，you needn't be jealous of me！’</p>
<p>“你以为我怕那个弱不禁风的小东西？”他吼叫道。“再说，这跟你有什么关系？只要她愿意，我就可以吻她。我不是你的丈夫，你不必嫉妒我！”</p>
<p>‘I'm not jealous of you！'replied Catherine．‘If you like Isabella，you can marry her．But do you like her？’</p>
<p>“我没嫉妒你！”凯瑟琳回答。“如果你喜欢伊莎贝拉，你可以娶她。可你真的喜欢她吗？”</p>
<p>‘It's you I want to talk about，Catherine．You know you've treated me badly．And I'm going to have my revenge！Thank you for telling me Isabella's secret．I swear I'll make good use of it！’</p>
<p>“我想谈论的是你，凯瑟琳。你明白你们都怎么虐待我。我要报复！谢谢你告诉我伊莎贝拉的秘密。我立誓要好好利用这一点！”</p>
<p>At this point I went to look for my master，and told him that Catherine and Heathcliff were quarrelling in the kitchen．</p>
<p>到了这地步我就去找了我的主人，告诉他凯瑟琳和希斯克利夫正在厨房里争吵。</p>
<p>‘How can my wife call that man a friend？’he cried angrily．‘I've been too weak with her．I can't allow him to visit her any more．Call two servants，Ellen．’He went to the kitchen．I followed him，telling the servants to wait in the hall．</p>
<p>“我妻子怎么会称这个人为朋友？”他怒吼道。“我对她一直太纵容了。我不能允许他再来看她。叫两个仆人，艾伦。”他朝厨房而去。我跟着他，叫仆人在厅里等着。</p>
<p>‘Catherine！'said Mr Edgar to his wife as he entered．‘Do you think it's right to listen to this wicked man's talk？’</p>
<p>“凯瑟琳！”艾加先生一进门便对妻子说道。“你觉得听这恶棍说话合适吗？”</p>
<p>‘Have you been listening at the door，Edgar？’asked Catherine coldly．Heathcliff laughed，which made Mr Edgar even angrier．</p>
<p>“你在门口听着的吗，艾加？”凯瑟琳冷冷地问道。希斯克利夫笑了起来，艾加先生火气更大了。</p>
<p>‘You，sir’，he said to Heathcliff，‘are poisoning our family life．I should never have accepted you as Catherine's friend．I must inform you that you will never be allowed to enter this house again，and that if you don't leave within three minutes，you will be thrown out．’</p>
<p>“你，先生，”他对希斯克利夫说，“在破坏我的家庭生活。我本来就不应该把你当凯瑟琳的朋友看待。我必须奉告你决不许你再进这房子，如果你三分钟内不离开，你就会被扔出去。”</p>
<p>‘Well，well！'replied Heathcliff，looking scornfully at Mr Edgar's small figure．．‘So，you're going to throw me out your self，are you？’</p>
<p>“好，好！”希斯克利夫回答，满脸讥讽地看着艾加先生瘦小的身躯。“这么说，你要亲自把我扔出去喽，是吗？”</p>
<p>My master looked towards the door．I realized he wanted to call the servants，as he knew he was not strong enough to fight Heathcliff alone．But Catherine must have guessed his plan．She hurried to the door and locked it．Mr Edgar looked at her in angry surprise．</p>
<p>我的主人往门那儿看了一眼。我意识到他想叫仆人，因为他明白他自个儿无力与希斯克利夫斗。但凯瑟琳想必猜出了他的心思。她赶到门前，锁上了门。艾加先生又气又惊地盯着她。</p>
<p>‘You must fight him like a gentleman，without anyone to help you！'she told her husband．‘That'll teach you to scold me！’</p>
<p>“你必须像个绅士一样跟他打，别叫人帮忙！”她告诉丈夫。“对你责骂我会是个教训！”</p>
<p>Mr Edgar tried to get hold of the key，but she threw it quickly into the hottest part of the fire．He went very pale，and could not stop his whole body trembling．</p>
<p>艾加先生试图去抢钥匙，可她当即把钥匙扔进炉火的中央。他的脸色变得煞白，无法控制全身的颤抖。</p>
<p>‘Oh Edgar！’cried his wife．‘You've lost the fight already！You aren't a man，you're a mouse！’</p>
<p>“噢艾加！”他妻子叫道。“你已经输了！你不是个男人，你是只老鼠！”</p>
<p>‘So that，'said Heathcliff，pointing at MrLEdgar，‘is the thing you preferred to me，Catherine．Is he crying，or is he goingIto die of fear？’</p>
<p>“你就喜欢这么个东西，”希斯克利夫指着艾加先生说，“而不喜欢我，凯瑟琳。他是要哭出来，还是会吓死？”</p>
<p>He went up to look more closely at Mr Edgar，who suddenly recovered and hit Heathcliff hard on the neck．While Heath cliff was getting his breath back，Mr Edgar walked out of the other kitchen door into the garden．</p>
<p>他凑上前去更接近地看着艾加先生，艾加先生冷不防地缓过劲来重重打在希斯克利夫的脖子上。趁希斯克利夫正往回喘气的当儿，艾加先生从厨房的旁门走出去，到了花园。</p>
<p>‘Now you'll never be able to come here again，'said Cather ine to Heathcliff．‘Go away quickly！He'll return with men and guns．’</p>
<p>“哎，你再也不能来这儿了，”凯瑟琳对希斯克利夫说。“快走罢！他就要带着人、带着枪来了。”</p>
<p>Heathcliff was sensible enough to take her advice．He broke down the locked door and escaped，just as the master and his men returned．</p>
<p>希斯克利夫明智地听从了她的劝告。就在主人和他的手下回来的当儿，他砸坏锁着的门逃走了。</p>
<p>Catherine，who was over-excited，ordered me to go upstairs with her．I hoped she would not discover that I had told Mr Edgar about her quarrel with Heathcliff．</p>
<p>凯瑟琳十分激动，吩咐我陪她上楼。我希望她别发现我告诉艾加先生她和希斯克利夫吵架的事。</p>
<p>‘I'm wild with anger，Ellen！'she said，when we reached the sittingroom．‘All this trouble is because of Isabella！Tell Edgar I'm in danger ofhbecoming seriously ill．I hope it's true，I want to frighten him．He's upset me badly．Why did he lis ten to us talking in the kitchen？Heathcliff says wicked things，but I know I can control him．Well，if I can't have Heathcliff as my friend，if Edgar is going to be mean and jealous，I'll try to break both their hearts by breaking my own．You must re mind Edgar how quick-tempered I am，and What Dr Kenneth said about my health．Edgar must let me do what I want！’</p>
<p>“我气疯了，艾伦！”我们刚进起居室她就说，“麻烦都是伊莎贝拉惹起的！跟艾加说我快病得不行了。我盼着真生病，我想吓唬吓唬他。他让我狼狈坏了。他为什么要偷听我们在厨房的谈话？希斯克利夫说了些难听的，可我有把握能控制他。好，如果我不能有希斯克利夫这个朋友，要是艾加开始小器、嫉妒，我就让自己伤心来使他们俩都心碎。你千万要提醒艾加我脾气如果暴躁，肯尼士大夫是怎么说我的健康情况的。艾加得让我做我想做的事！”</p>
<p>I did not feel sympathetic towards Catherine，and certainly did not want to frighten my poor master by telling him she was ill．As I was leaving the room，however，he entered．</p>
<p>我对凯瑟琳不感觉同情，当然也不想去吓唬我那悲惨的主人，告诉他她病了。但我正要离开房间的时候，他进来了。</p>
<p>‘Catherine，’he said，‘you must tell me one thing．You must choose between me and Heathcliff．Which do you intend to have？’</p>
<p>“凯瑟琳，”他说，“你必须给我说清楚一件事，你必须在我和希斯克利夫之间做出选择。你想要哪一个？”</p>
<p>‘Leave me alone！'she cried wildly．‘I'm ill，can't you see，I can't even stand！Edgar，leave me！’</p>
<p>“别烦我！”她狂怒地喊道。“我病了，你看不见吗，我站都站不住了！艾加，别烦我！”</p>
<p>She fell，stiff and pale，on to the floor．Mr Edgar looked very frightened．</p>
<p>她脸色煞白，直挺挺地倒在地板上。艾加先生惊恐万分。</p>
<p>‘Don't worry，sir，’I whispered to him．‘She told me she would try to make you afraid by pretending to be ill．’</p>
<p>“别担心，先生，”我轻声对他说。“她告诉我她要装病来吓唬您。”</p>
<p>Unfortunately she heard me．She jumped up，her hair loose and her eyes staring，and rushed to her bedroom．We heard the key turn in the lock．</p>
<p>不巧被她听见。她跳起来，披头散发、双目圆瞪，跑向她的卧室。我们听到锁被拧上了。</p>
<p>For the next few days she refused to speak to anyone，even me．I took her food up to her room，but she would not eat．Mr Edgar spent his time in the library，and did not ask about his wife．He hoped，I suppose，that she would come and ask him to forgive her．But I knew she was too proud to do that．</p>
<p>此后好几天她对谁都一言不发，连我在内。我把饭端到她房间，可她不肯吃。艾加先生呆在书房，也不过问他妻子。我想，他是指望她会来请求他原谅。但我清楚她那么傲慢，是不会那样做的。</p>
<p>On the third day she unlocked her door and called me．She ate and drank eagerly，then lay down again．</p>
<p>到第三天她打开房门把我叫去。她狼吞虎咽地又吃又喝，接着又躺倒了。</p>
<p>‘Oh，why don't I die，since no one cares about me！'she muttered．‘Edgar doesn't love me at all！What is he doing all this time，Ellen？’</p>
<p>“噢，我怎么不死，反正没人关心我！”她咕哝道。“艾加根本就不爱我！这段时间他在干吗，艾伦？”</p>
<p>‘He's reading Mbooks in the library，madam，’I answered．</p>
<p>“他在书房看书，夫人，”我回答。</p>
<p>‘Reading books！'she cried，shocked．‘And I'm dying up here！My God！Does he know how I've changed，how ill I am？Can't you tell him I'm seriously ill，Ellen？’</p>
<p>“看书！”她惊异地嚷道。“我在上面都快死了！上帝！他知道我变化有多大，病得有多重吗？你就不能告诉他我病得不行了，艾伦？”</p>
<p>‘You forget，Mrs Linton，that you've eaten tonight．I'm sure you'll feel better tomorrow morning．’I still wanted to make her realize how selfish she was being，although I was a little worried by her pale，almost ghostly face．</p>
<p>“您忘了，林顿夫人，您今晚吃了东西。我肯定您明天早上会感觉好些的。”我还是希望能使她认识到她有多自私，尽管她苍白、如幽灵般的脸色令我有点儿担心。</p>
<p>‘I begin to see that you don't like me，Ellen．How strange！I always thought everybody loved me！Now they are all my enemies—Isabella and Edgar and you！I'll die with cold faces around me！I've had terrible dreams these past few nights，you know．Open the window，Ellen！I'm so hot！’</p>
<p>“我开始觉察到你不喜欢我了，艾伦。真想不到！我总以为人人都喜欢我！而如今他们都成了我的对头——伊莎贝拉和艾加，还有你！周围都是冷冰冰的面孔，我要死了！前几个晚上我一直在做恶梦，你清楚。打开窗户，艾伦！我太热啦！”</p>
<p>I refused，as it was the middle of winter．She was feverish．</p>
<p>因为正值隆冬，我不肯。她有点发烧。</p>
<p>‘Who is that over there？'she asked，staring at her own face in a mirror opposite her bed．I could not make her under stand it was herself，and I began to be afraid that her illness was real．</p>
<p>“那是谁？”她盯着床对面镜子中她自己的脸问道。我无法使她明白那就是她自己，所以我开始担心她是真病了。</p>
<p>‘Stay with me，Ellen，'she cried，holding my hand．‘I'm frightened of that face！I'm frightened of being alone！I wish I were in my bed at Wuthering Heights，with the wind howling through the trees．Do let me feel a breath of air from the moors，just one breath！’</p>
<p>“陪着我，艾伦，”她抓着我的手叫道。“那张脸让我害怕！我害怕一个人呆着！我希望我是躺在呼啸山庄我的床上，风在树林间呼啸。就让我感受一下荒原上吹来的空气吧，就一下！”</p>
<p>I opened the window for a moment，then closed it．The cold air seemed to calm her．‘I wish I were a young girl again，wild and free，out on the moors with Heathcliff！Open the window again，wider this time！Why won't you？’</p>
<p>我把窗打开了一会儿，接着又关上。冰冷的空气似乎使她安静了些。“我希望我又成了小姑娘，疯疯癫癫、自由自在，同希斯克利夫一起到荒原去！再把窗子打开，这次开大点！你为什么不肯？”</p>
<p>‘Because I don't want you to die of cold，’I replied．</p>
<p>“因为我不想你冻死，”我回答。</p>
<p>‘But it's my only chance of life！'she cried，jumping out of bed and going to the window．I tried to force her back to bed，but her fever made her surprisingly strong．We looked out together into the icy darkness．There was no moon，and no lights were visible anywhere．But Catherine was sure she could see Wuthering Heights．</p>
<p>“可只有这样我才有活下去的可能！”她叫着，从床上跳下来奔窗户而去。我试图拉她回床上去，可她高度兴奋，力气大得出奇。我们一起望着外面旱冰般的黑暗。没有月亮，也看不见灯光。但凯瑟琳一口咬定她能看到呼啸山庄。</p>
<p>‘Look！'she said．‘There's my old home，and the church yard near it．I won't lie there alone，Heathcilff！I won't rest until you're in the grave with me！’</p>
<p>“看！”她说。“那是我原来的家，还有附近的教堂墓地。我不要独眠在那儿，希斯克利夫！除非你和我同穴而葬，否则我不会安息的！”</p>
<p>I was still holding her back from the window，and wondering what to do next，when Mr Edgar entered．</p>
<p>我仍然抱着她，不让她靠近窗户，搞不清下面该怎么办，这时艾加先生进来了。</p>
<p>‘Please help，sir，’I called，‘Mrs Linton is ill．’</p>
<p>“请帮帮忙，先生，”我叫道，“林顿夫人病了。”</p>
<p>‘Catherine's ill？’he gasped．‘Shut the window，Ellen！Catherine！Why—’</p>
<p>“凯瑟琳病了？”他吃了一惊。“关上窗户，艾伦！凯瑟琳！为什么——”</p>
<p>When he saw his wife's face，he was so shocked that he stopped speaking and stared at her in horror．She was almost unconscious and did not recognize him at first．</p>
<p>一看到妻子的脸，他吓坏了，话也不说了，只顾惊恐地盯着她。她几乎人事不省，开始没认出他来。</p>
<p>‘Ah，it's you，is it，Edgar Linton？'she said after a few moments．‘You don't come when you're wanted，and now you come when you're not wanted！But whatever you say，nothing can keep me from my home，my place of rest，out there in the open air，with a gravestone at my head！’</p>
<p>“噢，是你，是吗，艾加&middot;林顿？”她过了好一会儿才说道。“需要你的时候你不来，不需要的时候你倒来了！无论你怎么说，什么也别想阻止我回家，我安息的地方，在外面的旷野里，头顶上立着一块墓碑！”</p>
<p>‘She's feverish，sir，and doesn't know what she's saying，’I whispered．‘If she has food and rest，she'll recover．’</p>
<p>“她有些发烧，先生，在说胡话，”我低声说。“如果她吃了东西，再休息一下就会好的。”</p>
<p>‘I want no further advice from you，Ellen Dean，'said Mr Edgar coldly．‘You knew how ill she was，and you didn't tell me！’</p>
<p>“我不想再听你的意见，艾伦&middot;迪恩，”艾加先生冷冷地说道。“你本来知道她病得有多重，却不通报我！”</p>
<p>I ran downstairs and out of the kitchen door to fetch the doctor．I thought I heard the sound of horses in the distance，which seemed strange at two o’clock in the morning．And when I found Dr Kenneth，he told me someone had seen Isabella and Heathcliff meeting secretly in the garden earlier that evening．</p>
<p>我跑到楼下，出了厨房门去找大夫。我觉得好像听到远处有马嘶声，此刻是凌晨两点钟，似乎有点儿蹊跷。我找到肯尼士大夫时，他告诉我有人看见伊莎贝拉和希斯克利夫当天晚上早些时候在花园里幽会。</p>
<p>That night none of us slept．We all sat together and waited，while the doctor stayed with his patient．He told us he hoped that Catherine would recover，if we kept her very quiet．</p>
<p>那天晚上我们谁都没睡。大夫陪病人呆着，我们则坐在一起等。他对我们说如果我们能让她心平气和，凯瑟琳有望痊愈。</p>
<p>In the morning we discovered that Isabella's room was empty．She had run away with Heathcliff！When Mr Edgar heard the news，he just said，‘She chose to go with him．Don't speak to me of her again．I no longer think of her as my sister．’</p>
<p>到了早晨我们发现伊莎贝拉的房间空着。她跟希斯克利夫跑了！艾加先生听了这个消息，他只说，“是她自找的要跟他走。别再对我提起她。我不再认她这个妹妹。”</p><a href='9.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
