<p><b>9 伊莎贝拉的故事 </b></p>
<p>1784 For two months we heard nothing of Isabella or Heathcliff．During that time Catherine was dangerously ill with brain fever，andhDr Kenneth warned us that even if she recovered，her brain would never return to normal．How ever she did seem to get better，and no one could have been happier than my master，when he saw her sitting up in bed for the first time，and beginning to take an interest in the people and things around her．He loved her so much，and took such good care of her，that I really thought she would recover．There was another reason for her to live．She was expecting a baby，and we all hoped she would have a son，who would inherit the Linton fortune．</p>
<p>1784年。两个月来伊莎贝拉和希斯克利夫音讯全无。在这期间凯瑟琳的脑膜炎很重，肯尼士大夫提醒我们就算她病好了，她的脑子也无法完全复原。尽管如此她看上去还是好了起来，当我的主人看到她第一次在床上坐起来并开始注意她周围的人和事时，他比谁都高兴。他对她爱意无限，关心无微不至，于是我真的相信她一定会好起来。她要活下去还有另一个原因。她怀了孩子，我们都希望她能生个儿子来继承林顿家族的财产。</p>
<p>Then Mr Edgar received a letter from Isabella，telling him that she and Heathcliff were married．With it was a long letter for me，which said：</p>
<p>后来艾加先生收到了伊莎贝拉来的一封信，告诉他她已同希斯克利夫结婚了。同来的还有一封给我的长信，写道：</p>
<p>Dear Ellen，</p>
<p>亲爱的艾伦：</p>
<p>I arrived here last night and heard that Catherine brother refuses to write to me，so you are the only one I can write to．Tell Edgar I still love him and Catherine，and want to return to Thrushcross Grange，but I can't！</p>
<p>我昨晚到了呼啸山庄，听说凯瑟琳病了。我哥哥不肯给我写信，所以我只能给你写。告诉艾加我还爱着他和凯瑟琳，还想回到画眉山庄，可我不能！</p>
<p>The rest of this letter is for you alone，Ellen．Two questions—how did you manage to get on with the people in this house？Thay don't seem human！And（this interests me very much）what is Mr Heathcliff？A man？A madman？A devil？When you come to visit me，you must explain to me what sort of creature I've married．And you must come very soon，with a message from Edgar．</p>
<p>下面的内容是写给你一个人的，艾伦。有两个问题——你是怎么跟这宅子里的人相处的？他们好像没有人性！还有（我很想知道）希斯克利夫先生是什么东西？是人么？是个疯子？还是个魔鬼？你来看我的时候，你一定得跟我说说我到底嫁给了个什么东西。你一定要尽快来，带一个艾加的口信来。</p>
<p>Heathcliff brought me here last night．This house is going to be my home，he says．He disappeared as soon as we arrived，so I entered the kitchen alone．What a miserable，depressing place it is now，Ellen！By the fire stood a dirty child．I realized he must be Catherine's nephew，Hareton，and tried to shake his hand．But he greeted me by swearing at me，so I went into the hall to find somebody else．When I knocked at another door，it was opened by a tall，thin man，with long，dirty hair hanging down to his shoulders．I knew this must be Hindley Earnshaw，Catherine's brother and Hareton's father．His eyes，and Hareton's，reminded me of Catherine．</p>
<p>希斯克利夫昨晚把我带到这儿。这宅子将是我的家，他说。一到这儿他就不见了，所以我一个人进了厨房。现在那儿真是个乱七八糟、令人难受的地方，艾伦！火炉旁站着一个邋遢的孩子，我琢磨他一定就是凯瑟琳的侄子哈里顿了，于是想握握手。可他用咒骂的方式来欢迎我，所以我到厅里去找其他人。我去敲另一扇门，开门的是一个瘦高挑儿的男人，头发又长又脏，披到肩上。我知道这一定就是亨德雷&middot;欧肖，凯瑟琳的哥哥，哈里顿的父亲。他的眼睛，还有哈里顿的眼睛，让我想起凯瑟琳。</p>
<p>‘What do you want？’he asked roughly．</p>
<p>“你想干什么？”他粗鲁地问。</p>
<p>‘My name was Isabella Linton，’I replied．‘Now I'm married to Mr Heathcliff．’</p>
<p>“我叫伊莎贝拉&middot;林顿，”我回答。“我已嫁给了希斯克利夫先生。”</p>
<p>‘Ah，so that devil has returned！Good！’he growled．</p>
<p>“哦，这么说那个恶棍回来啦！好！”他咆哮道。</p>
<p>You can imagine，Ellen，how unhappy I felt in that unpleasant house．I knew that only four miles away was my real home，Thrushcross Grange，containing the only people I loved in the world．But those four miles were like an ocean，which I could not cross！Don't tell Edgar or Catherine this，but I had hoped to find a friend at Wuthering Heights，some one to support me against Heathcliff．Now I realized that no one here would help me．</p>
<p>你可以想像得到，艾伦，我在那讨厌的宅子里会多难过。我清楚这儿离我真正的家画眉山庄只有四英里，那儿有我在这世上唯一爱着的人。但那四英里像一片汪洋，我过不去！别把这个告诉艾加或凯瑟琳，我原指望能在呼啸山庄找到一个朋友，一个能帮助我对付希斯克利夫的人。如今我明白这儿没人能帮我。</p>
<p>After a long silence I said，‘Please ask a maid to show me my bedroom．I'm tired after my journey．’</p>
<p>沉默了许久之后我说，“请让个女仆带我去我的卧室。我走了那么远的路，累了。”</p>
<p>‘We have no maids here，’he answered．‘Joseph will show you Heathcliff's room，if you like．And—and—you’d better lock the bedroom door tonight！’</p>
<p>“我们这儿没有女仆，”他回答。“约瑟夫会带你去希斯克利夫的房间，如果你愿意。还有——还有——今晚你最好锁上卧室的门！”</p>
<p>‘Why，Mr Earnshaw？’I asked．I did not want to lock myself in with Heathcliff．</p>
<p>“为什么，欧肖先生？”我问。我不想把自己和希斯克利夫锁在房间里。</p>
<p>He brought out a gun，which had a knife attached to it．</p>
<p>他拿出一枝枪，上面还带着一把刀子。</p>
<p>‘Look at this，’he said．‘Every night I try to open his bed room door．Up to now he's locked it．But one night he'll forget，and Then I'll kill him！’</p>
<p>“看看这个，”他说。“我每天晚上都想橇开他卧室的门。到目前为止他都上锁。可要是哪天晚上他忘了，我就会杀了他！”</p>
<p>‘Why do you hate him so much？’I asked．</p>
<p>“你为什么这么恨他？”我问。</p>
<p>‘Because he's taken everything from me！’he shouted angrily．‘There's nothing left for Hareton to inherit！But I'm going to get it all back！and his money too，and then his blood．Then the devil can have his soul！’</p>
<p>“因为他抢走了我的一切！”他嚎道。“什么也没剩下让哈里顿去继承！但我会把它全夺回来的！还有他的钱，还有他的血。然后魔鬼就能收去他的灵魂！”</p>
<p>He seemed mad to me，Ellen．I left him，and went to find the old servant，Joseph．It seemed that Heathcliff's room was locked，and there were no guest bedrooms，so in the end I slept on a chair in the child's room．What a welcome to my new home！</p>
<p>我看他好像疯了，艾伦。我离开了他，去找那个老仆约瑟夫。希斯克利夫的房间似乎是锁着的，也没有给客人住的卧室，所以最后我在孩子的房里睡下了。到了我的新家，他们就这么欢迎我！</p>
<p>I know Heathcliff blames Edgar forQCatherine's illness．He has warned me he'll make me suffer for it．Oh，I do hate him—I'm so miserable—I've been such a fool！Don't tell any one at Thrushcross Grange about this，Ellen．Come quickly—don't disappoint me！</p>
<p>我明白希斯克利夫把凯瑟琳的病归咎于艾加。他威胁过我，要我为此吃苦头。啊，我真恨他——我真命苦——我真是个傻瓜！别对画眉山庄的任何人讲，艾伦。快来吧——别让我失望！</p>
<p>Isabella</p>
<p>伊莎贝拉于呼啸山庄</p>
<p>As soon as I had read this，I asked Mr Edgar if I could take a message from him to his sister．</p>
<p>一读完信，我就问艾加先生我能否替他给他妹妹带个口信。</p>
<p>‘You may visit her this afternoon，Ellen，if you like．Tell her I'm not angry，just sorry to have lost her．I can't imagine she will ever be happy．I shall never visit her or write to her．’</p>
<p>“你今天下午可以去看她，艾伦，如果你愿意。告诉她我不是生气，只是为失去她而难过。我无法想像她会幸福。我不会再看她，也不会给她写信。”</p>
<p>When I arrived at Wuthering Heights that afternoon，I was shocked to see how much worse the house looked than when I used to live there．I realized that Hindley did not care what conditions he lived in，and Joseph clearly spent more time praying than cleaning．Heathcliff and Isabella were both in the main room．Heathcliff looked more like a gentleman than I had ever seen him，but his wife had not bothered to brush her hair or change her dress．I had to explain to poor Isabella that Mr Edgar had refused to write to her．She cried a little when she heard that．Then Heathcliff asked me question after question about Catherine's illness．</p>
<p>那天下午我到呼啸山庄时，看到房子比我以前住的时候脏乱得多，我很吃惊。我想到亨德雷不在乎他住的环境，约瑟夫花在祈祷上的时间无疑比打扫卫生多。希斯克利夫和伊莎贝拉都在正房里。希斯克利夫比我以前任何时候看到他时都更像个绅士，可他的妻子却懒得梳理头发、更换衣服。我不得不向可怜的伊莎贝拉解释说艾加先生不肯给她写信。她听到这个哭了一会儿。然后希斯克利夫就一遍一遍地问我凯瑟琳的病情。</p>
<p>‘If you really love her，’I told him，‘you'll keep away from her now．She mustn't be over-excited Her health will always be weak．And her loving husband is a very good nurse to her！’</p>
<p>“要是你真的爱她，”我对他说，“你现在就离她远点。她不能太激动。她的身体一直都会很弱。她那深情的丈夫把她护理得非常好！”</p>
<p>‘Her loving husband！'repeated Heathcliff scornfully．‘Don't compare my feeling for her with his！No，Ellen，before you leave this house，I'll make you promise to arrange a meet- ing for me with Catherine．I must see her！’</p>
<p>“她那深情的丈夫！”希斯克利夫讥讽地重复了一句。“别把我对她的感情与他的相比！不，艾伦，你离开这房子之前，我要让你答应安排我与凯瑟琳见一面。我一定要见她！”</p>
<p>‘I'll never agree to that，’I said．‘She's just beginning to recover．She's almost forgotten you，and now you want to upset her again！’ ‘Ellen，you know as well as I do that she can never forget me！If she thinks once of Edgar Linton，she thinks a thousand times of me！He can't love her as I can！And Catherine has a heart as deep as mine！’</p>
<p>“我决不会答应的，”我说。“她刚刚开始恢复。她差不多把你忘了，而你现在又要再去惹她！”“艾伦，你我都知道她决不会忘了我！如果她想起艾加&middot;林顿一次，她就会想我一千次！他不会像我那样爱她！凯瑟琳有一颗如我一般深情的心！”</p>
<p>‘Catherine and Edgar are very fond of each other！'said Isabella suddenly．‘Don't speak of my brother like that！’</p>
<p>“凯瑟琳和艾加彼此非常相亲相爱！”伊莎贝拉突然说道。“别那样说我哥哥！”</p>
<p>‘Your dear brother doesn't care enough abut you to write to you，'replied Heathcliff，smiling sourly．</p>
<p>“你那亲爱的哥哥对你的关心还不足以让他给你写信，”希斯克利夫回道，悻悻地一笑。</p>
<p>‘That's because be doesn't know how much I've suffered，'she answered quietly，turning away to hide the tears on her face．</p>
<p>“那是因为他不知道我有多苦，”她静静地回答道，她转过身去不让人看见她脸上的泪水。</p>
<p>‘Sir，’I said，‘it seems to me that Miss Isabella，Mrs Heathcliff，I should say，is unhappy．You must treat her kindly．Try to look after her．Let her have a maid，for example．’</p>
<p>“先生，”我说，“伊莎贝拉小姐，我应该说是希斯克利夫夫人，好像不高兴。你得对她好点。尽量照顾她。比如说，给她找个女仆。”</p>
<p>‘I'm not going to be soft with her，’he repliedd with a laugh．‘She was stupid enough to run away with me．I never pretended to love her．Now I think she's beginning to realize that I scorn her．She's an even weaker fool than her brother， but she's going to be useful to me．That's why I'm keeping her with me．’ ‘Ellen，he says he married me to have his revenge on Edgar！But I won't let him carry out his plan，whatever it is． I'll die，or I'll see him dead first！’</p>
<p>“我不会对她来软的，”他笑着答道。“她太傻了，跟我私奔。我从没假装爱她。此刻我想她开始明白我看不起她。她甚至比他哥哥还软弱愚蠢，但她对我会有用。所以我才留她在我这儿。”“艾伦，他说他娶我是为了报复艾加！不管他打什么鬼主意，我不会让他得逞的。要么我死，要么我要看着他先死！”</p>
<p>‘You're getting violent，Isabella！'said Heathcliff．‘Go up- stairs now．I want to speak to Ellen Dean in private．Go on！’ And he pushed her roughly out of the door． ‘Don't you feel pity for her？’I asked，when we were alone．‘Have you ever felt pity for anybody in your life？’ ‘Why should I？She's just like an insect under my foot．The more she cries，the more I enjoy hurting her．Now，Ellen，lis-ten．I'll wait every day and every evening in the Grange gar- den，until I find a chance to see Catherine．If I meet Edgar Linton or his servants，I'll shoot them．But don't you think it’d be better to avoid a fight？You could tell me when she'll be alone．Then there'll be no violence．’</p>
<p>“你开始过激了，伊莎贝拉！”希斯克利夫说道。“现在上楼去。我想同艾伦&middot;迪恩单独谈谈。快去！”他粗野地把她推出门外。“难道你不怜悯她吗？”只剩我们两个时我问。“你这一生可曾怜悯过什么人吗？”“我为什么要怜悯？她就像我脚下的一只虫子。她越叫唤，我就越喜欢折磨她。好了，艾伦，听着。我每天从早到晚都会在画眉山庄的花园里等着，直到我有机会看到凯瑟琳为止。要是让我遇上艾加&middot;林顿或他的家仆，我就开枪打死他们。可你不觉得最好能避免一场争斗吗？你可以告诉我什么时候她单独在。这样就不会有伤害了。”</p>
<p>I argued and complained，and refused fifty times，but in the end he forced me to agree．I promised to let him know when Edgar Linton was away from home．I suppose it was wrong of me，but I hoped it would be Heathcliff's last meeting with Catherine．</p>
<p>尽管我同他争执、抱怨，无数次地拒绝，但最终他还是强迫我答应下来。我应允艾加&middot;林顿出门的时候通知他。我觉得我做得不对，但我希望着这是希斯克利夫最后一次见凯瑟琳。</p><a href='10.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
