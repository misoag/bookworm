<p><b>7 希斯克利夫回来了 </b></p>
<p>1783 Well，sir，when Miss Catherine became Mrs Linton，and we went to live at Thrushcross Grange，I must say I was surprised and pleased by her behaviour．She showed great fondness for her husband，and for his sister，Isabella．He，of course，was very anxious that no one should disobey her，or make her angry．If she was depressed for a time，he blamed it on the illness she had had，and was sympathetic．But for most of the time，I believe they shared a deep and growing love for each other．</p>
<p>1783年。好的，先生。凯瑟琳小姐成了林顿夫人，我们就去住到画眉山庄，我得说她的表现让我又惊又喜。她看上去对丈夫非常疼爱，对他妹妹伊莎贝拉也不错。自然，他很上心不叫人逆她的愿或给她气生。在她心情郁闷时，他就归咎于她得的那场病，大加同情。但在大部分时间里，我相信他们相互之间的深情不断增长着。</p>
<p>Unfortunately this happiness did not last．One evening I was bringing in a basket of apples from the garden，when a voice behind me said，‘Ellen，is that you？’</p>
<p>遗憾的是这种幸福没有持续下去。一天晚上，我正拎着一篮子苹果从花园往家里去，这时我身后有一个声音说道，“艾伦，是你么？”</p>
<p>It was a deep，rather unusual voice．I turned，to see a tall，dark man in the shadow near the kitchen door．</p>
<p>这声音低沉，不大熟悉。我转过身，看到在厨房门旁的阴暗处有一个又高又黑的人。</p>
<p>‘Don't you know me？’he asked．‘Look，I'm not a stranger！’</p>
<p>“你不认识我了？”他问道，“瞧，我不是个生人！”</p>
<p>‘What！’I cried in surprise，for it had been four years since he dusappeared．‘Heathcliff！Is it really you？’</p>
<p>“什么！”我惊叫道，因为他已经失踪四年了，“希斯克利夫！真是你吗？”</p>
<p>‘Yes，’he replied，looking up at the windows of the house．‘Are they at home？Where is she？Tell me，Ellen！I must speak to her！’</p>
<p>“是的，”他回答，抬头看着房子的窗户。“他们在家吗？她在哪儿？告诉我，艾伦！我得和她说话！”</p>
<p>‘I'm not sure if you should see her，’I hesitated．‘Will the shock be too much for her？</p>
<p>“我说不好你是不是应该见她，”我犹豫道。“这会不会对她太突然了？”</p>
<p>‘Go and tell her I'm here，Ellen！’he said impatiently．‘Don't make me suffer like this！’</p>
<p>“去通报她我在这儿，艾伦！”他不耐烦地说。“别让我这样受苦！”</p>
<p>I left him at the door，and went upstairs to find Mr and Mrs Linton．They were sitting quietly together，looking out over the peaceful valley．The room，and the view，and the two people，seemed so calm that I did not want to disturb them．But I had to deliver my message．</p>
<p>我把他留在门口，上楼去找林顿夫妇。他们静静地坐在一起，眺望着宁静的山谷。这房间、这景致，还有那两个人，看上去那么平和安宁，我真不愿打搅他们。可我不得不通报讯息。</p>
<p>‘A man wants to see you，madam，’I muttered．</p>
<p>“有个人想见您，夫人，”我低声说。</p>
<p>‘I'll go downstairs and see him then，'replied Catherine．‘Bring the tea up，Ellen，while I'm away．’She left the room．</p>
<p>“那我就下楼去见他，”凯瑟琳答应。“艾伦，我不在这会儿你把茶端上来。”她离开了房间。</p>
<p>‘Who is it，Ellen？’asked Mr Edgar．</p>
<p>“是谁，艾伦？”艾加先生问。</p>
<p>‘It's that Heathcliff，sir．You remember，he used to live at Wuthering Heights．’</p>
<p>“是那个希斯克利夫，先生。您记得，他以前住在呼啸山庄。”</p>
<p>‘What！The gipsy，who worked on the farm？’he cried．</p>
<p>“什么！那个吉卜赛人，在农庄干活儿的那个？”他叫喊道。</p>
<p>‘Mrs Linton would be angry if she heardpyou talking about him like that，sir．She was very upset when he ran away．She's very fond of him，you know．’</p>
<p>“先生，如果林顿夫人听见您这么说他，会生气的。他出走时她很难过。她非常喜欢他，这您知道。”</p>
<p>Mr Edgar put his head out of the window and called to his wife，‘Don't stand there in the cold，love！Bring the person in，if it's anyone special．’</p>
<p>艾加先生把头探出窗子，高声对他妻子说，“别站在凉地里，亲爱的！要是贵客，就把他带进来。”</p>
<p>Catherine rushed upstairs and into the room，wild and breathless．She threw her arms round her husband's neck．</p>
<p>凯瑟琳冲上楼进了房间，兴奋若狂，气喘吁吁。她张开双臂，一下搂住了丈夫的脖子。</p>
<p>‘Oh Edgar darling！Heathcliff's come back！’</p>
<p>“哦，亲爱的艾加！希斯克利夫回来啦！”</p>
<p>‘Well，well，'said Mr Edgar crossly，‘there's no need to get excited．’</p>
<p>“好，好，”艾加先生不痛快地说道，“没有必要激动。”</p>
<p>‘I know you didn't like him，'she said，‘but please，I beg you tobbe friends with him now．Shall I ask him to come up？’</p>
<p>“我知道你不喜欢他，”她说，“但求求你，我乞求你现在跟他做朋友。我能让他上来么？”</p>
<p>‘You're suggesting inviting him up here，into our siting room？Don't you think the kitchen is more suitable for him？’</p>
<p>“你想请他上到这儿，到我们的起居室？你难道不觉得他去厨房更妥当吗？”</p>
<p>Catherine looked at her husband，half angry and half laughing．‘No，'she said，‘I can't sit in the kitchen．Ellen，bring two tables，one for your master and Miss Isabella，the other for Heathcliff and myself．We'll sit apart from them，as we're of a lower class！Will that please you，Edgar darling？Decide quickly！I must have him near me！’</p>
<p>凯瑟琳似怒似笑地看着她的丈夫。“不，”她说，“我不能坐到厨房里。艾伦，搬两张桌子，一张给你的主人和伊莎贝拉，另一张给希斯克利夫和我。我们不跟他们一起坐，因为我们层次低！这样你高兴了罢，亲爱的艾加？快拿主意！我必须让他离我近点！”</p>
<p>‘Ellen，you go and bring him up，'said Mr Edgar．‘And Catherine，try not to behave foolishly．Remember，he's only a servant！’</p>
<p>“艾伦，你去把他领上来，”艾加先生说，“还有，凯瑟琳，你别做傻事。记住，他只是个下人！”</p>
<p>When Heathcliff entered the sitting-room，I was surprised to see how much he had changed．He wore a confident，intelligent expression on his face，and his manner was no longer rough．Although I recognized the same black fire in his eyes，the farm boy had become a gentleman．</p>
<p>当希斯克利夫进到起居室，我惊讶地看到他变化太大了。他脸上带着自信、睿智的表情，举止也不再粗野。虽然我还能看出他的眼中依然有一团黑色的火焰，但这个干农活的小伙子已经变成了一个绅士。</p>
<p>Mr Edgar was as surprised as I was，but welcomed Heath cliff as politely as he could．However，he grew more and more annoyed as he watched his wife's delighted face．She could not take her eyes off Heathcliff．</p>
<p>艾加先生同我一样感到惊讶，但他还是尽可能礼貌地对他表示欢迎。可当看到妻子满脸喜色，他越来越气恼。她的目光无法离开希斯克利夫。</p>
<p>‘Tomorrow I won't be able tohbelieve that I've seen and touched you，Heathcliff！'she cried，catching hold of his hands．‘But how cruel of you to run away and keep silent for four years，and never think of me！’</p>
<p>“到明天我都不能相信我已经见到了你，摸到了你，希斯克利夫！”她抓住他的手，兴奋地说，“可你多忍心啊！出走之后杳无音讯都四年了，也从不想我！”</p>
<p>‘I've thought of you more than you've thought of me，’he replied quietly．‘I heard you had married，Catherine，and I came，just to see you once，and then take my revenge on your brother Hindley．Your welcome may change my plans．You know，I've had a bitter，hard life since I last heard your voice，and If I've survived，it's all because of you！’</p>
<p>“我想你要比你想我多，”他平静地说，“我听说你结婚了，凯瑟琳，我是来见你一面，然后去报复你哥哥亨德雷的。你对我的欢迎也许会改变我的计划。从最后一次听到你声音到现在，我一直过着辛酸艰苦的生活，如果说我还能幸存下来，那都是为了你！”</p>
<p>‘Catherine，'said Mr Edgar，trying to remain polite，‘please pour out the tea，or it will be cold．Mr Heathcliff will have a long walk to wherever he's staying tonight，and I'm thirsty．’</p>
<p>“凯瑟琳，”艾加先生说道，尽量保持着礼节，“请倒茶吧，否则就凉了。希斯克利夫先生还要走一段长路到他今晚住的地方，我也渴了。”</p>
<p>But Catherine was too excited，and Mr Edgar too angry，to drink any tea．After a while their guest left．We discovered that he had been invited to stay at Wuthering Heights，by Hindley．I could not understand why Hindley，who hated him，would want his company，and I felt sure it would have been better for all of us if Heathcliff had never come back．</p>
<p>但凯瑟琳兴奋异常，而艾加先生怒气很盛，茶都喝不下。过了一会儿，他们的客人走了。我们发现他被请去住在呼啸山庄，是亨德雷先生邀请的。我无法理解亨德雷那么恨他，为何还想和他在一起，我也肯定如果希斯克利夫压根儿没回来对我们大家都会更好些。</p>
<p>Catherine could not keep her happiness to herself．In the middle of the night she woke me to talk about Heathcliff．</p>
<p>凯瑟琳无法独享她的快乐。大半夜叫醒我聊希斯克利夫的事。</p>
<p>‘I just can't sleep，Ellen！'she said．‘And Edgar won't lis ten when I tell him how happy I am！He's so selfish！’</p>
<p>“我就是睡不着，艾伦！”她说，“我要跟艾加讲我有多高兴，他又不肯听！他真自私！”</p>
<p>‘He never liked Heathcliff，’I replied，‘and he'll be angry if you go on talking about him．You think he's weak，but he could be as determined as you，about something he thinks is important．’</p>
<p>“他向来不喜欢希斯克利夫，”我回答，“如果你再谈他，他会生气的。你认为他软弱，但只要是他认为重要的事。他可能像你一样执著。”</p>
<p>‘No！'she laughed．‘I have such confidence in Edgar's love that I think I could kill him，and he wouldn't blame me for it．He will have to learn to accept Heathcliff as my friend．’</p>
<p>“不！”她笑道，“我对艾加的爱太有信心了，我想我就是杀了他，他也不会怪我的。他要学会把希斯克利夫当我的朋友来接受。”</p>
<p>‘Do you know why Heathcliff is staying at Wuthering Heights？’</p>
<p>“你知道希斯克利夫为什么住在呼啸山庄吗？”</p>
<p>‘Oh，yes．He explained that he went there to look for me．Hindley asked him to play cards，and when he discovered Heathcliff had a lot of money，invited him to stay there．You know how greedy my brother is．He'll make Heathcliff pay rent，and hope to win money from him at cards．Heathcliff wants to stay there to be near me．I'm so happy，Ellen！And I want everyone around me to be happy too！’</p>
<p>“噢，是的。他解释说他去那儿找我。亨德雷请他玩牌，当他看出希斯克利夫很有钱，就请他住在那儿了。你知道我哥哥有多贪财。他会收希斯克利夫的租金，而且指望玩牌赢他的钱。希斯克利夫住在那儿是想离我近点儿。我真高兴，艾伦！我希望我身边的每个人也都高兴！”</p>
<p>Catherine behaved so sweetly to her husband in the next few days that Thrushcross Grange seemed full of sunshine，and in spite of his doubts，Mr Edgar allowed Heathcliff to visit her regularly．However，Heathcliff's visits produced a result which none of us had expected．Isabella，Mr Edgar's sister，a pretty girl of eighteen，suddenly declared that she was in love with Heathcliff．Mr Edgar，who loved her dearly，was shocked．He knew that if he and Catherine had no sons，Isabella would inherit the considerable Linton fortune．He did not like the idea of the fortune passing to Heathcliff，as Isabella's husband．But more importantly，he suspected that Heathcliff was hiding his ture wickedness under his gentleman ly appearance．</p>
<p>在接下去的日子里凯瑟琳对她丈夫表现得非常亲热，画眉山庄似乎阳光明媚，因此尽管艾加先生心存疑窦，他还是允许希斯克利夫常来看她。然而希斯克利夫的来访却导致了一个我们都未曾料想的结果。艾加先生的妹妹伊莎贝拉，一个18岁的可爱姑娘，突如其来地公开说她爱上了希斯克利夫。艾加先生对妹妹十分钟爱，对此感到震惊。他明白如果他与凯瑟琳没有儿子的话，伊莎贝拉将继承林顿家族相当可观的财产。他不想让财产落入成了伊莎贝拉丈夫的希斯克利夫手中。而更非同小可的是，他怀疑在希斯克利夫绅士般的外表下隐藏着真实的险恶居心。</p>
<p>Catherine tried hard to persuade Isabella that Heathcliff was not worth loving，but poor Isabella was jealous of Catherine's relationship with Heathcliff and would not listen．Finally，Catherine told Heathcliff himself that Isabella was in love with him．She thought she knew what his answer would be．</p>
<p>凯瑟琳竭力劝伊莎贝拉说希斯克利夫不值得她爱，但可怜的伊莎贝拉妒嫉凯瑟琳与希斯克利夫的关系，对此听不进去。最后，凯瑟琳告诉希斯克利夫本人说伊莎贝拉爱上了他。她以为自己知道他会怎么回答。</p>
<p>‘How could I ever love that stupid girl？’he asked．‘She has a miserable pale face，and weak blue eyes，just like your husband！But…she will inherit the family wealth from him，won't she？’</p>
<p>“我怎么能爱那个傻姑娘？”他反问道，“她那张脸凄惨苍白，一双蓝眼睛也毫无神采，像你丈夫似的！可……她将从他那儿继承家族的财产，对吧？”</p>
<p>‘That's true，'replied Catherine．‘But don't think about that，Heathcliff．I hope Edgar and I will have several sons，and then they will inherit it．’</p>
<p>“对，”凯瑟琳答道，“但别惦记那个，希斯克利夫。我希望艾加和我会生几个儿子，然后他们来继承财产。”</p>
<p>Catherine did not speak of this matter again，but I am sure Heathcliff often thought about it．I watched him carefully in the next few days．I hoped he would do nothing to hurt Mr Edgar，who was a kind master to me．I was worried，too，about what was happening at Wuthering Heights．Hindley and his son Hareton seemed like lost sheep to me，and I knew there was a wicked wolf just waiting for the chance to attack them．</p>
<p>凯瑟琳没再提起这件事，可我肯定希斯克利夫经常在盘算着它。在过后的几天里我留心观察他。我希望他别做什么伤害艾加先生的事，艾加先生对我是个仁慈的主人。我也在担心呼啸山庄的事态如何。在我看来，亨德雷和他儿子哈里顿像是迷途的绵羊，而我知道有一只恶狼正在伺机对他们发起进攻。</p><a href='8.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
