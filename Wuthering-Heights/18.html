<p>1801—2 I was delighted to come back to the Heights，and hoped I could make Cathy's life more comfortable．But she was restless，and complained of loneliness．At first she continued to annoy Hareton，by laughing at him，but after a while she decided she really wanted him as a friend．She apologized for being rude to him，and offered to teach him ev erything she knew．From that moment on，the two cousins have always been together，studying．Hareton has a lot to learn，and Cathy is not the most patient of teachers．But what they have in common is their love for each other．You see，Mr Lockwood，it was easy enough to win Cathy's heart．But now I'm glad you didn't try．I'll be the happiest woman in England when those two marry！</p>
<p>Heathcliff noticed little of what was happening around him，and would never have been aware of the cousins’feelings，if it hadn't been for Joseph．In the middle of our lunch one day，the old man rushed into the room，shaking with anger．</p>
<p>‘I'll have to leave！I wanted to die here，where I've been a servant for sixty years！But now she's taken my garden from me！She's stolen the boy's soul，master！I can't bear it！’</p>
<p>‘Is the fool drunk？’asked Heathcliff．‘Can you explain this，Hareton？’</p>
<p>‘I've pulled up two or three of his fruit-trees，’confessed Hareton，‘but I'll put them back again．’</p>
<p>‘It was my fault，’added Cathy bravely．‘I asked him to do it．We wanted to plant some flowers there．’</p>
<p>‘Who the devil gave you permission？’growled Heathcliff．</p>
<p>‘You should let me have a bit of garden，as you've taken all my land！'replied Cathy sharply．‘And you've taken Hareton's land too！He and I are friends now！I'll tell him about you！’</p>
<p>The master stood up，staring at her fiercely．</p>
<p>‘Out of the room，wicked girl！’he shouted．‘I'll kill you if I get near you！’</p>
<p>‘If you hit me，Hareton will hit you．He won't obey you any more，and soon he'll hate you as much as I do！’</p>
<p>‘You’d better leave，Cathy，’whispered Hareton urgently．‘I won't quarrel with Mr Heathcliff．’</p>
<p>But it was too late．I was sure Heathcliff was going to hit her．He took hold of her，one strong hand in her hair and the other raised over her head．But when he looked into her face，his anger suddenly disappeared，and he let his arm fall to his side．He sat heavily down in his chair and put his hand over his eyes for a moment．We all stared at him．</p>
<p>‘You must learn not to make me angry，’he said，trying to be calm．‘Go away，all of you！Leave me alone！’A little later he went out，saying he would return in the evening．</p>
<p>As darkness fell，Cathy and Hareton were busy at their studies in the kitchen．I was sitting with them，happy to see them helping each other so well．I feel they're almost my children，Mr Lockwood，and I'm very proud of them．As the master entered the house，he had a full view of us three．They lifted their eyes to meet his．Perhaps you haven't noticed it，but their eyes are very similar，and they are exactly like those of Catherine Earnshaw．Mr Heathcliff stopped and stared，then looked away．At a sign from me，Cathy and Hareton went quietly out into the garden，leaving me alone with Mr Heathcliff．</p>
<p>‘It's silly，isn't it，Ellen，’he muttered，‘that I have worked all my life to destroy these two families，the Earn shaws and the Lintons．I've got their money and their land．Now I can take my final revenge on the last Earnshaw and the last Linton，I no longer want to！There's a strange change coming in my life．I'm in its shadow．I'm so little interested in daily events that I even forget to eat and drink．I don't want to see those two，that's why I don't care if they spend time together．She only makes me angry．And he looks so like Catherine！But everything reminds me of Catherine！In every cloud，in every tree I see her face！The whole world reminds me that she was here once，and I have lost her！’</p>
<p>‘You don't feel ill，sir，do you？Are you afraid of death？’</p>
<p>‘I'm not ill，Ellen，and I'm not afraid to die．But I can't continue like this！I have to remind myself to breathe—almost to remind my heart to beat！I have a single wish，for some thing my whole body and heart and brain have wanted for so long！Oh God！It's a long fight！I wish it were finished！’</p>
<p>For some days after that，Mr Heathcliff avoided meeting us at meals．He ate less and less．Late one night I heard him leave the house．He did not return until the morning．When he came in，I noticed a change in his expression．There was a strange，wild happiness in his face，although he was pale and trembling．</p>
<p>‘Will you have some breakfast，sir？’I asked．</p>
<p>‘No，I'm not hungry，’he answered．</p>
<p>‘I don't think you should stay outside at night，sir．You'll catch a bad cold or a fever！’</p>
<p>‘Leave me alone，Ellen，’he replied．</p>
<p>I began to worry about him．He was strong and healthy，but a man must eat in order to live．For the next three days he ate nothing．At every meal the food lay untouched on the plate in front of him．He did not look at the food，or at us．He seemed to be looking at something quite close to him，some thing we could not see．His fierce black eyes followed it with such eager interest that he sometimes stopped breathing for as much as half a minute．</p>
<p>He did not sleep either．For three days he had spent the night in Catherine Earnshaw's old bedroom，and I could hear him walking up and down，and talking，calling，crying all night．</p>
<p>One morning I managed to speak to him，and make him listen to me．‘Mr Heathcliff，you must have some food and sleep．Look at yourself in the mirror！You look ill and tired．’</p>
<p>‘It's not my fault that I can't eat or rest．You wouldn't tell a drowning man to rest when he can see the shore！I'm close to what I've wanted for eighteen years，very close！But my soul's happiness is killing my body！’</p>
<p>‘It's a strange kind of happiness，master．Take my advice，and pray to God to forgive you for what you've done wrong in the past，if you think you're going to die．’</p>
<p>‘Thank you，Ellen，you've reminded me of something．It's the way I want to be buried．My coffin will be carried to the churchyard in the evening．You and Hareton will be present，nobody else．And make sure my orders about the two coffins are obeyed！I want no ceremony，or words from the Bible—I don't believe in any of that．’</p>
<p>He spent the next night，and the next day，in Catherine's room，muttering and sobbing all the time．I sent for Dr Kenneth，but the door was locked，so the doctor could not see him．The following night was very wet，and in the morning as I walked in the garden，I noticed that the bedroom window was wide open．</p>
<p>‘He must be very wet if he's in bed，’I thought，‘the bed is so close to the window．I'll go and look．’I found another key which fitted the lock，and opened the door．Mr Heathcliff was there in bed，lying on his back．His eyes were staring at me，so eagerly and fiercely，and he seemed to be smiling！His face and clothes were wet from the rain，and he did not move．I realized he was dead！</p>
<p>I closed the window．I combed his long，black hair from his forehead．I tried to close his eyes，but they would not shut．Suddenly frightened，I called for Joseph．The old servant came at once，but refused to touch the body．</p>
<p>‘Ah，the devil's taken his soul！I warned him that would happen！’he cried．‘You see how wicked he is，smiling at death！But thank God Hareton Earnshaw will have the house and land now，that he should have inherited from his father！’And he went down on his knees to pray．</p>
<p>Hareton was，in fact，the only one who was sad at Heathcliff's death．He and I were present at the burial．Heathcliff was buried next to Catherine's grave，as he had wished．As we were not sure of his age or anything else about him，there is only one word on his gravestone—Heathcliff．The villagers are very frightened of his ghost．They say he often haunts the churchyard and the moors．</p>
<p>Hareton and Cathy will be married on New Year's Day，and they'll move to the Grange．I'll be their housekeeper．Joseph will take care of Wuthering Heights，but most of the rooms here won't be used again．</p>
<p>You'll pass the churchyard，Mr Lockwood，on your way back to the Grange，and you'll see the three gravestones close to the moor．Catherine's，the middle one，is old now，and half buried in plants which have grown over it．On one side is Edgar Linton's，and on the other is Heathcliff's new one．If you stay there a moment，and watch the insects flying in the warm summer air，and listen to the soft wind breathing through the grass，you'll understand how quietly they rest，the sleepers in that quiet earth．</p>
<p><b>18 希斯克利夫的结局 </b></p>
<p>1801—1802年。回到呼啸山庄我很高兴，我希望能使凯茜的生活过的更舒心些。可她很烦躁，抱怨说孤独。开始她还招惹哈里顿，嘲笑他，但过了一段时间她觉得自己真的想要他做朋友。她为自己对他的无礼道了歉，并提出要把她会的一切都教给他。从此，这两个表兄妹就形影不离，在一起学习。哈里顿有好些要学的，而凯茜又不是个很耐心的老师。但他们的共同点是他们彼此相爱。你看，洛克伍德先生，要赢得凯茜小姐的心不难。可现在我庆幸您没有试。他们俩结婚时我就是英格兰最幸福的女人了！</p>
<p>希斯克利夫对他身边发生的事几乎没有注意到，如果要不是约瑟夫，他也决不会察觉这对表兄妹的感情。一天，我们正吃着午饭，那个老头冲进屋里，气得浑身发抖。</p>
<p>“我得离开！我本想死在这儿，我在这儿做了60年的仆人！可她现在把我花园抢走了！她偷走了这孩子的魂儿，主人！我无法忍受了！”</p>
<p>“这傻瓜喝醉了？”希斯克利夫问。“你能解释一下吗，哈里顿？”</p>
<p>“我拔了他两三棵果树，”哈里顿坦白道，“但我会把它们种回去的。”</p>
<p>“是我的锗，”凯茜大胆地插话道，“是我让他拔的。我们想在那儿种些花儿。”</p>
<p>“谁他妈的批准的？”希斯克利夫咆哮道。</p>
<p>“你把我全部土地都拿走了，总该让我有一片花园吧！”凯茜不饶地反驳道。“而且你还夺走了哈里顿的土地！他和我现在是朋友！我要把你的事告诉他！”</p>
<p>主人站了起来，两眼恶狠狠地盯着她。</p>
<p>“滚出这房间，坏丫头！”他嚷道。“要是让我走近你，我会杀了你！”</p>
<p>“如果你打我，哈里顿会打你的。他不会再听你的话，过不了多久，他也会像我一样恨你！”</p>
<p>“你最好离开这儿，凯茜，”哈里顿小声催促道。“我不会同希斯克利夫先生争吵。”</p>
<p>但太晚了。我肯定希斯克利夫要打她了。他抓住她，一只大手揪住她的头发，另一只手举过了她头顶。可当他看到她的脸的时候，怒气突然消失了，把手臂放了下来。他重重地坐回椅子上，双手捂住眼睛呆了一会儿。我们都目不转睛地看着他。</p>
<p>“你要学着别惹我生气，”他说道，想镇静下来，“滚开，都滚！别烦我！”不一会儿他出去了，说晚上回来。</p>
<p>夜幕降临，凯茜和哈里顿在厨房忙着学习。我在旁边坐着，看到他们互帮互助处得那样融洽我很高兴。我觉得他们是我自己的孩子似的，洛克伍德先生，我为他们感到非常自豪。主人进到房子时，一眼就看见了我们三个。他们抬起眼，与希斯克利夫相对而视。可能您没留意，他们俩的眼睛很相像，而且跟凯瑟琳&middot;欧肖的眼睛几乎一模一样。希斯克利夫先生站住凝视了一会儿，然后眼光转向了别处。我叹了口气，凯茜和哈里顿悄悄溜进了花园，只剩下我和希斯克利夫先生。</p>
<p>“真傻，是吧，艾伦，”他喃喃道，“我倾尽一生精力要摧毁这两个家庭，欧肖和林顿家。我得到了他们的钱财和土地。如今我可以对最后一个姓欧肖的和最后一个姓林顿的施加最后的报复，我却不想干了！我的生命里发生着奇怪的变化，我正处在这变化的阴影之中。我对日常的事务提不起兴趣，甚至想不起吃喝。我不想见到他们俩，所以我不管他们是不是在一起。她只会惹我生气，而他长得真象凯瑟琳！可什么东西都能让我想起凯瑟琳来！在每一朵云团、每一棵树上我都能看到她的脸！整个世界都在提醒我她曾经在这儿，而我却失去了她！”</p>
<p>“您没感到不舒服吧，先生，是吗？您惧怕死么？”</p>
<p>“我没病，艾伦，我也不怕死。可我不能继续这样下去了！我得提醒自己要喘气——几乎得提醒自己的心去跳！我只有一个愿望，那是我许久以来殚精竭力、挖空心思想得到的东西！噢，上帝！这是一场漫长的搏斗！我希望它结束吧！”</p>
<p>在以后的几天里，希斯克利夫先生吃饭的时候躲着我们。他吃得越来越少。有一天深夜我听见他出了宅子，第二天上午才回来。他进来时，我注意到他神情有些异样。尽管气色苍白、全身颤抖，可脸上洋溢着诡秘、疯狂的喜悦。</p>
<p>“您用点早餐吗，先生？”我问。</p>
<p>“不，我不饿，”他回答。</p>
<p>“我觉得您不该在外面过夜，先生。您会感冒发烧的！”</p>
<p>“别管我，艾伦，”他回答。</p>
<p>我开始为他担心。他身体强健，但要活着总要吃饭呀。此后三天他什么也没吃，每顿饭放到他面前他都没动。他根本不看饭菜，也不看我们。他似乎在看着就在他身边的什么东西，我们却看不见。他炽烈的黑眼睛聚精会神地紧盯着它，有时甚至半分钟也不喘气。</p>
<p>他也不睡觉。他在凯瑟琳&middot;欧肖从前住的卧室里连续呆了三个晚上，我能听到他走来走去，整夜地说话、嗥叫、痛哭。</p>
<p>一天早晨我跟他搭话，让他听我的。“希斯克利夫先生，你一定得吃得睡。用镜子看看您自己！您看上去疲病交加的。”</p>
<p>“我吃不下、睡不着不是我的错。当一个快淹死的人看见岸边时，你不会让他歇息吧！我就要得到18年来梦寐以求的东西，快了！可我灵魂的欢乐扼杀着我的肉体！”</p>
<p>“那是一种怪诞的欢乐，主人。听我的，如果您认为自己将不久于人世，就祈求上帝宽恕您以往的过错吧。”</p>
<p>“谢谢，艾伦，你提醒了我一件事，是关于我下葬的方式。我的棺材要在晚上抬到教堂墓地。你和哈里顿要在场，不要别人。要保证按我放置两口棺材的命令去做！我不要葬礼，也不要读《圣经》——我一概不信。”</p>
<p>他当天晚上和第二天白天都呆在凯瑟琳的房间，一直在喃喃自语和呜咽抽泣。我叫人去找肯尼士大夫，但卧室的门上了锁，大夫没法看他。那天晚上很潮湿，早晨我在花园里走，注意到那卧室的窗户是大开着的。</p>
<p>“如果他在床上一定会被打得很湿，”我想，“床离窗户很近。我要去看看。”我找到了能开那把锁的另一把钥匙，打开门。希斯克利夫先生在床上仰面躺着，他的双眼瞪着我，热切而激动，似乎是在微笑！他的脸和衣裳被雨打湿了，他没有动弹。我意识到他是死了！</p>
<p>我关上窗，为他梳理了额头长长的黑发。我试着帮他闭上眼睛，可它们不肯阖上。突然间我很害怕，喊叫起约瑟夫来。那老仆人马上就来了，但不肯动遗体。</p>
<p>“啊，魔鬼取走了他的灵魂！我警告过他会这样的！”他叫道，“你看他有多邪恶，死的时候还笑！谢天谢地，哈里顿&middot;欧肖现在将拥有这房子和土地，他本应从他父亲那儿就继承到的！”他跪下开始祈祷。</p>
<p>实际上只有哈里顿对希斯克利夫的死感到难过。他和我参加了下葬。如他自己所愿，希斯克利夫被埋在凯瑟琳的墓旁。因为我们不知道他确切年龄或其他情况，所以墓碑上只有一个字——希斯克利夫。村里人很害怕他的鬼魂，他们说他经常在教堂墓地和荒原上游荡。</p>
<p>哈里顿和凯茜将在元旦那天结婚，然后他们搬到画眉山庄去。我将给他们做管家。约瑟夫看管呼啸山庄，但大多数房间都不会再使用了。</p>
<p>您回画眉山庄的路上会经过教堂墓地，洛克伍德先生，您可以看见靠近荒原的三个墓碑。中间凯瑟琳的已经旧了，被周围生长的杂草掩住了一半。一边是艾加&middot;林顿的，另一边是希斯克利夫的新墓碑。如果您在那儿呆一会儿，看着在温暖夏日的空气里纷飞的昆虫，听着在草丛中喘息的柔风，您就会知道在静谧的泥土下，长眠的人在多么平静地安息。</p></body></html>
