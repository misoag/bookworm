<p><b>15 圈 套 </b></p>
<p>1800 A few days after the master had forbidden Cathy to visit Linton，he asked my opinion of the boy．</p>
<p>1800年。就在主人不准凯茜去看林顿过后几天，他问我对那个小伙子有什么看法。</p>
<p>‘Tell me honestly，Ellen，what do you think of his character？’</p>
<p>“跟我说实话，艾伦，你觉得他品行怎么样？”</p>
<p>‘Well，sir，I don't think he's wicked，like his father．But you'll have plenty of time to get to know him，sir．He's too young to marry yet．’</p>
<p>“嗯，先生，我觉得他不恶毒，不像他父亲。可是要了解他，您得花很多功夫，先生。他太小，还不能结婚。”</p>
<p>Mr Edgar walked to the window and looked out．It was a misty February evening，but the churchyard was just visible．</p>
<p>艾加先生走到窗前，朝外望去。那是一个雾濛濛的2月的夜晚，刚刚能看到教堂墓地。</p>
<p>‘I've often prayed for death，Ellen．I've been very happy with my little Cathy．But I've been just as happy lying，through the long June evenings，on her mother's grave，and looking forward to the moment when I can join Catherine there！I haven't got much time left，Ellen．What can I do for Cathy before I die？Should she marry Linton？I wouldn't mind him being Heathcliff's son，if only he loved her and could be a good husband to her．’</p>
<p>“我常盼着死去，艾伦。有我的小凯茜，我非常幸福。但在那6月的漫漫长夜里我躺在她母亲的坟冢上，期望着能在另一个世界与她重逢的时候，我也同样欣慰！我剩下的时间不多了，艾伦。我死之前能为凯茜做些什么呢？她该嫁给林顿吗？只要他爱她，能做个好丈夫，我不会在乎他是希斯克利夫的儿子。”</p>
<p>‘God will show us what to do，sir，’I replied．</p>
<p>“上帝会教我们怎么做的，先生，”我回答。</p>
<p>In the spring Mr Edgar was still ill，and he continued to worry about Cathy's future．One day he wrote to Linton inviting him to visit the Grange．Linton wrote a long letter back，explaining that his father would not allow him to do that．He begged his uncle to let him meet Cathy for a walk or a ride on the moors between the Grange and Wuthering Heights，as they could not meet in either house．Mr Edgar refused at first，and Linton sent him several more letters．I am sure they had all been carefully checked by Heathcliff before they were posted．</p>
<p>到了春天艾加先生的病情依旧，他还在为凯茜的前程担忧。有一天，他写信给林顿请他来画眉山庄作客。林顿回了一封长信，解释说他父亲不许他来。他恳求舅舅让他见凯茜一面，到画眉山庄和呼啸山庄之间的荒原上去散步或者骑马，因为他们在哪个家里都不能会面。艾加先生开始不同意，接着林顿又给他写了几封信。我肯定那些信在寄出前都经希斯克利夫仔细审查过。</p>
<p>Finally Mr Edgar agreed．He hoped that，if Cathy married Linton，who would inherit the Linton fortune，she would at least be able to remain in her family home．He had no idea that Linton was seriously ill．Neither did I．I never imagined that a father could treat a dying child as cruelly and wickedly as we later discovered Heathcliff had done．</p>
<p>最终艾加先生同意了。他希望如果凯茜嫁给林顿（他将继承林顿家的财产），那她至少还能住在她自己家的房子里。他不知道林顿已重病缠身，我也不知道。我怎么也想不到一个父亲能那么无情、狠毒地对待一个垂死的孩子，这是我们后来才发现的。</p>
<p>It was a hot，sunny day in summer when Cathy and I rode out to meet her cousin．We were both shocked to discover that he could neither ride nor walk，and was lying on the grass，waiting for us．He looked even paler and weaker than the last time I had seen him．During our meeting he did not seem interested in Cathy or her news．Cathy noticed this immediately．</p>
<p>在一个炎热、阳光明媚的夏日，凯茜和我策马去见她表弟。看见他既不能骑马又不能走路，而是躺在草地上等着我们，我们都大吃一惊。他比上次我见到他时脸色更苍白、身体更虚弱。我们在一起的时候他好像对凯茜和凯茜说的事都不感兴趣。凯茜当时就看出来了。</p>
<p>‘Well，Linton，'she said after a while，‘you don't want to talk to me，so I think I'll go home．’</p>
<p>“那好，林顿，”她停了一会儿说道，“你不想和我说话，那我想我还是回家吧。”</p>
<p>‘No，no！’he cried，getting quite excited．‘Not yet！Stay—at least another half-hour！My father will be angry with me if you leave early！’</p>
<p>“不，别走！”他叫起来，有些激动。“先别走！留在这儿——至少再呆半个钟头！如果你早走了，我父亲会对我发火的！”</p>
<p>‘I suppose we can stay a few minutes longer，'said Cathy．</p>
<p>“我想我们还能再呆几分钟，”凯茜说。</p>
<p>We waited，talking to each other quietly while Linton slept a little．Sometimes he cried out in pain． ‘Do you think his health is better now than before？’whispered Cathy．</p>
<p>林顿小睡了一会儿，我们边等边小声说着话。有时他疼得叫出声。“你觉得他的身体比以前好些了吗？”凯茜低声说。</p>
<p>‘I'm sorry，Miss Cathy，I think it's much worse，’I answered．</p>
<p>“对不起，凯茜小姐，我觉得大不如从前，”我回答。</p>
<p>Cathy called her pony，and the sound woke Linton up．</p>
<p>凯茜唤了一声她的小马，声音把林顿弄醒了。</p>
<p>‘If you see my father，’he said，hesitating，‘could you tell him I've been cheerful？He'll be here soon！’And he looked round in terror．</p>
<p>“如果你见到我父亲，”他犹犹豫豫地说道，“你能不能跟他说我挺高兴的？他马上就会来了！”说罢惊恐地往四下看了看。</p>
<p>‘I'll be here next Thursday！’cried Cathy，as she jumped on her pony．‘Come on，Ellen！’</p>
<p>“我下礼拜四来！”凯茜大声说，一边跳上马。“走罢，艾伦！”</p>
<p>In the week that followed，Mr Edgar's illness grew worse every day．Cathy could not avoid realizing how serious it was，and sat by his bedside day and night，looking sad and pale．Her father's room had become her whole world．On Thursday I thought a ride in the fresh air would be good for her，and Mr Edgar gladly gave her permission to see Linton．He was hoping that she would not be left alone after his death．I did not want to worry him in his last moments，so I did not tell him that Linton was also dying．</p>
<p>在此后的一周里，艾加先生的病日渐恶化。尽管很不情愿，凯茜还是意识到了病情严重性，于是不分昼夜地守在他的床前，她愁眉不展，气色很差。她成天只在父亲的房间呆着。到了礼拜四，我琢磨骑马透透新鲜空气会对她有好处，而且艾加先生很高兴地允许她去看林顿。他希望死后不至于把她孤孤单单地撇下。我不想让他在最后的日子有什么放心不下的，所以没告诉他林顿也在撒谎。</p>
<p>We rode on to the moors and found Linton lying in the same place as before．He was looking very frightened．</p>
<p>我们骑着马上了荒原，看到林顿还像上次一样躺在同一个地方，面带惊惧之色。</p>
<p>‘I thought you weren't going to come！’he said．</p>
<p>“我以为你不来了呢！”他说。</p>
<p>‘Why won't you be honest？’cried Cathy at once．‘Why have you brought me here again，if you don't want to see me？My father's very ill and I should be with him．’</p>
<p>“你为什么不说实话？”凯茜顿时哭了，“要是你不愿见我，为什么还要把我叫来？我父亲的病很重，我应该陪着他。”</p>
<p>Tears rolled down Linton's face．He seemed terrified．</p>
<p>眼泪顺着林顿的面庞往下淌，像是很害怕的样子。</p>
<p>‘Oh，I can't bear it！’he sobbed．‘Cathy，I daren't explain！But if you leave me，he'll kill me！Dear Cathy，my life is in your hands！Kind，sweet Cathy，perhaps you will agree，and then he won't hurt me！’</p>
<p>“噢，我受不了啦！”他呜咽道。“凯茜，我不敢说！可要是你离开我，他会杀了我的！亲爱的凯茜，我的命攥在你的手里！善良、可爱的凯茜，你或许会答应，这样他就不会折磨我了！”</p>
<p>Cathy was no longer impatient．‘Agree to what，Linton？'she asked gently．‘Tell me everything！You wouldn't do anything to hurt me，would you，Linton？I'm your best friend．’</p>
<p>凯茜不再那么不耐烦。“答应什么，林顿？”她轻声问，“全都告诉我！你不会做伤害我的事，对么，林顿？我是你最好的朋友。”</p>
<p>‘I daren't tell you！My father—'the boy gasped．Just then Heathcliff appeared．He did not look at Cathy and Linton，who continued talking to each other，but he spoke quietly to me．</p>
<p>“我不敢告诉你！我父亲——”这孩子喘了口气。就在这时希斯克利夫出现了。他没看凯茜和林顿，他们还在接着说话，他悄悄地对我说。</p>
<p>‘Ellen，how is Edgar？Is he dying，as the villagers say？’</p>
<p>“艾伦，艾加怎么样啦？他是快死了吗？村里的人是这么讲的。”</p>
<p>‘It's true，the master is dying，’I answered．</p>
<p>“是的，老爷将不久于人世了，”我回答。</p>
<p>‘That boy over there is dying too．I only hope Edgar dies before him．If Linton dies first，my plan will fail．’He shouted angrily to his son，‘Get up，Linton！’and then said politely to Cathy，‘Miss Cathy，would you help him back to the house．He can't walk far alone．’</p>
<p>“那孩子也快要死了。我只希望艾加死在他前面。要是林顿先死，我的计划就落空了。”他向儿子怒斥道，“起来，林顿！”然后又彬彬有礼地对凯茜说，“凯茜小姐，你能扶他回家去吗。他一个人走不了太远的路。”</p>
<p>‘Father has forbidden me to enter your house，'said Cathy．</p>
<p>“父亲不让我进你们家的宅子，”凯茜说。</p>
<p>‘Well，come along，Linton．I'll have to take you home then，'said Heathcliff．</p>
<p>“好罢，走，林顿。那我来带你回家。”希斯克利夫说。</p>
<p>‘No！No！No！Please，Cathy！You must come with me！'screamed Linton wildly．He held desperately on to her arm．</p>
<p>“不！不！不！求你啦，凯茜！你一定要跟我来！”林顿大叫起来。他没命地抱着凯茜的胳膊。</p>
<p>Cathy could not refuse the boy，who seemed almost mad with fear．So we all walked the few steps to Wuthering Heights．When we had entered the house，however，I was horrified to see Heathcliff lock the front door．The key was in his hand．</p>
<p>凯茜无法拒绝他，他好像是吓得快发疯了。于是我们一起走这几步到了呼啸山庄。可当我们一进屋，我吃惊地看到希斯克利夫把前门锁上了。钥匙在他手里。</p>
<p>‘Hareton，Joseph and Zillah are all out of the house，’he said calmly，‘so we are quite alone．’</p>
<p>‘哈里顿约瑟夫，齐拉都不在屋，’他平静地说，‘所以只有我们自己。’</p>
<p>‘Give me that key！’cried Cathy angrily．‘I'm not afraid of you！’She took hold of his closed hand and bit it．He hit her violently several times，on both sides of the head，and she fell into a chair，trembling．I rushed at him，but he pushed me away．</p>
<p>“把钥匙给我！”凯茜愤怒地喊道。“我不怕你！”她抓住他攥着的手咬了一口。他使劲打了她头两侧几下，她倒在了椅子里，浑身颤抖着。我朝他冲过去，但他把我推开了。</p>
<p>‘Cry as much as you like，Miss Cathy，’he said．‘In a few days I'll be your father，and I'll punish you just like that，as often as necessary！’</p>
<p>“你愿意怎么哭就怎么哭，凯茜小姐。”他说，“过不了几天我就是你父亲啦，只要需要，我会就这样教训你！”</p>
<p>When Heathcliff went out to look for our horses，Cathy and I hurried round the kitchen looking for a way to escape．But all the doors and windows were locked．Linton was sitting calmly in a chair near the fire，happy that he was not being punished this time．We persuaded him to explain his father's plan to us．</p>
<p>希斯克利夫出去找我们的马的时候，凯茜和我忙在在厨房里找逃路。但所有的门和窗户都上了锁。林顿在炉火旁的椅子里安然地坐着，很高兴他这次没受到惩罚。我们劝说他把他父亲的计划告诉我们。</p>
<p>‘Father is afraid I'll die soon，you see，so he wants us to be married tomorrow morning．You'll have to stay here all night，Cathy．Then perhaps he'll let you go home in the morning．’</p>
<p>“父亲怕我很快就要死了，你知道，所以他想让我们明天上午结婚。你一整夜都要在这儿呆着了，凯茜。上午他可能就让你回家。”</p>
<p>‘You marry this beautiful，healthy young lady？’I cried．‘You must be mad！And wicked too！You and your father have tricked us into coming here！’And I shook him until he started coughing．</p>
<p>“你和这个漂亮、健康的年轻小姐结婚？”我叫道。“你一定疯了！而且恶毒！你和你父亲用计把我们骗到这儿！”我晃着他，直到他开始咳嗽为止。</p>
<p>‘I must go home now．Father will be worried already，'said Cathy．‘I love Father better than you，Linton！’</p>
<p>“我现在必须回家。父亲肯定已经担心了，”凯茜说。“我爱我父亲胜过爱你，林顿！”</p>
<p>Heathcliff returned and sent his son upstairs to bed．</p>
<p>希斯克利夫回来后把儿子送到楼上的床上。</p>
<p>‘Mr Heathcliff，’begged Cathy，‘Father will be miserable if I don't go home．Please let me go．I promise to marry Linton．Father would like it，and I love him．Why do you force me to do something I want to do？’</p>
<p>“希斯克利夫先生，”凯茜哀求道，“要是我不回家，父亲会很难过的。求您让我走吧。我答应嫁给林顿。父亲会喜欢这样的，我爱他。你为什么要逼着我做我原本愿意的事？”</p>
<p>‘He can't force you！’I cried．‘I'll go to the police！’</p>
<p>“他不能强迫你！”我叫道。“我要去找警察！”</p>
<p>‘To the devil with you，Ellen！Miss Cathy，I'm delighted that your father will be miserable．In that case you will certainly stay here for twenty-four hours．You won't leave here until you've kept your promise to marry Linton．’</p>
<p>“见你的鬼去罢，艾伦！凯茜小姐，你父亲难过我很开心。要是这样，你自然要在这儿呆24小时。你得实现要嫁给林顿的诺言，否则别想离开这儿。”</p>
<p>‘Please send Ellen to let Father know I'm safe！'sobbed Cathy bitterly．‘Poor Father！He'll think we're lost！’</p>
<p>“请让艾伦去给我父亲报个平安！”凯茜泣不成声。“可怜的父亲！他会以为我们迷路了！”</p>
<p>‘Your father must have hated you when you came into the world（I did，at least），and he'll hate you as he leaves it．Go on crying．That's what you'll be doing when you're Linton's wife．He'll make a cruel，selfish husband，I think．’</p>
<p>“你来到这世上时你父亲一定恨你（至少我是这样），而在他离开这世上时他还会恨你。接着哭吧。你当了林顿的妻子就只能以泪洗面了。我想必他会是个无情、自私的丈夫。”</p>
<p>Heathcliff took us upstairs to Zillah's room，where we spent the night，locked in．Neither of us could sleep．At seven the following morning he came to fetch Cathy，and took her away．From that moment I saw nobody except Hareton，who brought me food，for four whole days and nights．</p>
<p>希斯克利夫把我们弄到楼上齐拉的房间里，被锁在里面过了一夜。我们俩都睡不着。第二天早晨7点他来找凯茜，把她带走了。在此之后整整四个昼夜里，除了哈里顿来给我送吃的，我就谁的面也没见到了。</p>
<p>On the fifth morning Zillah came into the room．She was surprised and pleased to see me，and told me the villagers all thought Cathy and I had got lost on the moors，and died，four days ago．I ran out of the room to look for Cathy．</p>
<p>第五天的早晨齐拉来到了房间。她见到我很吃惊，也很高兴，告诉我村里人都以为凯茜和我四天前就在荒原上迷路死了。我跑出房间去找凯茜。</p>
<p>The big kitchen was full of sunshine，and the door was open，but the only person there was Linton．</p>
<p>大厨房里洒满了阳光，门是开着的，但只有林顿一个人在。</p>
<p>‘Where is she？Where is Miss Cathy？’I cried wildly．</p>
<p>“她在哪儿？凯茜小姐在哪儿？”我厉声问道。</p>
<p>‘Upstairs，in a locked room，’he replied calmly，eating a piece of sugar．‘We won't let her go yet．Father says I shouldn't he soft with Cathy．We've had the wedding ceremony，so she's my wife now，and must stay with me．I don't care if she cries，or is ill！’</p>
<p>“楼上，锁在房间里，”他不动声色地答道，正吃着一块糖。“我们还不能放她走。父亲说我对凯茜不能手软。我们已经举行了婚礼，所以她现在是我妻子，得和我在一起。我不在乎她哭不哭、病不病！”</p>
<p>‘Have you forgotten her kindness to you last winter，when you wrote that you loved her，and she used to come through wind and snow to see you？Now you believe your father's lies about her！And you leave her alone，ill and crying in a strange house！You pity yourself，but you won't pity her！What a heartless，selfish boy you are！’</p>
<p>“你忘了她去年冬天对你多好，你写信给她说你爱她，她顶风冒雪来看你？如今你听信了你父亲说她的鬼话！你把她孤独地撇在一旁，任她在一个陌生的房子里生并痛苦！你可怜自己，却不肯可怜她！你真是个没心没肺、自私的小子！”</p>
<p>‘I can't stay with her！She cries so much I can't bear it！I can't sleep with all that noise．She promised that if I gave her the key to our room，she’d give me all her nice books，and her pony，but I told her she had nothing to give．They're all mine，or they'll belong to me very soon．And then she cried，and took a little gold case from around her neck．Inside were two pictures，one of her mother and one of her father．I wanted to take them both from her，but she wouldn't let me，so I screamed for help．My father came，and ordered her to give him the pictures and the case．When she refused，he—he hit her on the face and knocked her down，and broke the gold case under his foot．He took away the picture of her mother．’</p>
<p>“我无法和她呆在一起！她没命地哭，我受不了！吵得我睡不着。她答应要是我把我们房间的钥匙给她，她就把她所有的书还有小马给我，但我告诉她说她没有什么东西可给我的啦。它们已经是我的了，或者说很快就会属于我。然后她哭了起来，从脖子上拿下一个小金框。里面有两张肖像，一张是她母亲，另一张是她父亲。我想把它们都从她手里拿过来，可她不肯，所以我就大叫起来。我父亲来了，命令她把画像和金框都交给他。她不肯，他——他就扇了她一记耳光，把她打倒在地，用脚踩坏了金框。他把她母亲的肖像拿走了。”</p>
<p>‘And were you pleased to see Miss Cathy hurt？’I asked．</p>
<p>“看到凯茜小姐受虐待你挺开心吧？”我问。</p>
<p>‘My father was right to punish her．But I didn't like seeing her mouth full of blood．She can't speak because of the pain．Now you've made me tired with all this talking！You won't find the key to the room！Go away！’</p>
<p>“我父亲惩罚她没错。但我不喜欢看她满嘴是血的样子。她疼得说不出话来。你让我说了这么多话我都累了！你找不到房间钥匙的！走开！”</p>
<p>As there seemed to be no chance of persuading him to help her escape，I decided to go back to the Grange as quickly as possible，and rescue her later．</p>
<p>看来要劝说他帮凯茜逃走是没什么指望了，我决定尽快赶回画眉山庄，过后再救她。</p>
<p>What a welcome I received from the servants at the Grange，who thought I was dead！But I did not have time to tell them my story．I went straight to my master's room．He was lying in bed，very weak and close to death．I told him how Heathcliff had trapped us，and that Cathy was probably mar ried to Linton by now．Mr Edgar realized that his enemy wanted to get hold of the Linton fortune，through his son．He asked me to send for his lawyer，to make arrangements so that Cathy would not lose all her inheritance．</p>
<p>回到画眉山庄，我受到仆人们的热情迎接，他们都以为我死了！但我没时间跟他们讲原委。我径直去了主人的房间。他躺在床上，极度虚弱，快要不行了。我告诉他希斯克利夫是如何骗我们入了圈套，还有凯茜很可能已嫁给了林顿。艾加先生明白过来他的仇敌是想通过他的儿子来抢夺自己的财产。他叫我去找他的律师，做好安排使凯茜不至于失去全部的继承权。</p>
<p>I did as he asked，but the lawyer sent a message，saying that he could not come until the next day．I also sent four strong men with weapons to Wuthering Heights，to demand my young lady's freedom．I was very angry when they returned without her，because Heathcliff had sent them away．</p>
<p>我照他说的做了，可律师捎信来说第二天才能来。我还派了四个壮汉带着武器到呼啸山庄去解救我家小姐。他们空手而归，我很生气，因为希斯克利夫把他们赶了回来。</p>
<p>But I needn't have worried．In the middle of the night，as I was taking some water to the master，I heard a knock on the front door，and went to open it．It was my little mistress！</p>
<p>可不该我担心。当天深夜，我正去给主人送水，听见前门有敲门声就去开门。正是我家宝贝小姐！</p>
<p>‘Ellen，Ellen！'she sobbed．‘Is Father still alive？’</p>
<p>“艾伦，艾伦！”她呜咽着。“父亲还活着吗？”</p>
<p>‘Yes，’I cried，‘and thank God you're safe with us again！’</p>
<p>“是的，”我哭了，“感谢上帝你又平平安安地回到了我们身边！”</p>
<p>‘I managed to make Linton help me escape from the room！Now I must see Father！’</p>
<p>“我想法儿让林顿帮我逃出了那房间！现在我得见父亲！”</p>
<p>I could not bear to be present at their meeting．I waited outside the bedroom door．But they were both calm．Cathy's despair was as silent as her father's happiness．He died in perfect peace，Mr Lockwood．Kissing her，he whispered，‘I'm going to join her，and you，dear child，will join us！’He did not move or speak again．</p>
<p>他们会面时我不忍在常我在卧室门外等着。但他们俩都很平静。凯茜的绝望和她父亲的欣慰都在沉默中表达了。他是非常安祥地死去的，洛克伍德先生。他亲着她，微弱地说，“我要去见她了，而你，亲爱的孩子，也会和我们团聚的！”他再也没有动、没有说话。</p>
<p>Cathy did not cry，but sat silently by his dead body all morning．At lunch-time the lawyer arrived，too late to help Cathy．Heathcliff had bribed him to stay away．He gave us Heathcliff's orders．All the servants except me had to leave．Cathy，Mrs Heathcliff now，was only allowed to stay at the Grange until her father was buried．</p>
<p>凯茜没哭，但整个上午都在他的遗体旁默默地坐着。午饭时律师来了，太晚了，已帮不了凯茜。希斯克利夫贿赂了他要他别管这事，他传达了希斯克利夫的指令。除我之外，所有的仆人都被遣走了。只允许凯茜，现在是希斯克利夫夫人，在她父亲下葬前住在画眉山庄。</p><a href='16.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
