<p><b>12 凯茜长大了 </b></p>
<p>1797 During the next twelve years I was happier than I had ever been before．All my time was spent looking after little Cathy，who brought sunshine into our lives．She was a real beauty，with the Earnshaws’ dark eyes and the Lintons’fair skin．She wasn't as proud and quick-tempered as her mother，but she was used to getting what she wanted． Her father loved her so much that he gave her everything，and never scolded her．</p>
<p>1797年。在以后的12年里，我比以前任何时候都过得舒心。我所有的时间都花在照看小凯茜身上，她给我们的生活带来了阳光。她是一个不折不扣的小美人，长着欧肖家的黑眼睛，林顿家的白皮肤。她不像她母亲那样孤傲和脾气暴躁，但也是习惯了要什么有什么。她的父亲对她非常宠爱，什么都给她，也从不责骂。</p>
<p>Until she was thirteen she had never been outside the Grange garden alone．She knew nothing of Wuthering Heights or Heathcliff．She often asked me about the hills in the distance，beyond the moors，and wanted to ride her pony there．I knew the master would not let her leave the safety of the Grange to go so far，especially as the road to the hills passed close to Wuthering Heights．So I always told her she would be able to go there when she was older．I did not know what she was planning．</p>
<p>她13岁之前从未单独出过画眉山庄的门。她对呼啸山庄和希斯克利夫的事一无所知。她常问我远处荒原那边的山丘是什么样的，想骑着她的小马到那儿去。我知道主人不会让她离开画眉山庄的庇护，跑到那么远的地方，尤其是通向山丘的路离呼啸山庄很近。所以我总是告诉她等她长大些才能去。我不知道她是怎么打算的。</p>
<p>Mr Edgar received a letter from his sister Isabella．She wrote that she was dying of a fever，and asked him to visit her for the first and last time．She also wanted him to take care of her son Linton after her death．Although my master hated travelling，he did not hesitate to do as she requested．He told me to look after Cathy carefully，and left at once．</p>
<p>艾加先生收到一封她妹妹伊莎贝拉来的信。她在信中说她患了热病，将不久于人世，头一次、也是最后一次请求他去看望她。她还想托付他在她死后照顾她的儿子林顿。尽管我的主人实在不愿出门，可他还是毫不犹豫地依了她。他嘱咐我小心看管凯茜，然后就上路了。</p>
<p>He was away for three weeks．Cathy did not cause me any trouble at first．She spent her days walking her dogs and riding her pony in the large garden．But one day she asked if she could stay out the whole day，and away she went on her little pony，with her two dogs running behind．</p>
<p>他走了三个星期。开始凯茜没给我添什么麻烦。她整天在大花园里溜狗，骑她的小马。但有一天她问能不能到外面呆一整天，然后骑上她的小马，后面跟着两条狗就走了。</p>
<p>There was no sign of her at tea-time，and I began to be seriously worried．I went outside to look for her．At the gate I found a workman，who had seen-her jump the low wall separating the garden from the road，and then ride on towards the hills and Wuthering Heights．</p>
<p>到了吃茶点的时候还没见她的人影，我开始真的担心起来。我到外面找她。我在大门前碰到一个佣工，他曾看见她跳过花园和路之间的矮墙，骑着马朝山丘和呼啸山庄的方向去了。</p>
<p>I was very frightened now．She could be lost on the moors！ She could have tried to climb the hills，and fallen！I walked across the moors as fast as I could，and arrived breathless at Wuthering Heights．How glad I was to see one of her dogs lying outside the kitchen door！I knocked loudly，and Zillah let me in．I knew she had been the housekeeper there since Hindley's death． ‘Ah，'she said，‘you've come for your little mistress！She's here，quite safe！The master，Mr Heathcliff，isn't here．He won't be back for a while．’</p>
<p>这时我吓坏了。她可能在荒原里迷了路！她可能试图爬山时摔了下来！我以最快的速度走过荒原，上气不接下气地赶到呼啸山庄。当看到厨房的门前躺着凯茜的一条狗，我真是如释重负！我大声敲门，齐拉把我让了进去。我知道亨德雷死后她就成了这儿的女管家。“哦，”她说，“你是来找你家小姐的！她在这儿，平安无事！主人希斯克利夫先生不在家。他一时还回不来。”</p>
<p>Cathy was sitting comfortably in the kitchen，talking eagerly to Hareton．He was now a big，strong young man of eighteen，who was staring rather stupidly at her．I was delighted to find her again，but I pretended to be angry to punish her． ‘Well，miss！You are wicked，going such a long way all alone！I've been all over the moors looking for you！looking father will be angry！’</p>
<p>凯茜舒舒服服地坐在厨房里，跟哈里顿兴致勃勃地说着话。他已是个18岁的小伙子，长得高大强壮，正傻呆呆地盯着她看。我很高兴找到了她，但我还是作出生气要惩戒她的样子。“好啊，小姐！你真是够野的，一个人跑了这么远！我到荒原找遍了你！你父亲会生气的！”</p>
<p>‘What have I done？'she sobbed，suddenly frightened． ‘Father didn't forbid me to leave the Grange garden！He won't scold me，Ellen．He's never cross，like you！And I've been to the hills，Ellen！This-man-showed me，because I didn't know the way．’</p>
<p>“我怎么啦？”她呜咽起来，忽然觉得有点害怕。“父亲并不禁止我离开画眉山庄！他不会骂我的，艾伦。他从不发怒，像你！我去了山上，艾伦！是这个——人——给我指的路，因为我不认识。”</p>
<p>I made her put on her hat and prepare to leave． ‘Whose house is this？'she asked suddenly．‘It's your father's，isn't it？'she added，turming to Hareton． ‘No，’he replied，looking down．His face went very red．</p>
<p>我叫她戴上帽子，准备告辞。“这是谁的房子？”她冷不丁地问道。“是你父亲的，是吗？”她转向哈里顿，加了一句。“不，”他回答，眼睛看着下面，脸变得通红。</p>
<p>‘Whose then-your master's？'she asked．</p>
<p>“那是谁的——你主人的？”她问。</p>
<p>He swore，and turned away． “Ellen，he didn't say miss to me．Servants should always say ‘miss’，shouldn't they？”</p>
<p>他骂了一句，转过身去。“艾伦，他没叫我‘小姐’。仆人该永远称‘小姐’，对么？”</p>
<p>Hareton frowned and looked very angry，but said nothing． ‘You，get my horse，'she ordered him ‘Hurry！’ ‘What the devil do you mean？I'm not your servant！’he growled．</p>
<p>哈里顿眉头一皱，看上去很恼怒，但没说话。“你，给我备马，”她命令道。“快点！”“你他妈的什么意思？我不是你的仆人！”他怒吼道。</p>
<p>‘You see，Miss Cathy？Nice words to be used to a young lady！Now come along，let's fetch the pony and leave，’I said． ‘But Ellen，'she cried，staring horrified at him，‘how dare he speak to me like that！He must do as I tell him！’</p>
<p>“你知道了，凯茜小姐，对一个年轻的小姐就用这种文雅的语言！跟我走吧，我们牵上小马离开吧，”我说。“可艾伦，”她嚷道，反感地瞪着他，“他怎敢那样对我说话！他得照我吩咐的去做！”</p>
<p>He's not your servant，miss，'said Zillah，who had been listening to the conversation．‘He's your cousin．’ ‘He can't be my cousin！’cried Cathy，with a scornful laugh．‘Father has gone to fetch my cousin from London．He's a gentleman's son，not-not a farm worker like him！’She pointed at poor Hareton，whose clothes were old and dirty．</p>
<p>“他不是你的仆人，小姐，”齐拉说道，她一直在听着他们的对话，“他是你表哥。”“他不可能是我的表哥！”凯茜讥笑着喊道。“父亲到伦敦去接我表弟去了。他是个有教养人家的公子，不是——不是像他这样一个农庄里干活儿的！”她指着衣衫破旧邋遢、可怜巴巴的哈里顿。</p>
<p>I was very annoyed with her and Zillah．Now Heathcliff would hear about his son's arrival，which we had hoped to keep secret from him．And Cathy would certainly ask her father whether she had a cousin at Wuthering Heights．On our way home I explained to her that if her father discovered she had visited Wuthering Heights，he would perhaps be so angry with me that he would send me away．She could not bear to think of that，so she promised to keep her visit a secret from him．</p>
<p>她和齐拉让我很气恼。这样希斯克利夫就会听到他儿子回来的消息，我们本打算不让他知道的。而且凯茜也肯定会问父亲她是不是有个表哥在呼啸山庄。在回去的路上，我对她解释说要是她父亲得知她去了呼肃山庄，会对我很生气，有可能会把我赶走。她不愿想像这种结果，所以答应不让父亲知道她来呼啸山庄的事。</p>
<p>We heard from Mr Edgar that his sister had died，and that he was returning soon with his young nephew．Cathy was wild with excitement．She would see her dear father again，and have a cousin of the same age to play with．</p>
<p>我们收到艾加先生信说他妹妹已经去世了，他很快就带着他的小侄子回来。凯茜欣喜若狂。她又能见到父亲了，而且还将有一个同龄的表弟和她一起玩。</p>
<p>But when the coach arrived，young Linton had to be carried into the house．He was a pale，thin boy，who looked very like Mr Edgar．He seemed so weak that I wondered how long he would live．I thought he would have no chance of life if his father Heathcliff took him to live at Wuthering Heights．</p>
<p>可当马车到来的时候，小林顿是被抱着进的房子。他是个皮肤苍白、身体瘦弱的少年，样子很像艾加先生。他看上去很虚弱，我不禁怀疑他还能活多久。我想如果他父亲希斯克利夫把他带到呼啸山庄去住的话，他就根本没有活下去的机会。</p>
<p>In fact Linton only stayed one night with us．Later that evening Heathcliff's servant Joseph arrived and asked to speak to the master．Although it was late and Mr Edgar was tired after his journey，Joseph insisted，so I took him to the master's room． ‘Heathcliff has sent me for his son，and I can't go back without him，’he said．</p>
<p>其实林顿只同我们一起住了一夜。当天晚上希斯克利夫的仆人约瑟夫来了，想求见主人，有话要说。虽然已经很晚，艾加先生长途跋涉也很疲惫，可约瑟夫执意要见，于是我就把他领到主人的房间。“希斯克利夫派我来接他的儿子，不带上他我不能回去，”他说。</p>
<p>Mr Edgar was silent for a moment．On his face was an expression of deep sadness．He had hoped to keep Linton with him，as Isabella had wished．But he could not refuse the boy's father． ‘Tell Mr Heathcliff，’he said calmly，‘that Ellen will take his son to Wuthering Heights tomorrow．He‘s asleep at the moment，and I won't disturb him．’</p>
<p>艾加先生好一会儿没做声。满面愁容。他本来希望按伊莎贝拉的遗愿把林顿留在他身边。可他无法挡得住他父亲。“转告希斯克利夫先生，”他平静地说，“艾伦明天会把他儿子送到呼啸山庄。他现在已经睡了，我不愿叫醒他。”</p>
<p>‘No！'said Joseph，banging the table with his hand．‘I must take him back now！’</p>
<p>“不行！”约瑟夫手拍着桌子说道，“我现在必须把他带回去！”</p>
<p>‘Not tonight！’answered Mr Edgar．‘Leave the house now，and tell your master what I said！’ ‘Very well！'shouted Joseph，as he walked out．‘If he doesn't arrive early in the morning，Heathcliff will come for him！’</p>
<p>“今天晚上不行！”艾加先生回答，“马上离开这座房子，把我的话告诉你的主人！”“好极了！”约瑟夫往外走的时候叫嚷道。“要是他明天一大早没到，希斯克利夫会来接他的！”</p><a href='13.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
