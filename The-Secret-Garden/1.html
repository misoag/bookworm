<p><b>1 幼年的玛丽小姐 </b></p>
<p>Nobody seemed to care about Mary．She was born in India，where her father was a British official．He was busy with his work，and her mother，who was very beautiful， spent all her time going to parties．So an Indian woman，Kamala，was paid to take care of the little girl．Mary was not a pretty child．She had a thin angry face and thin yellow hair． She was always giving orders to Kamala，who had to obey． Mary never thought of other people， but only of herself．In fact，she was a very selfish，disagreeable，bad-tempered little girl．</p>
<p>似乎没有人注意玛丽的存在。玛丽出生在印度，父亲是驻印的英国官员，总是忙着工作，母亲长得非常漂亮，把所有时间都花在参加聚会上。所以，一个名叫卡玛拉的印度女人被雇来照看这个小姑娘。玛丽长得不漂亮，消瘦的脸上总是一副生气的样子，头发稀疏枯黄。她总对卡玛拉发号施令，卡玛拉只好顺从她。她很少想到别人，只顾自己。她确实是一个非常自私，脾气怪戾，很难相处的女孩。</p>
<p>One very hot morning，when she was about nine years old， she woke up and saw that instead of Kamala there was a different Indian servant by her bed．</p>
<p>在她9岁那年的一个上午，天气很热，她醒来时发现站在床前的不是卡玛拉，而是另外一个印度女仆。</p>
<p>‘What are you doing here？’she asked crossly．‘Go away！ And send Kamala to me at once！’</p>
<p>“你在这儿干什么？”她生气地问。“走开！叫卡玛拉马上到这儿来！”</p>
<p>The woman looked afraid．‘I'm sorry，Miss Mary，she— she—she can't come！’</p>
<p>那个女人看来很害怕。“对不起，玛丽小姐，她——她——她来不了了！”</p>
<p>Something strange was happening that day．Some of the house servants were missing and everybody looked frightened． But nobody told Mary anything，and Kamala still did not come．So at last Mary went out into the garden，and played by herself under a tree．She pretended she was making her own flower garden，and picked large red flowers to push into the ground．All the time she was saying crossly to herself，</p>
<p>那天发生了一些很奇怪的事情，房子里的一些仆人不见了，每个人看上去都惊恐异常。可是没有人告诉玛丽任何事情，卡玛拉也始终没来。最后玛丽只好一个人来到花园，在一棵树下玩耍。她假装是在给自己造一座花园，摘来大朵的红花插在土里，一边玩还一边堵气地自言自语。</p>
<p>‘I hate Kamala！I'll hit her when she comes back！’</p>
<p>“我讨厌卡玛拉！等她回来我要接她一顿！”</p>
<p>Just then she saw her mother coming into the garden，with a young Englishman．They did not notice the child，who listened to their conversation．</p>
<p>就在这会儿，她看见妈妈和一个年轻的英国人走进花园，玛丽听见了他们的谈话，他们却没注意到她。</p>
<p>‘It's very bad，is it？’her mother asked the young man in a worried voice．</p>
<p>“很严重，是吗？”妈妈问那个年轻人，声音充满焦虑。</p>
<p>‘Very bad，’he answered seriously．‘People are dying like flies．It's dangerous to stay in this town．You should go to the hills，where there's no disease．’</p>
<p>“非常严重，”他严肃地说。“人们像苍蝇一样死去，再在城里呆下去太危险了，你得到山里去，那里没有疾玻”</p>
<p>‘Oh，I know！’she cried．‘We must leave soon！’</p>
<p>“哦，我知道！”她叫道，“我们得马上离开！”</p>
<p>Suddenly they heard loud cries coming from the servants’rooms，at the side of the house．</p>
<p>突然，他们听到房子侧面用人屋里传来嚎啕大哭的声音。</p>
<p>‘What's happened？’cried Mary's mother wildly．</p>
<p>“出了什么事？”玛丽的妈妈慌乱地大叫着。</p>
<p>‘I think one of your servants has just died．You didn't tell me the disease is here，in your house！’</p>
<p>“我看是你的一个用人刚刚死去。你没告诉过我这儿也有疫病，在你的房子里！”</p>
<p>‘I didn't know！’she screamed．‘Quick，come with me！’And together they ran into the house．</p>
<p>“我根本不知道！”她尖声叫着。“快，跟我来。”他们一同冲进屋去。</p>
<p>Now Mary understood what was wrong．The terrible disease had already killed many people in the town，and in all the houses people were dying．In Mary's house it was Kamala who had just died．Later that day three more servants died there．</p>
<p>现在玛丽明白是哪儿不对了。可怕的疫病已经夺去了城里很多人的生命，到处都有人在死去。在玛丽家刚刚死去的正是卡玛拉。那天后来又有3个用人死了。</p>
<p>All through the night and the next day people ran in and out of the house，shouting and crying．Nobody thought of Mary． She hid in her bedroom，frightened by the strange and terrible sounds that she heard around her．Sometimes she cried and sometimes she slept．</p>
<p>整整一夜到第二天，人们跑进跑出，哭着，喊着，谁也没想起玛丽。她躲在卧室里，被周围这些可怕的声音吓坏了，不时地哭着，哭累了就睡上一会儿。</p>
<p>When she woke the next day，the house was silent．</p>
<p>第二天，当她醒来时，房子里一片寂静。</p>
<p>‘Perhaps the disease has gone，’she thought，‘and everybody is well again．I wonder who will take care of me instead of Kamala？Why doesn't someone bring me some food？It's strange the house is so quiet．’</p>
<p>“说不定疫病已经过去，人们又和从前一样健康了，”她想着，“谁会接替卡玛拉来照看我呢？为什么家里没人给我送点吃的来，房子里这么静，真是太奇怪了。”</p>
<p>But just then she heard men's voices in the hall．</p>
<p>就在这时，她听到客厅里男人说话的声音。</p>
<p>‘How sad！’ said one．‘That beautiful woman！’</p>
<p>“太惨啦！”有人说。“这么漂亮的女人！”</p>
<p>‘There was a child too，wasn't there？’said the other．‘Although none of us ever saw her．’</p>
<p>“还应该有个孩子的，是不是？”另外一个人说，“尽管我们都没有看见她。”</p>
<p>Mary was standing in the middle of her room when they opened the door a few minutes later．The two men jumped back in surprise．</p>
<p>几分钟后，他们推开门，玛丽站在房间的中间，两个男人吓得跳了回去。</p>
<p>‘My name is Mary Lennox，’she said crossly．‘I was asleep when everyone was ill，and now I'm hungry．’</p>
<p>“我叫玛丽&middot;莲诺丝，”她生气地说。“他们生病时我睡着了，现在我很饿。”</p>
<p>‘It's the child，the one nobody ever saw！’said the older man to the other．‘They've all forgotten her！’</p>
<p>“就是这个孩子，谁都没看见她！”年长一点的男人对另一个说。“他们都把她忘了！”</p>
<p>‘Why was I forgotten？’asked Mary angrily．‘Why has nobody come to take care of me？’</p>
<p>“为什么把我忘了？”玛丽气呼呼地问。“为什么没人来照看我？”</p>
<p>The younger man looked at her very sadly．‘Poor child！’ he said．‘You see，there's nobody left alive in the house．So nobody can come．’</p>
<p>年轻一点的男人忧伤地看着她，“可怜的孩子！”他说。“听着，这幢房子里的人全死了，所以没有人能来照看你。”</p>
<p>In this strange and sudden way Mary learnt that both her mother and her father had died．The few servants who had not died had run away in the night．No one had remembered little Miss Mary．She was all alone．</p>
<p>以这样一种奇异而突然的方式，玛丽得知她的父母已不在人世，活下来的几个用人也趁半夜逃走了。没人想起年幼的玛丽小姐，就只剩下她一个人了。</p>
<p>Because she had never known her parents well，she did not miss them at all．She only thought of herself，as she had always done．</p>
<p>由于她跟父母并不亲近，也并不想念他们。像以前一样，她只想到了她自己。</p>
<p>‘Where will I live？’she wondered．‘I hope I'll stay with people who'll let me do what I want．’</p>
<p>“我该住哪儿呢？”她思量着。“我想跟那些让我想干什么就干什么的人在一起。”</p>
<p>At first she was taken to an English family who had known her parents．She hated their untidy house and noisy children， and preferred playing by herself in the garden．One day she was playing her favourite game，pretending to make a garden， when one of the children，Basil，offered to help．</p>
<p>一开始她被带到一户英国人家，他们认识她的父母。可她讨厌他们凌乱的房间和吵吵闹闹的孩子们，而宁愿一个人在花园里玩。一天，她正玩着最喜欢的造花园游戏，那家的孩子巴兹尔走过来想帮她忙。</p>
<p>‘Go away！’cried Mary．‘I don't want your help！’</p>
<p>“走开！”玛丽大声喊道，“我才不用你帮忙！”</p>
<p>For a moment Basil looked angry，and then he began to laugh He danced round and round Mary，and sang a funny little song about Miss Mary and her stupid flowers．This made Mary very cross indeed．No one had ever laughed at her so unkindly．</p>
<p>巴兹尔呆站了一会儿，很生气，可很快又乐开了。他围着玛丽又蹦又跳，一边唱起一支滑稽的有关玛丽小姐和她愚蠢的花儿的歌。这可把玛丽气坏了，还从来没人这么刻薄地嘲笑过她呢！</p>
<p>‘You're going home soon，’said Basil．‘And we're all very pleased you're leaving！’</p>
<p>“你就快回家了，”巴兹尔说。“我们真高兴你快走了。”</p>
<p>‘I'm pleased too，’replied Mary．‘But where's home？’</p>
<p>“我也高兴，”玛丽答道。“可回哪儿的家？”</p>
<p>‘You're stupid if you don't know that！’laughed Basil． England，of course！You're going to live with your uncle，Mr Archibald Graven．’</p>
<p>“你连这都不知道，可真够傻的！”巴兹尔笑道，“当然是英国！你要去跟你舅舅阿奇伯德&middot;克莱文先生住了！”</p>
<p>‘I've never heard of him，’said Mary coldly．</p>
<p>“我从来没听说过他。”玛丽冷冷地说。</p>
<p>‘But I know about him because I heard Father and Mother talking，’said Basil．‘He lives in a big lonely old house，and has no friends，because he's so badtempered．He's got a crooked back，and he's horrid！’</p>
<p>“可我知道，我听我爸爸妈妈谈论过他。他住在一幢孤零零的、又大又旧的房子里，一个朋友都没有，因为他脾气太坏了，他还是个驼背，可怕极了！”</p>
<p>‘I don't believe you！’cried Mary．But the next day Basil's parents explained that she was going to live with her uncle in Yorkshire，in the north of England．Mary looked bored and cross and said nothing．</p>
<p>“我才不信呢！”玛丽大声说。可是第二天，巴兹尔的父母解释说她将要到英格兰北部的约克郡，跟她的舅舅住在一起。玛丽显得又烦躁又恼怒，可什么都没说。</p>
<p>After the long sea journey，she was met in London by Mr Craven's housekeeper，Mrs Medlock．Together they travelled north by train．Mrs Medlock was a large woman，with a very red face and bright black eyes．Mary did not like her，but that was not surprising，because she did not usually like people．Mrs Medlock did not like Mary either．</p>
<p>轮船在海上航行了很久，克莱文先生的管家梅洛太太到伦敦来接玛丽，带她坐火车去北方。梅洛太太是个高大的女人，红脸膛，长着一双明亮的黑眼睛。玛丽不喜欢她，这也没什么好奇怪的，因为她谁也不喜欢。梅洛太太也不怎么喜欢玛丽。</p>
<p>‘What a disagreeable child！’thought the housekeeper．‘But perhaps I should talk to her．’</p>
<p>“这孩子可真不讨人喜欢！”管家心里想。“不过也许我能跟她聊聊。”</p>
<p>‘I can tell you a bit about your uncle if you like，’she said aloud．‘He lives in a big old house，a long way from anywhere． There are nearly a hundred rooms，but most of them are shut and locked．There's a big park round the house，and all kinds of gardens．Well，what do you think of that？’</p>
<p>“要是你愿意，我可以给你讲讲你舅舅的事。”她大声说。“他住在一幢很大的老宅子里，离哪儿都不近。那个宅子差不多有一百个房间，可大部分都是上了锁的。房子周围有一片很大的园林，还有各式的花园。你觉得怎么样？”</p>
<p>‘Nothing，’replied Mary．‘It doesn't matter to me．’</p>
<p>“不怎么样，”玛丽答道。“跟我一点关系都没有。”</p>
<p>Mrs Medlock laughed．‘You're a hard little girl！Well，if you don't care，Mr Craven doesn't either．He never spends time on anyone．He's got a crooked back，you see，and although he's always been rich，he was never really happy until he married．’</p>
<p>梅洛太太笑了，“你这个小倔丫头！好啦，如果你不在乎，克莱文先生自然也不在乎。他从不把时间花在任何人身上，他是个驼背，而且，尽管一直都很有钱，在他结婚之前他从来没有真正快乐过。”</p>
<p>‘Married？’repeated Mary in surprise．</p>
<p>“结婚？”玛丽惊奇地重复道。</p>
<p>‘Yes，he married a sweet，pretty girl，and he loved her deeply．So when she died—’</p>
<p>“是啊，娶了个温柔美丽的姑娘，他非常非常爱她。所以那姑娘一死——”</p>
<p>‘Oh！Did she die？’asked Mary，interested．</p>
<p>“哦！她死了吗？”玛丽感兴趣地问道。</p>
<p>‘Yes，she did．And now he doesn't care about anybody．If he's at home，he stays in his room and sees nobody．He won't want to see you，so you must stay out of his way and do what you're told．’</p>
<p>“是啊，她死了。所以克莱文先生谁也不关心了，他在家的时候就呆在屋子里谁也不见，他不会想见你的，所以你必须躲着他，照别人吩咐你的去做。”</p>
<p>Mary stared out of the train window at the grey sky and the rain．She was not looking forward to life at her uncle's house．</p>
<p>玛丽望着车窗外灰色的天空和飘落的雨水，对于住在舅舅家的生活没有一丝期盼。</p>
<p>The train journey lasted all day，and it was dark when they arrived at the station．Then there was a long drive to get to the house．It was a cold，windy night，and it was raining heavily． After a while Mary began to hear a strange，wild noise．She looked out of the window，but could see nothing except the darkness．</p>
<p>火车走了一天，到站时天已经黑了。可离那幢房子还有很远的路，要搭马车才能到。这是一个寒冷的夜晚，风疾雨骤。过了一阵，玛丽听到一种奇怪的狂野的声音，她向窗外看去，可除了黑暗什么都看不见。</p>
<p>‘What's that noise？’she asked Mrs Medlock．‘It's—It's not the sea，is it？’</p>
<p>“那是什么声音？”她问梅洛太太，“那——那不是海，对么？”</p>
<p>‘No，that's the moor．It's the sound the wind makes，blowing across the moor．’</p>
<p>“对，那不是海，是荒原的声音，是风吹过荒原时发出的声音。”</p>
<p>‘What is a moor？’</p>
<p>“荒原是什么？”</p>
<p>‘It's just miles and miles of wild land，with no trees or houses．Your uncle's house is right on the edge of the moor．’</p>
<p>“就是大片大片的荒地，没有树，也没有房屋，你舅舅家就住在荒原的尽头。”</p>
<p>Mary listened to the strange，frightening sound．‘I don't like it，’she thought．‘I don't like it．’She looked more disagreeable than ever．</p>
<p>玛丽听着那奇怪而又可怕的声音，心里想着“我讨厌它，我讨厌它。”她看上去更加不讨人喜欢了。</p><a href='2.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
