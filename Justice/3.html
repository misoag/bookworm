<p><b>3“我让他高兴” </b></p>
<p>Alan Cole lay in his bed,listening to a bird singing in the hospital garden. It was nearly dark outside now,and very quiet ．He liked to lie like this，remembering．</p>
<p>阿兰&middot;科尔躺在床上，倾听着医院花园里的小鸟的鸣唱。现在外面几乎黑了，而且很静。他喜欢这样躺着，回忆过去。</p>
<p>He remembered the way Anna had kissed him，and looked into his eyes．He remembered her red-brown hair，her blue eyes，the soft，dry touch of her lips，her deep，happy laugh．She liked to drink whisky before they made love，and after-wards，she often held his head on her chest and stroked .his hair．</p>
<p>他回想起安娜是怎样吻他，怎样注视他的双眼。他回想起她那棕红色的头发，蓝色的眼睛，柔软、干燥的唇感和她那深沉、开怀的笑。她喜欢在做爱前喝威士忌，完事儿后她常把他揽在胸前井抚摸他的头发。</p>
<p>I loved that，he remembered．I felt like a child again，safe and comfortable．Sometimes I fell asleep．</p>
<p>我喜欢那样，他回想着，我觉得又像个孩子了，既安全又舒服。有时我就睡着了。</p>
<p>And then what? On the night before the bombing，he and Anna had been out for a meal in a restaurant．Then 'they had gone to the Mews to look at the horses．The guards knew she was his girlfriend，so they didn't think it was unusual．One of the horses，Sandman，had hurt his leg that morning，Alan re-membered ．In the evening the leg had been hot，so he had put ice on it .Lucky Sandman，Alan thought-he couldn't pull the coach next day，so he was still alive now．</p>
<p>后来呢？在爆炸前的那天晚上，他和安娜出去在饭馆吃了顿饭。然后他们就去马厩看马。门卫知道她是他的女朋友，所以没想有什么不寻常。阿兰想起，那天早晨有一匹叫山德曼的马伤了一条腿。晚上，那条马腿发热了，所以他就把冰放在上面。幸运的山德曼，阿兰想—第二天它没能拉马车，所以现在还活着。</p>
<p>Afterwards they went back to his house and made love．Anna had been very excited，Alan remembered，it had been very good．Then he had slept until morning．He woke at six o'clock and dressed quietly，but she woke up just before he Ian Cole lay in his bed，listening to a bird singing in the hospital garden．It was nearly dark outside now，and tlt. ' She opened her eyes，smiled at him，and held out her arms to him sleepily．He kissed her，and she said，“Goodbye，</p>
<p>后来，他们回到他家并做爱。阿兰记得安娜当时非常兴奋，那事感觉非常好。然后他一直睡到第二天早晨。他6点钟醒来，悄悄地穿上衣服，但安娜在他要走时醒来。她睁开眼睛，朝她微笑了笑，睡眼惺松地向他伸出双臂。他吻了吻她，她说：“再见，亲爱的。”</p>
<p>That was the last time he had seen hei.</p>
<p>那是他见她的最后一面。</p>
<p>He was still thinking about Anna when he drove the Queen's coach to Parliament，with the six fine horses in front of him．For a moment he thought he saw her in the crowd，watching…</p>
<p>当他驾着六匹好马拉的女王马车朝国会驶去时，他脑子里还想着安娜。有那么一瞬间，他觉得他在人群中看见了安娜，她正在观看......</p>
<p>Alan didn't want to think about what had‘happened next．He stared into the darkness outside the hospital window and thought：why hasn't she come to see me?</p>
<p>阿兰不想再往下想。他凝视着医院窗外漆黑的夜晚，想道：她为什么不来看我呢？</p>
<p>Perhaps she never really loved me，he thought．Perhaps she's gone back to her husband，or found a younger man .It's cruel and painful，but I can't change it．I'll never see her again.</p>
<p>也许她从来没真爱过我，他想，也许她回她丈夫那儿去了，或是找了一个更年轻的。这真残酷，真痛苦，可我无法改变。我再也见不着她了。</p>
<p>He remembered her warm body next to his，and the way she whispered his name．There must be another reason．She loves me，I know she does．She'll come to see me when she gets my letter．</p>
<p>他想起她在他身旁时那温暖的身体，想起她是如何轻轻呼唤他的名字。这肯定另有原因。她爱我，我知道她爱我。她接到我的信会来看我的。</p>
<p>I wish Jane could meet her．</p>
<p>我希望简能看见她。</p>
<p>Outside，night had fallen，and the birds had stopped singing. Alan Cole lay quietly on his bed，the tears running slowly down his face．</p>
<p>外面，夜已经降临，鸟儿已不唱了。阿兰&middot;科尔静静地躺在床上，眼泪顺着面颊慢慢地消了下来。</p>
<p>Jane sat on the chair in her flat and listened .to the man and the woman arguing in her kitchen．She could hear，but she ouldn't speak or see，because the man had put a bag over her head ．Her arms and legs were still tied to the 'chair，and her face ached where the man had hit her．</p>
<p>简坐在房中的椅子上，听到那一男一女在厨房里争吵着什么。她听得见、却不能叫，也看不见，因为那个男的在她头上套了一个袋子。她的手脚还捆在椅子上，脸上被那男人打过的地方还在隐隐作痛。</p>
<p>She tried to get her hands free.She pulled as hard as she could，but the rope just burned her wrists．All she could do was listen to the voices in the kitchen．</p>
<p>她想把手挣脱出来。她使劲地往外拽着双手，可绳子只磨得她手跳火辣辣的。她唯一能做的就是侧耳倾听厨房里的讲话声。</p>
<p>‘We must phone hum now，Kev．We can't wait．’</p>
<p>“我们必须现在就给他打电话，凯夫。我们不能等了。”</p>
<p>‘We've got to wait．It's too dangerous to do it .from here，Anna．Wait until we're ready to go.’</p>
<p>“我们必须等。从这儿打电话太危险，安娜。等我们准备好走的时候再说。”</p>
<p>Anna ! Jane thought．Was this her father's Anna? No，no，lots of women were called Anna．</p>
<p>安娜！简想，这个人是不是爸爸的那个安娜？不，不，很多女人都叫安娜。</p>
<p>‘But we can't go until tonight,’Anna said．‘There are too many people around during the day．And;every minute is im-portant! Perhaps Cole ,has already talked to, the police about me．Oh God，I wish the bomb had killed him with the others！’</p>
<p>‘但我们直到今晚才能走，”安娜说，“白天这儿周围人太多了。而且每一分钟都重要。也许科尔已经跟警察说起我了。噢，上帝啊，真希望那顺炸弹将他和别人一块儿炸死！”</p>
<p>‘Well，it didn't．And it didn't kill the Queen．’</p>
<p>“唉，没有。而且连女王也没炸死。”</p>
<p>Jane's body was shaking．This was her'father's Anna！The woman was talking about her father，and the bomb ．And then Jane remembered where she had seen the woman before．</p>
<p>简的身体在发抖。这个人确实是她父亲的安娜！那个女人正在谈论简的父亲，还有炸弹。接着，简想起是在什么地方见过那个女人了。</p>
<p>Outside Parliament，with a camera，shaking it angrily．Taking photos of the back of people's heads，Then pushing forwards to get closer，pressing the camera button again…a second before the bomb exploded．</p>
<p>国会大厦外，一个女人拿着照相机，生气地摇晃着；她给人们的后脑勺照相；她向前挤着，想靠近些，又按下了照相机的快门一就在爆炸前一秒。</p>
<p>The voices in the kitchen stopped．The door opened，some one came into the room.What now?</p>
<p>厨房里没声了。门开了，有人走进屋里。现在该怎么样了？</p>
<p>Jane heard the click of“gun.</p>
<p>简听到扣动手枪扳机的声音。</p>
<p>‘Phone call for you，Mr Cole．You're popular. today，aren't you?’The nurse smiled，pushed the telephone table next to his bed，and went out.</p>
<p>“您的电话，科尔先生。今天您可成了知名人士，不是吗？”护士微笑着，把电话桌推到床边，走了出去。</p>
<p>Alan picked up the phone．‘Hello?’</p>
<p>阿兰拿起电话。“喂？＂</p>
<p>‘Mr Cole? This is Detective David Hall．You remember I came to see you yesterday．I'm ringing because I've got a few more questions to ask you．Is it all right if I come over to see you now ？’</p>
<p>“科尔先生吗？我是大卫&middot;荷尔警探。你一定记得我昨天去看过你。我给你电话是想再问你几个何题，我现在过去看你，行吗？”</p>
<p>‘Er…well，I suppose so．But I've told you everything I know．’</p>
<p>“哦…哦，可以吧。可我把所知道的什么都跟你说了。”</p>
<p>‘Yes，I'm sure．But it's just that we have to get all the facts right．I'll come over now．Is that OK？’</p>
<p>“是的，我知道。可我们得核对一下事实。我现在就来，行吗？”</p>
<p>‘Yes，fine．I…’</p>
<p>“行，好吧。我……”</p>
<p>‘Great！See you in a few minutes，then．’</p>
<p>“好的！那么一会儿见。”</p>
<p>Alan put the phone .down slpsily ．He felt old，and tired，and very，very lonely. Perhaps I'll ring Jane later when this man s gone，he thought．I hope she remembered to post the letter．</p>
<p>阿兰慢慢地放下电话。他觉得自己老了，而且非常非常孤独。也许等这个人走了以后我该给简打个电话，他想，希望她没忘了寄信。</p>
<p>Kev pulled the bag off Jane's head and she saw the gun a few centimetres from her eyes．‘I'm going to untie this cloth round your mouth，’ Kev said．‘If you scream，I'll put a bullet through your head．This gun is silenced，no one will hear any-thing．’</p>
<p>凯夫从简的头上拽下袋子，简发现枪口就离她眼睛几厘米远。“我要把围在你嘴上的这块布解下来。凯夫说，“你要是叫一声的话，我就叫枪子儿穿过你的脑袋。这枝枪装了消音器，没人会听见什么的。”</p>
<p>They untied the cloth and pulled her chair over to the wall，where the phone was. The gun was pointing at her head all the time．</p>
<p>他们解开布，把她坐的椅子拉到墙边，电话就在那儿。那枝枪一直对着她的脑袋。</p>
<p>‘Do just what we tell you，’Anna said．‘And everything will be all right．’</p>
<p>“按照我们说的做，”安娜说，“那样什么都好办。”</p>
<p>Jane was suddenly wild. with anger．She said，‘You're Anna,aren't you? My father loves you -- he thinks you're wonderful .But you don't care about him at all，do you? You wish the bomb had killed him．’</p>
<p>简突然气愤得发狂。她说：“你是安娜，不对吗？我父亲爱你－他觉得你好极了。可你却根本不在乎他，是不是？你希望炸弹把他炸死。”</p>
<p>‘Of course I care about him，’Anna said softly．‘He's very important to me .That's why I'm going to phone him now，and you're going to talk to him too．&quot;</p>
<p>“我当然在乎他，”安娜轻声说，“他对我很重要。所以我现在要给他打电话，而且你也要跟他讲话。”</p>
<p>Jane stared at her，then at Kev．‘Why?：</p>
<p>简盯着她看了看，然后又盯着凯夫。“为什么？”</p>
<p>Anna laughed．‘I'm going to ask him to keep our love a secret ．I have a very difficult husband，you know．’</p>
<p>安娜大笑着。“我要让他对我们的爱保密。你知道，我可有个不好对付的丈夫。”</p>
<p>What's the woman talking about? Jane thought.What does all this mean? Then，suddenly，a lot of things came together in her mind，and everything became clear．Anna had been with her father in the Mews on the night before the bombing．In the kitchen Anna had spoken about her father talking to the police .Jane could hear from Kev's voice that he was Irish，and he and Anna had moved out of Bowater Gardens on the moining of the bombing ．Later，Anna had been outside Parlia-inent，doing strange things with a camera when the bomb ex-ploded ．If it was a camera．Perhaps it had been a radio，sending a signal to the bomb．Oh God!</p>
<p>“这个女人在说什么？简想。这一切意昧着什么？接着，她脑子里突然一下涌现出许多事，而且每件事都变得清楚了。爆炸前一晚，安娜曾和父亲一起在马厩呆过。刚才安娜在厨房说起父亲跟警察谈话的事。简可以从凯夫的声音听出他是爱尔兰人，而且就在爆炸那天早上他和安娜搬出了堡渥特花园。后来，安娜曾在国会大厦外，在炸弹爆炸时拿着照相机做着奇怪的事，如果那是台照相机的话。也许那是无线电，正向炸弹发信号。噢，天啊！</p>
<p>“You're the terrorists，aren't you?’she whispered．‘You did it，Anna．You put the bomb in the Queen's coach．You exploded it with a camera．I saw you，outside Parliament．You're terrorists一murderi呀terrorists，both of you！’</p>
<p>“你们是恐怖分子，是不是？”她低声说，“是你干的，安娜！是你把炸弹放到女王的马车里。你用一台照相机引爆了炸弹。我看见你了，就在国会外边。你们是恐体分子—杀人的恐怖分子，你们俩全是！”’</p>
<p>Kev smiled coldly．‘Well，well．What a clever little girl！But you're wrong ．The police have arrested the terrorists．It was in .the newspapers this morning．’</p>
<p>凯夫冷笑了一下。“对，对。真聪明的小姑娘！可你错了。警察已经抓到了恐怖分子。今天早晨的报纸已经登了。”</p>
<p>‘So? They're the wrong men，aren't they? It～you two，I know it was！You killed five people，and took away my father's leg，and now two innocent men will go to prison for thirty years，for something you did．But you don't care．’</p>
<p>“那又怎么样呢？他们不是，不是吗？你们俩才是，我知道！你们杀了五个人，夺去了我爸爸的一条腿，现在又要有两个无辜的人为了你们所做的一切去坐30年牢。可你们并不在乎。”</p>
<p>Kev's eyes were suddenly full of hate．‘Care? About what?We're fighting to free Ireland．If the British put the wrong people in prison，that's not our problem. We care about stay-ing free ．That's good for Ireland．’</p>
<p>凯夫的眼中忽然充满了仇恨。“在乎？在乎什么？我们是为解放爱尔兰而战。要是英国人抓错了人，那可不是我们的问题。我们在乎自由。那是为了爱尔兰好。”</p>
<p>‘Yes，and I suppose it's good for Ireland to use innocent people like my father一to make love to hinzjust because you wanted to get into the Mews to put the bomb in the coach．Did you enjoy that，Anna? Do you feel proud of it?’</p>
<p>“是啊，而且利用就像我父亲那样天真无辜的人，也是为了爱尔兰—你和我父亲好，只是因为你想进马厩把炸弹放进马车里。你当时很喜欢吧，安娜？你是不是觉得很自豪？”</p>
<p>Anna laughed，a strange，quiet，cruel laugh．‘Yes，of course I enjoyed it，little girl．And your father enjoyed it too．I made him happy．’</p>
<p>安娜笑起来，那是一种奇怪、悄然而又冷酷的笑。“是的，我当然很高兴，小姑娘。而且你父亲也很喜欢。我使他高兴。”</p>
<p>‘Happy！’Jane said．‘ You nearly killed him！’</p>
<p>“高兴？！”简说，“你差点儿杀了他！”</p>
<p>‘Yes ．I'm sorry he didn't die，while he was so happy．’</p>
<p>“是埃很遗撼他投有在那么高兴的时候死。”</p>
<p>Silence ．There was no answer to that，Jane thought．</p>
<p>沉默。没有什么回驳的，简想。</p>
<p>‘Let's get on with it，’said Kev angrily．‘We're losing time．’</p>
<p>“我们接着干吧。”凯夫生气地说，“我们时间不多了。”</p>
<p>Tears came into Jane's eyes.‘You dirty: murderers，'she whispered.</p>
<p>简眼中噙着泪。“你们这些肮脏的凶手，”她小声说。</p>
<p>‘Kew hit her across the face witft,his,, gun.Jane felt blood in her mouth. One of her teeth was broken．’</p>
<p>凯夫用枪打了她的脸。简感到嘴里有血。她的一颗牙被打碎了。</p>
<p>‘We could kill her,’ Kev said，‘and get gout of the country tonight.’</p>
<p>“我们现在就可以杀了她，”凯夫说，“今天晚上就离开这个国家。”</p>
<p>‘no，no，’ Anna said.‘We must talk to Cole first.’</p>
<p>“不，不，”安娜说，“我们必须先和科尔谈谈。”</p>
<p>‘But we can't let her go，’Kev said．‘She's seen our faces.She knows too much.’</p>
<p>“可我们不能让她走，”凯夫说，“她已经看到我们的脸了。她知道得太多了。”</p>
<p>‘Oh no，’Anna said，Tier voice was soft and cruel.&quot;of course not．But we'll keep her give -for, some weeks；`to make sure that Cole stays quiet. Pick up the phone , Kev.’</p>
<p>“噢，不能，安娜说。她的声音轻柔而冷酷。“当然不能了。可我们要让她活几个星期，以确认科尔没讲出来。拿起电话来，凯夫。”</p><a href='4.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
