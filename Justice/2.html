<p><b>2 安娜 </b></p>
<p>That night Alan was moved to another hospital ,where they would fit him with an artificial leg,Jane went with him and slept in a visitor's room there．In the morning she bought a newspaper ．She was right about the police：‘They've got them，Dad！’she said．‘Read this！’</p>
<p>那晚，阿兰被转到另一座医院，他们要在那儿给他装一只假腿。简也跟着一起去了，在那儿的一间探视室里睡了一觉。早晨，她买了一张报纸。她对警察的猜测是对的。“他们已经抓住了那些人，爸爸！”她说道，“看这个！”</p>
<p>Police yesterday arrested two Irishmen who they think put a bomb in me Queen's coach last week ．The police said，‘Last week the coach went to a factory in south Loadon to have new wheels fitted，and we believe the bomb was placed in the each there．The two Irishmen worked at this factory，and two days before the bombing，they went on holiday to Ireland．We think the bomb had a clock in it，which was meant to explode at eleven o'clock outside Parliament. Luckily for the Queen，the bomb exploded after she had left the coach.’</p>
<p>警方昨天抓获了两名被认为上周在女王马车中放炸弹的爱尔兰人。警方说：“上周那辆马车曾到伦敦南部的一家工厂安装新轮子，我们相信就是在那里安放炸弹的。那两名爱尔兰人在这家工厂工作，炸弹爆炸两天前他们却到爱尔兰度假去了。我们认为炸弹上安装了定时器，定在11点在国会大厦外爆炸。对女王来讲幸运的是，炸弹在女王离开了马车之后才爆炸。”</p>
<p>Alan Cole put the newspaper down slowly ．He looked pleased．‘Thank God for that，’he said．</p>
<p>阿兰&middot;科尔慢慢放下报纸。他看上去很高兴。“感谢上帝，”他说。</p>
<p>But why did they want the bomb to explode outside Parlia-ment?’Jane asked．‘The Queen was in the coach for twenty minutes一why not blow the coach up earlier?’</p>
<p>“但是他们为什么要让炸弹在国会外边爆炸呢？”简问，“女王在马车里呆了20分钟—为什么不早点炸飞马车呢？”</p>
<p>‘I don't know．Perhaps they wanted good pictures on TV，’That night Alan was moved to another hospital，where they would fit him with an artificial leg．Jane went Alan said．‘It was lucky for the Queen. But not lucky for me，or for the poor people who were killed.’</p>
<p>“不知道，也许他们想让画面在电视上更好看些。”阿兰说，“对女王来说很幸运，可我却不走运，还有那些被炸死的人。”</p>
<p>‘No．’,f avee put her han on her father's，and remembered those minutes outside Parliament. The American map using his video camera,and the woman with red-brown hair shaking her camera angrily.Then…she shut her eyes,and saw the smoke, and the horse screaming，and the blood and bodies everywhere ...</p>
<p>“是埃”简把手放在父亲的手上，回想起国会门外的那几分钟。那个美国男人用摄像机拍摄，那个长着棕红色头发的女人生气地摇着照相机。然后……她合上了双眼，仿佛看到了那浓烟，那马的嘶鸣状以及四处的鲜血和尸体……</p>
<p>What kind of people could do that?</p>
<p>会是什么样的人干的呢？</p>
<p>‘I sune the terrorists watched it on TV．’she said. 'They were in iretana wnen zne oomu exptvaca.'</p>
<p>“我想恐怖分子已经在电视上看到了那场面。”她说，“炸弹爆炸时他们正在爱尔兰。”</p>
<p>‘I expect they did，’Alan said.‘I expect they were .laugh-ing as people died.But I'm pleased the police have caught them．Now perhaps they'll lease me t,Iane．’</p>
<p>“我想他们看了，”阿兰说，“我想人们死的时候他们正在笑。但我很高兴警察已经抓到了他们。也许他们现在可以让我清静一下了。”</p>
<p>‘Who? The police? Dad，what do you. mean?'</p>
<p>“谁？警察吗？爸爸，您是什么意思？”</p>
<p>Alan sighed．‘Well，yesterday they came to ask me about the night before the boriibing.I went back to the Mews at about ten o'clock that night，you know，‘to look at a horse with a bad leg．I often do that ．They asked if I saw anything strange，or looked at the coach.’</p>
<p>阿兰叹了口气。“唉，他们昨天来问我爆炸前一天晚上的事。我那天晚上十点左右回到马厩，你知道，是去看看那匹坏了一条腿的马。我常那样做。他们问我是否看到有什么异常或是看没看过那马车。”</p>
<p>‘And what did you tell them?'．</p>
<p>“那您跟他们说什么了呢？”</p>
<p>Alan looked angry.‘What do you think，Janie? Of course I saw nothing strange！I was looking at the horse; not the coach ．And we were only there half an hour.</p>
<p>阿兰生气了。“你怎么想呢，简妮？’我当然没看到有什么异常！我是去看马，又不是去看马车。而且我们就在那儿呆了半个小时。”</p>
<p>‘We，Dad?，Jane asked．‘Was someone with you?’</p>
<p>“我们，爸爸？” 简问道，“有别人和您在一起吗？”</p>
<p>Alan hesitated.‘Well，yes...a lady friend of mine，Anna. You haven'，met her，Janie，but I've told her about you ．She's nice，you'll like her．She sometimes comes to see the horses with me．'</p>
<p>阿兰犹豫了一下。“啊，是啊……我的一个女朋友，安娜。你还没见过她，简妮，但我已经跟她提起过你了。她很好，你会喜欢她的。她有时和我一起去看马。”</p>
<p>‘Jane felt embarrassed．After-her mother had died four years ago‘Jane had lived at home with her father．Once，he had brought a woman home to the house，but Jane had had a terrible argument with ．her，and the woman had left ．There had been no other women，until Jane left home to go to university．Now…？</p>
<p>简感到不太自然。四年前妈妈去世以后，她和爸爸住在家里。爸爸曾带回家一个女人，但简和那女人大吵了一顿，那女人就走了。从那以后就再也没有别的女人来过，直到简离开了家去上大学。现在....？</p>
<p>Well，her father was an adult，of course he could have woman friends．But Jane hated it．She had loved her mother too much．And she loved her father too．</p>
<p>然而，父亲是大人，当然可以有女朋友。但简不喜欢。她太爱母亲，也爱父亲。</p>
<p>'What kind of woman is she?’she asked angrily．</p>
<p>“她是什么样的女人？”她不高兴地问。</p>
<p>He's 'my father，she thought - I don't want another woman taking him away from me.</p>
<p>他是我的父亲，她想—我不想让别的女人把他从我身边抢走。</p>
<p>‘Tall ．Pretty．Red-brown hair．She likes horses and...films .We go to the cinema a lot.’</p>
<p>“高个儿。很漂亮。棕红色的头发。她喜欢马和......电影。我们经常一起去着电影。”</p>
<p>‘is she in love with you?’</p>
<p>“她和您在恋爱吗？”</p>
<p>‘Well...perhaps，Janie，I don't know. I've only known her a few weeks．You'll like her，Janie，she's good fun ’</p>
<p>“啊…可能吧，简妮，我不知道。我刚认识她几个星期。你会喜欢她的，简妮，她很有意思。”</p>
<p>Jane was still angry，she couldn't stop herself．‘Then why isn't she here? Why hasn't she come to visit you?’</p>
<p>简还是不高兴，她无法控制自己的情绪。“那么她为什么没来这儿？她为什么没来看您呢？”</p>
<p>Now Alan looked embarrassed．‘Well，I was going to ask you，Janie…she doesn't have a phone，you see，and…perhaps she thinks I'm dead，like the others．God knows what she'll think of a man with one leg，but I do want to see her…so I've written this letter.Could you post it for me，Janie? Please.’</p>
<p>阿兰现在着上去很尴尬。“哦，我正想请你，简妮……你看，她没有电话，而且……也许她以为我已经死了，就像别人一样。一上帝知道她会怎么看待一个只有一条腿的男人，但我真的想见她，……所以我写了这封信。你能帮我寄这封信吗，简妮？劳驾了。”</p>
<p>Jane took the letter and read the address．Anna Barry，14 Bowater Gardens，London NE11.</p>
<p>简拿过信看了看地址：安娜&middot;芭瑞，堡渥特花园14号，伦敦NE11。</p>
<p>‘Dad，your name was in the newspapers．This woman can read，can't she? She must know you're alive．’</p>
<p>“爸爸：您的名字登在报纸上。这个女人认得字，对吧？她应该知道您还活着。”</p>
<p>‘Yes，but…perhaps she doesuxt know which hospital．I don't know．Janie，please — don't be difficult．’</p>
<p>“是啊，可是... 也许她不知道我在哪家医院。我不知道。简妮，请 — ，别太难说话了。”</p>
<p>‘Have you told the police about this woman，Dad？’</p>
<p>“您和警察谈起过这个女人吗，爸爸？”</p>
<p>‘Not yet．’</p>
<p>“还没有。”</p>
<p>‘Why not? They'll ask. her questions，won't they?'</p>
<p>“为什么没有？他们会问她一些问题，是不是？”</p>
<p>Alan sighed.‘Yes，I suppose so&middot;I warned her about that in the letter.Perhaps that's why she hasn't come.You.see…it's a bit difficult，Janie．Anna has a husband…and so it will be embarrassing for her if he finds out about, a'. Perhaps the police will want to, ask her husband questions，too，and then terell be all kinds of trouble．’</p>
<p>‘阿兰叹气道：“是啊，我想是。我在信中警告她了。也许那就是她不来的原因。你知道……事儿有点儿困难，简妮。安娜有丈夫……所以要是她丈夫知道了我们的事儿，她会很难堪。也许 警察也会间她丈夫一些问题，那就会有各种各样的麻烦。”</p>
<p>‘I see，’Jane said．She felt miserable．My own father，she thought，is in love with a married woman．Then she saw the tears in his eyes，and his tired white face；and felt angry with herself，not him．why，she thought，shouldn't my. father fall in love? It happens to everyone，and you can't always choose the best person．Now he's here with only one leg and I'm angry with him. I'm his daughter，I should help him！Perhaps this Anna really is a nice woman，with a cruel husband．</p>
<p>“我明白了，”简说。她感到很雄过。我父亲爱上了一个有夫之妇，她想。接着，她看到父亲眼中的泪水和他那苍白而疲惫的面孔；于是她生自己的而不是父亲的气。为什么爸爸就不能恋爱？她想。每个人都会恋爱，不可能谁都能选择最好的人。现在他在这儿，只剩一条腿了，我还生他的气。我是他女儿，我应帮他！也许这个安娜真是个有个残酷的丈夫的好女人。</p>
<p>She smiled，and said，‘I'm sorry，Dad．Of course I'll post your letter．But…isn't it a bit，dangerous，sending。letter? f-ller husband could read it．’</p>
<p>她微笑着，说：“对不起，爸爸。我当然会帮您寄信的。但是……寄信不是有点儿不安全吗？她丈夫会看到的。”</p>
<p>‘No，it's OK.Bowater Gardens is just where she's living at the moment ．It isn't her home．I don't know where her hus-band lives ．I don't want to know．’ He..smiled and took her hand．‘She's a lovely woman，Janie，really she is ．You'll like her if you meet her，you know．’Outside the hospital，Jane walked&quot; slowly down the street．</p>
<p>“不，没事的。堡握特花园只是她现在住的地方，不是她的家。我不知道她丈夫住哪儿。我不想知道。”阿兰徽笑着，并握住简的手。“她是个可爱的女人，简妮，真的。你见到她时会喜欢她的，你知道。，</p>
<p>She felt sad，and a little lonely.I wish my mother was still alive，she thought．I wish Mum was -alive now，sitting with Dad in一the hospital．I don't want all, these problems.一Why does Dad need another woman?</p>
<p>医院外面简慢慢地沿着马路走着。她感到伤心，还有点儿孤独。我真希望妈妈还活在世上，她想，要是妈妈还活着，就坐在医院里爸爸身边多好啊！我不想有这些问题。为什么爸爸还需要另一个女人呢？</p>
<p>Oh Mum，why did you die? I need someone to talk to．</p>
<p>唤，妈妈，您为什么要死呢？我真想和某个人说说心里话。</p>
<p>She took the letter out of her pocket and looked at it．I wonder what this Anna Barry is like，she thought．Perhaps she is nice，like Dad says. Perhaps I could talk to her ．Per-haps she really does love Dad; perhaps she can help me look after him．</p>
<p>她从口袋里掏出那封信并看了看。我不知道这个安娜&middot;芭瑞什么样，她想着。也许真像爸爸说的那样她的确很好。也许我能对她谈谈。也许她真的爱爸爸；也许她可以帮我照顾爸爸。</p>
<p>But why hasn't she come to see him?</p>
<p>但是她为什么不来看爸爸呢？</p>
<p>She looked at the address again．14 Bowater Gardens，London NEll，That wasn't far from her own student flat．</p>
<p>她又看了一遍地址：堡握特花园14号，伦教NE11。离她自己的学生公寓不太远。</p>
<p>Why not take the letter myself? she thought．Then，if this Anna opens the door，I can talk to her myself . If I meet her，at least I'll find out what she's like．</p>
<p>为什么不亲自送去呢？她想。那样，如果安娜出来开门，我就可以亲自服她说话了。要是我见着她，至少可以知道她是什么样子。</p>
<p>Jane put the letter in her bag and walked quickly to the underground station．Am I full of anger，she wondered，or hope?</p>
<p>简把信放回包里，快速走向地铁站。她问自己：我是满怀怨恨呢，还是满怀希望？</p>
<p>14 Bowater Gardens was an old house in a quiet street in north London ．Jane took the letter out of her bag，and rang the bell ．Nothing happened．</p>
<p>堡握特花园14号是伦敦北城的一条安静的街道上的一座老房子。简掏出信，按了按门铃。可什么也没有发生。</p>
<p>Damn！she thought．She rang again．Still no answer．She tried the door，but it was locked、So she put the letter- through the letter-box and turned away.</p>
<p>该死！她想。她又按了一次。还是没有人。她试着推了推门，可门锁着。于是她把信塞进信箱，转身就走。接着她又停了下来。</p>
<p>Then she stopped，I've come all this way to meet this woman，Jane thought，and I want to know what she's like．She's important to my father，so she's important to me．I'll wait．</p>
<p>我来这儿就是为了见这个女人，简想，想知道她是什么样。她对我父亲很重要，所以对我很重要。我等着吧。</p>
<p>As she stood there，a woman came out of the next-door house. She had grey hair and the kind of face that enjoys watching the neighbours and talking about them.</p>
<p>她正站在那儿时，从邻居家出来一位妇女。这位妇女长着灰色的头发和一张可以看出她爱打听邻居的事并议论他们的脸。</p>
<p>‘They've gone；there's no use waiting,’the woman said．‘I saw you ring the bell so I came to tell you．’</p>
<p>“他们已经走了，你在这儿等没用。”那女人说，“我看见你在按门铃，所以来告诉你。”</p>
<p>‘Are you sure?’Jane said．‘I was looking for Anna．’</p>
<p>“你肯定吗？＂简说，“我找安娜。”</p>
<p>‘The girl with red hair? That's right，she did live here，but she moved out with her boyfriend two days ago．It was the morning of that terrible bomb — that's why I remember it. The house. is empty now．I had. a look through the windows，and they've taken everything‘’</p>
<p>“长着红头发的那个女孩？没错，她住过这儿，但两天前就和男朋友搬走了。就是爆炸那天早晨—所以我记得这事。现在屋子已经空了。我从窗子往里看过，他们把所有的东西都带走了。”</p>
<p>Boyfriend！So Anna had another lover，Jane thought．Not just Dad．My poor，poor father!</p>
<p>男朋友！那么说安娜还有一个情人，简想，不止是我爸爸！我可怜的，可怜的爸爸！</p>
<p>‘Did you know them well?’the woman asked．</p>
<p>“你和他们熟吗？”女人问。</p>
<p>“No，not really，’Jane said．‘I just wanted to ……’</p>
<p>“不，真不熟。，简说，“我只是想……”</p>
<p>‘They were only here about three months，’the woman went on. ‘They weren't very friendly&middot;Never said good morn-ing or anything like that ．They were Irish，I think．Well，he was ．There's a lot of Irish around here．’</p>
<p>“他们才在这儿住了三个月左右，”那女人接着说，“他们不太友好。从不说早晨好或那一类的话。我想他们是爱尔兰人。对，那个男的是。这儿周围有很多爱尔兰人。”</p>
<p>Jane began to move away from the door，and the woman added，helpfully，‘perhaps your.friend will write to you．’</p>
<p>简开始往门远处走；那女人想带帮她，就又加了一句：“也许你的朋友会给你写信。”</p>
<p>‘Yes ．Perhaps．’Jane smiled at her and walked sadly down the street．</p>
<p>“是的，也许会，”简朝从笑了笑，而后惆怅地沿街走着。</p>
<p>So that was the kind — of woman Anna，Was．She probably never loved my father at all，Jane thought．How am I going to tell him? Poor Dad！Perhaps I'll just say that I posted the let-ter，and not tell him that I came to the house and found out about her.’</p>
<p>那么说安娜就是那种人。她可能从没爱过父亲，简想。我怎么告诉他呢？可怜的父亲！要不我只告诉他我已经把信寄了，不告诉他我已经来过面且知道她是个什么人。</p>
<p>But Jane wasn't very good at lying，and she didn't want to look at her father's sad eyes and tired white face．Let him hope for a few more hours，she thought ．I'll go home now and tell him something tomorrow.</p>
<p>但是简不太会说谎，而且她也不想着父亲那双悲伤的眼睛和那张疲惫而苍白的脸。让他再盼几个小时吧，她想，我现在先回家，明天再告诉他什么。</p>
<p>She hadn't been back to her flat since the bombing．‘She loved having her own home．It was only one big bedroom real-1y，with a small bathroom and a kitchen，But it was her own place；she could do what she liked there.</p>
<p>从爆炸事件后，她还没回过自己的公寓。她喜欢拥有自己的家。那仅是一间大卧室，外带一个小卫生间和一个厨房。但这是她自己的地方，她在那儿可以干自己喜欢干的事。</p>
<p>She shut the door，then took off her coat and threw it on the bed ．Then she heard the bathroom door slowly open be-hind her．She jumped round，her heart beating fast with fear， and saw a woman standing in the doorway！</p>
<p>她关上门，然后脱下大衣并把它扔到床上。接着，她听见卫生间的门在身后慢慢地开了。她跳转过身来，吓得心怦怦直跳，看到一个女人就站在门口！</p>
<p>‘Who the hell are you?’she screamed ．A thief，she thought. Jane had learned judo from her father; she knew what to do ．She grabbed the woman's arm and threw her to-wards the bed．But as the woman fell，she grabbed Jane's hair, pulling it forwards，to stop herself from falling.Jane screamed，and pushed a hand into the woman's face，harder and harder until her hair was free．Then she hit the woman in the face and the woman fell to .the floor．Jane stepped back，looked at her，and saw…</p>
<p>“你到底是谁？”她惊叫道。是个贼，她想。简跟父亲学过柔道，她知道该怎么办。她抓住那女人的胳膊，把她掷向床头。可那女人为了不摔倒，往下倒时抓住了简的头发，把它向前拉扯着。简尖叫着，伸出一只手去抓着那女人的脸，越来越使劲地抓着，直到她的头发被松开了。然后简一掌打在那女人脸上，那女人摔倒在地。简向后退了退，看了她一眼，并看到……</p>
<p>A man coming out of the kitchen．He had cold grey eyes and a thin hard smile and worst of all he had a gun in his hand．He said，‘Don't．’</p>
<p>一个男人从厨房出来。他有一双冰冷的、灰色的眼睛，脸上有一丝淡淡的、生硬的微笑，最糟的是他手里有一把枪。他说：“不要。”</p>
<p>Jane stood still，shaking．‘Don't what?’</p>
<p>简站在那儿一动不动，浑身发抖。“不要什么？”</p>
<p>‘Move．Or talk．Don't do anything．’The little black hole in the end of the gun watched her，like a cold eye．</p>
<p>“不要动。不要说话。不要做任何事。”枪端那黑洞洞的小枪眼注视着她，就像一只冰冷的眼睛。</p>
<p>The woman got up off the floor，pulled Jane onto a chair，and tied her hands behind her．Then Jane remembered that there were people in the other flats，and opened her mouth to scream．The man hit her in the face．</p>
<p>那女人从地上站起来，把简拉到椅子上，把她的手捆在背后。其时简想起别的公寓里有人，就张嘴喊起来。那男人打了她一个耳光。</p>
<p>‘Don't even think about it，’he said．He took a long piece of cloth out of his pocket and tied it twice round her head，covering her mouth and the lower part of her face．Jane felt her body shaking with fear．Who were these people? What did they want with her? She stared at the man's cold hard face，the woman's blue eyes and red-brown hair．She thought she had seen the woman before．But where?</p>
<p>“你想也别想，”他说。他从兜里掏出一个长布条，围着简的头绕了两圈，包住了她的嘴和下半边脸。简觉得自己的身体在吓得发抖。这些人是谁？他们要她干什么？她盯着那男人冷酷而生硬的脸及那女人蓝色的眼睛和棕红色的头发。她觉得以往见过那女人。可是在哪儿呢？</p>
<p>The woman tied Jane's legs to the chair.The little buck eye of the grin was only a few centf-her watched her and smiled. ‘ Just sit still and be sensible,little girl,’ he said. ‘Then perhaps. youll'live a few hours longer’</p>
<p>那女人把简的腿绑在椅子上。黑洞洞的小枪眼离她的脸仅几厘米远。那男人注视着她，微笑着。“老实坐着，放聪明点儿，小姑娘。”他说，“那样的话也许你还能多活几个小时。”</p><a href='3.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
