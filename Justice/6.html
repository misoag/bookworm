<p><b>6 隧道里 </b></p>
<p>AIan put dowli his coffee when the call came．He picked up the phone -with shaking hands．A voice said，‘Alan?’</p>
<p>来电话的时候，阿兰放下咖啡。他用颤抖的双手拿起听简。一个声音说；“阿兰吗？”</p>
<p>‘Anna，’Alan whispered．The policewoman went out of the door and spoke in a low voice on her radio．</p>
<p>“安娜，”阿兰小声说。那个女警察走出了门并用她的无线电对讲机说着什么。</p>
<p>‘Do you remember what I said yesterday，Alan?’</p>
<p>“你记得我昨天跟你说的吗，阿兰？”</p>
<p>‘Yes，’Alan said．`Please don't hurt Jane． Please. I haven't said a word to anyone．I promise you，Anna．’</p>
<p>“记得，”阿兰说，“请不要伤害简。求求你了。我什么也没对任何人讲。我向你保证，安娜。”</p>
<p>‘Good ．Not today，not tomorrow，not ever，Alan．Do you understand? Not if you want her to}stay alive．’</p>
<p>“好。今天，明天，水远也别说，阿兰。明白吗？要是你还想让她活着，就别说。”</p>
<p>‘Yes，I understand，Anna ．But I must speak to Jane．I must hear her voice，Anna．How do I know you haven't killed her already?’Alan's voice was shaking．</p>
<p>“是的，我明白，安娜。但是我必须和简说话。我必须听见她的声音，安娜。我怎么知道你还没杀她？”阿兰的声音在颤抖。</p>
<p>Anna laughed，gently，cruelly．‘We'll send you something，Alan ．In a day or two．If you're good．’</p>
<p>安娜笑了，那笑既温柔又冷酷。“我们会给你寄些东西的，阿兰。一两天之内。要是你乖乖的话。”</p>
<p>‘Anna，please.’</p>
<p>“安娜，求你。”</p>
<p>But the phone went dead，</p>
<p>但是电话断了。</p>
<p>Alan put the phone down slowly，and suddenly the room was full of voices．</p>
<p>阿兰慢慢放下电话，顿时屋里喧闹起来。</p>
<p>‘We've got it！A phone box in South Kensington Station，by the ticket office…，</p>
<p>“查到了！是从南堪星顿火车站的电话亭打来的，就在售票处旁边......”</p>
<p>‘Calling all cars in Kensington，calling all cars in Kensing-ton．A woman has just made a phone call from…’</p>
<p>“呼叫堪星顿的所有警车，呼叫堪星顿的所有警车。刚有一个女人打电话，在……”</p>
<p>The policewoman put her hand on Alan's arm.‘They'll be there in two minutes，’she said gently．‘They'll --&quot;</p>
<p>女警察把手放在阿兰的手臂上。“两分钟后他们就能到那儿，”她柔声说，“他们会—”</p>
<p>‘Take the there！’Alan said．‘Please！’</p>
<p>“带我去！”阿兰说，“求你了！”</p>
<p>The policewoman looked at Alm，then at the wheelchair，then back at Alan's white :face.‘All right.We've got“big van outside．We can get the wheelchair in that.&quot;</p>
<p>女警察看了看阿兰，又看了看轮椅，然后又把目光落回在阿兰苍白的脸上。“好吧。我们在外面有一辆大货车。我们可以把轮椅放在里面。”</p>
<p>As Jane came down the stairs，she realized two things：she was covered in blood，and Anna wasn't there．</p>
<p>简到楼下时意识到两件事：她浑身是血；安娜不在那儿。</p>
<p>The house was very quiet，and all the rooms were empty. But I can't go out all covered in blood，she thought ．People will think I've killed someone．</p>
<p>房子里很静，所有的房间都空着。但我不能以浑身是血的样子出去，她想，人们会以为我刚杀了人。</p>
<p>I have．But I had to，he was going to kill me．And he's. a terrorist．He killed five people，he and Anna...... I must get out before Anna comes back．</p>
<p>我是杀了人。可我不得不杀他，他要杀我。而且他是个恐饰分子。他杀了五个人，他和安娜… 我必须在安娜回来之前离开。</p>
<p>She found a man's coat，put it on，and went out into the street ．I should call a policeman，she thought．But she could only see ordinary men，women and children．She saw an underground station and walked towards it.</p>
<p>她找到一件男式外套，穿上，出去走到街上。我该叫警察，她想。可她看到的都是普通男人、女人和孩子。她看到一个地铁站，就朝它走了过去。</p>
<p>She went into the station，found some money in the coat pocket, and bought a ticket．I must find my father，，he thought，and tell him that everything's all right．Then she looked behind her and saw a woman coming out of a telephone box．</p>
<p>她走进车站，从外套口袋里找到一些钱，买了一张车票。我必须找到爸爸，她想，告诉他一切都好。这时她向后看了一眼，看到一个女人正从电话亭里出来。</p>
<p>Oh my God，she thought，it's Anna！</p>
<p>噢，天啊，她想，是安娜！</p>
<p>Jane walked quickly away from the ticket office，down the escalator towards the platform and the trains．Halfway down the escalator she looked back up behind her；</p>
<p>简赶快离开售票处，上了朝站台和列车方向下行的滚梯。半路上，她回头往上边看了看。</p>
<p>Anna had seen her! Anna was following her down the esca-lator!</p>
<p>安娜已经看见她了！安娜正沿滚梯向她追过来！</p>
<p>Quickly，Jane ran down。the bottom. and onto one of the olatforms．There was a train there，with its doors still open. She ran towards them，but as she ran ，the doors closed and the train moved away into the tunnel．Anna was now coming onto the platform behind her．Anna's hand was inside her coat and Jane was pure she had a gun．</p>
<p>简迅速地跑到滚梯底端，来到其中的一个站台上。那儿正好有一辆列车，门还开着。她朝车门跑去，可正跑着时车门就关上了，列车也走远了，进了隧道。安娜现在正来到她身后的站台上。她的手放在外套兜里，简敢肯定她拿着枪。</p>
<p>Why didn't I bring Kev's gun? Jane thought．But it was empty and I hate guns and it's no use thinking about that do I do now?now．What do I do now ?</p>
<p>我为什么没带凯夫的枪？简想。可它已经没有子弹了，我又讨厌枪，想什么也没用了。我现在该怎么办？</p>
<p>As the police van screamed through the London traffic，the policewoman listened in to her radio and passed the informa- tion to Alan．</p>
<p>警车从伦敦的行人车辆中呼啸而过，女警察听着她的对讲机，把信息传给阿兰。</p>
<p>‘Inspector Lee is on his way，’she said．‘There are six carsstation already and they're watching all the entrancesat the． Ah！Two detectives have seen a woman with red-brown hairgoing down the escalator......’</p>
<p>“李探长正在路上，”她说，“已经有六辆警车在车站，他们在注视所有的入口。啊！已经有两个侦探看见一个长着棕红色头发的女人下了滚梯…”</p>
<p>‘But the trains,’Alan said．&quot;She’U catch a treat...&quot;</p>
<p>“可是列车，”阿兰说，“她会上车的……”</p>
<p>‘They'll stop the trains as soon as they can．But there are hundreds of people in the station：The detectives could lie the woman in the crowds…’</p>
<p>“他们会尽快拦住列车的。但站台里有成百上千的人，警察们可能会在人群中失去目标……”</p>
<p>‘Please God，’whispered Alan．‘Let them catch her．’</p>
<p>“上帝啊，求你了，”阿兰小声说，“让他们抓到她吧。”</p>
<p>As Anna came towards her，Jane ran towards the end of the platform，then looked behind her and saw Anna running after her，her hand still inside her coat ．Quickly，Jane turned and ran towards another escalator，but there was a crowd of people there ．She looked again and saw Anna twenty metres behind．She turned round a corner，back onto another platform which was empty -- no people，no train．Anna will find me here in a second and shoot me，she thought．what now ?</p>
<p>安娜朝她过来时，简便跑向站台的尽头，然后回头看看，看到安娜正在追她，手还放在外衣口袋里。简赶快转身跑向另一个滚梯，但那儿有一大群人。她又看了看，看到安娜在她身后20米处。她转过一个拐角，回到另一个空旷的站台—那儿没有人，也没有列车。安娜马上会发现我在这儿并开枪打我的，她想，怎么办？</p>
<p>She jumped off the platform onto'the railway line，and ran into the tunnel．</p>
<p>她从站台上跳到铁轨上，跑进隧道里。</p>
<p>It was very dark in the tunnel.She knew that one of the lines was electric ．if I touch it，I'll die，she thought．The trains come every six minutes，and if a train hits me，I'll die too ．And there are only thirty centimetres between the sides of the train and the tunnel walls．</p>
<p>隧道里很黑。她知道其中的一条铁轨有电。如果我碰了它，就会死的，她想。列车每六分钟一趟，而且要是一辆列车撞着我，我也会死的。列车和隧道的四壁之间只有30厘米宽。</p>
<p>But there are holes in the tunnel walls every hundred metres，for workmen．I'll find one of those，wait for the next train and then go on to the next hole．It's probably only a kilo-metre to the next station．And perhaps Anna won't be sure which way I've gone．</p>
<p>但隧道墙壁上每100米就有一个给工人用的洞。我可以找到其中的一个，等下一辆列车过去，然后再挪到下一个洞。也许到下一个车站只有一公里远。也许安娜并不敢肯定我往哪个方向去了。</p>
<p>She ran on into the darkness.Once she fell，and her hands nearly touched the electric line．When she got up，there was a terrible noise，like a train coming ．But it was a train in another tunnel，not this one． She ran on，with one hand on the wall，looking for the hole．</p>
<p>她继续在黑暗中跑着。有一次她摔倒了，手差点儿碰到有电的铁轨。当她站起来时，传来一声可怕的巨响，像是一辆列车驶来了。但列车是在另一个隧道中，不是这个。她继续跑着，一只手扶在墙上，寻找着洞口。</p>
<p>Three minutes，four...... then she found it！A hole just big enough for one person．She got in and stood very still，waiting ．She heard the terrible noise again，this time froth the station behind her ．Then it stopped．The train will stop in that station for one minute，she thought.Then it will come east．</p>
<p>三分钟，四分钟……接着她找到了！--个正好可以容得下一个人的洞。她进去，一动不动地站在那儿，等着。她又听到一声可怕的气鸣声，这回是从她后面的车站传来的。之后，它停住了。列车要在那站停一分钟，她想，然后就驶过。</p>
<p>She laughed aloud ,in the darkness．Anna is still looking for me back on the platform．How angry she must be！</p>
<p>她在黑暗中放声大笑。安娜正回到站台上找我呢。她该多么生气啊！</p>
<p>A hand touched her arm．She screamed，‘What? Oh God，no！’The hand grabbed her arm，and pulled her out of the hole，into the dark tunnel．</p>
<p>一只手碰到了她的胳膊。她尖叫着：“什么？噢，上帝，不！”那只手拽着她的胳膊，把她从洞里拉到漆黑的隧道中。</p>
<p>‘Get out there！’</p>
<p>“出去！”</p>
<p>Two hands pushed her and Jane fell between the lines．She got to her knees，carefully，afraid of the electric line.Then the terrible noise started．The ground shook beneath her tee'and。white light came towards her，faster and faster ．In the light Jane saw Anna standing in the hole，witji, a gun to her hand．She jumped towards the hole but the train was coming faster，much too fast，and there was only room in the hole for one person，a woman with a gun…</p>
<p>两只手推了简一下，她摔倒在两根铁轨之间。她小心地跪起来，怕碰到有电的铁轨。这时，可怕的气鸣声又开始了。她脚下的地在颤动，一道白色的光冲她而来，越来越快。在亮光中，简看到安娜正站在洞中，一手拿着枪。她朝洞口跳过去，可列车正以更快的速度驶来，太快了，而洞中只容得下－ 一个人，一个拿着枪的女人……</p>
<p>When Alan arrived at the station，there were police cars everywhere, and crowds of people watchwoman helped him out of the van and he ing them ．The police-pushed his wheelchair through the ciowd，shouting angrily，‘What's happening? Where is she.?’</p>
<p>阿兰到车站的时候，那儿到处是警车，还有观看的人群。那个女警察帮他下了车， 他转着轮椅穿过人群，生气地高声喊道：“发生了什么事？她在哪儿？”</p>
<p>At the top of the escalator a policeman said，‘I'm sorry，sir．You can't go down．There's been a terrible accident.’</p>
<p>在滚梯的顶上，一位警察说：“对不起，先生。您不能下去。那儿出了严重的车祸。”</p>
<p>Then some ambulance men arrived．‘Where is -it?’they asked.</p>
<p>接着，一些救生员到了。“在哪儿？”他们问。</p>
<p>‘Down in the tunnel．Two woman -- a train's hit them，’the policeman said ．The ambulance men hurried down．</p>
<p>“在下面的隧道里。两个女人 -- 一辆列车撞了她们。’警察说。救生员赶快下去了。</p>
<p>‘What's happening?’Alan shouted．‘Which women? There's a murderer down there，a terrorist！And my daughter -- I've got to find my daughter！’</p>
<p>“出了什么事？“阿兰嚷道，“哪些女人？下边那儿有一个谋杀犯，一个恐怖分子！还有我女儿—我要见我女儿！”</p>
<p>He began to climb out of his wheelchair，but the policeman pushed him back．‘I'm sorry，sir．’</p>
<p>他开始往轮椅外爬，但警察把他按住了。“对不起，先生。”</p>
<p>Then the policewoman hurried up and explained．They helped Alan's wheelchair onto the escalator and went down． At the bottom Alan saw an empty train，and a lot of police at the end of the platform．The ambulance men talked to the police，and then went into the tunnel．Alan wheeled his‘chair slowly along the platform.</p>
<p>于是那个女警察赶快过来解释。他们帮着把阿兰的轮椅抬上滚梯，去了下边。在底下，阿兰看到一辆空列车和站台尽头的许多警察。救生员和警察说了说，然后就走进隧道。阿兰沿着站台慢慢摇着轮椅。</p>
<p>Then two of the ambulance men came.out of the tunnel．There was a young woman between them．She walked slowly，she was very dirty，and there was blood on the side of her face ．But Alan knew who she was．</p>
<p>这时，两个救生员从隧道里出来了。他们之间有一个年轻女子。她慢慢地走着，脏兮兮的，一边脸上挂着血。但阿兰知道她是谁。</p>
<p>‘Janie，’he said，‘Janie，Are you all right?’</p>
<p>“简妮，”他说，“简妮！你没事吧？”</p>
<p>Jane looked along the platform and saw him．‘Dad ? Why are you here?’She walked towards him shakily．</p>
<p>简顺着站台望去，看到了他。“爸爸？您怎么在这儿？”她摇摇晃晃地朝他走过来。</p>
<p>‘I came to find you，’Alan said．‘Oh God，Janie，what happened? Did Anna try to kill you? ’</p>
<p>“我来找你。”阿兰说，“噢，上帝，简妮，发生了什么事？安娜是不是想要杀你？”</p>
<p>Jane touched the blood on her face．‘Yes．She tried to shoot me but she missed．Then I. threw her in front of a train.I killed the other one，too．’She smiled，a strange，shaky smile．‘You said there was no justice in this life; didn't you，Dad? Well，those two terrorists murdered five people，and took away your leg and...... and now they're dead!So there is same justice，Dad，isn't there?’Then her eyes were filled with tears，and she sat down，suddenly，on a platform seat．‘That woman hated you，Dad，’she whispered shakily,‘real-hated you．’</p>
<p>简摸摸脸上的血。“是的。她想开枪打我，可没打中。然后我就把她扔到了列车面前。我也杀了另外一个。”她笑了，那是一种奇怪的、颤巍巍的笑。“您说过这世界不公道，不是吗，爸爸？可是，那两个恐怖分子杀了五个人，还夺走了您的一条腿，还…现在他们死了！所以，还是有一些公道的，爸爸，是不是？”那时她眼中充满了泪水，她突然一下坐到站台的椅子上。“那个女人恨您，爸爸，”她小声地、颤抖地说，。真的恨您。”</p>
<p>Alan wheeled his chair close to her and held. her hands in his．‘I'm so sorry，’he said.‘Anna hated everyone，not just me．But she doesn't matter now，Janie．You're alive！That's all that matters to me．That's all that matters in the world．’</p>
<p>阿兰摇着轮椅靠近她，握住她的双手。“对不起，”他说，“安娜恨所有的人，不止是我。不过，她怎么样现在已经无所谓了，简妮。你还活着！我只在乎那个。那就是这个世界上我唯一在乎的。”</p></body></html>
