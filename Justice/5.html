<p><b>5 “你们必须相信我！” </b></p>
<p>Then Alan phoned the police，Detective Hall came to Wthe hospital quickly，bringing an Inspector Lee with outside the door ．Then they came back in．</p>
<p>阿兰给警察局打电话后，荷尔警官立即来到医院，还带来了一位李探长。他们听了阿兰的叙述，然后在门外议论了一会儿。然后他们又折回走了进来。</p>
<p>‘OK，Mr Cole，’Inspector Lee said．‘Detectives are now searching the house in Bowater Gardens and your daughter's flat. I've informed the police at ports and airports too．It's possible that the kidnappers will try to take your daughter out of the country，you know．’</p>
<p>“好吧，科尔先生，”李探长说，“警官们正在搜索堡渥特花园和你女儿的公寓。我也已经通知了港口和机场的警察。绑架者很可能要把你女儿带出境外，你知道。”</p>
<p>‘Oh my God.’Alan held his face in his hands.&quot;She's probably dead．I'll never see her again.’</p>
<p>“噢，天埃”阿兰把手捂在脸上。“她可能死了。我再也见不着她了。”</p>
<p>‘Let's hope that's not true，’said the Inspector．‘Now，let's talk about this woman Anna again．Why do you think she's a terrorist?’</p>
<p>“让我们希望那不是真的吧。”探长说，“现在让我们再来谈谈这个叫安娜的女人。你为什么认为她是恐饰分子呢？”</p>
<p>Again，Alan explained．The visit to the Mews the evening before the bombing；the ten minutes when Anna was not with him；her phone call，telling him not to talk to the police or Jane would die．It was hard to speak iclearly because he was so angry and afraid ．He began to cry．‘It's加good，’he said．‘Jane's going to die．’</p>
<p>阿兰又解释了一遍。爆炸前一晚到了马厩；安娜有10分钟没和他在一起；她打电话叫他不许跟警察说，否则简就得死。由于这么生气和害怕，他很难表达清楚。他开始哭了。“没有用了，”他说，“简要死了。”</p>
<p>‘Try to keep calm，Mr Cole，’said the Inspector．‘You see，we're not sure that this Anna is a terrorist，We have already arrested the two men who put the bomb in the coach．In fact,one of them confessed to“this morning.The other one will confess soon.&quot;</p>
<p>“冷静些，科尔先生。”探长说，“你看，我们还没有肯定这个安娜就是个恐怖分子。我们已经抓了往马车里放炸弹的那两个人。实际上，其中一个已经在今天早上招供了。另一个很快也会承认的。”</p>
<p>‘But. 're..Ilr wrong people一they must be！If they are the murderers: Ay did AnnaPhone mg? Why is she saying she'll kill my daughter if I don't keep quiet about her?’</p>
<p>“可他们不是—肯定不是！如果他们是杀人犯，安娜为什么要给我打电话呢？为什么她说要是我对她的事不保持沉默的话，她就要杀了我女儿呢？”</p>
<p>‘Are you sure it was Anna's voice on the phone?’</p>
<p>“你肯定电话里是安娜的声音吗？”</p>
<p>‘Of course I am！And it was Jane's voice as -yell！I know my own daughter's voice，don't I?' Alan shouted．</p>
<p>“我当然肯定！而且还有简的声音！我能听出我自己女儿的声音，是不是？”阿兰嚷道。</p>
<p>‘Mmm，’the Inspector said slowly.‘Now，your daughter'.Was she unhappy to hear about Anna，do you think? Some-times daughters don't like,their fathers to have girlfriends，you know .Perhaps she was angry with you．’</p>
<p>“呣，”探长慢慢地说，“现在谈谈你女儿。你觉得她在听到安娜的事时不高兴吗？你知道，有时女儿不喜欢父亲有女朋友。也许她生你的气了。”</p>
<p>‘No．Not really．Well，perhaps a bit．’</p>
<p>“不，真不是。不过，可能有一点儿。”</p>
<p>‘I see some very strange things in my job，Mr Cole，and a lot of them are because of family arguments．It's just possible，you see，that your daughter hasn't been kidnapped at all: Per-haps she's angry with you and wants to stop you seeing Anna．Perhaps -- I've seen it happen before -- she's asked a friend to ring you and pretend to be Anna...’</p>
<p>“我在工作中碰到过一些奇怪的事，料尔先生，很多都是由于家庭纠纷造成的。你看，有可能你女儿根本没有被绑架。她可能只是生你的气，想让你不再见到安娜。也许—我以前见过这种情况—她让一个朋友给你打电话，假装是安娜…”</p>
<p>‘No！’Alan shouted．‘Jane isn't like that！She was fright-ened，I could hear it in her voice on the phone. ANNA HAS KIDNAPPED HER！You must believe me！’</p>
<p>“不！”阿兰叫道，“简不是那样的！她吓坏了，我能从电话里听出来。安娜绑架了她！你们必须相信我！”</p>
<p>At that moment another detective came in and spoke quietly to Inspector Lee，who immediately got up and left the room．When he came back，his face was serious．</p>
<p>那时另一个警官走进来悄声跟李探长说了几句话，李探长立即起身离开了屋子。他回来时脸上表情严肃。</p>
<p>‘The house in Bowater Gardens is empty，’he told Alan．‘The two people there left on the morning of. the bombing．We didn't find anything useful at your daughter's flat-- but we did find her handbag with her flat keys in' it. &quot;'It seems strange for her to go out without her keys，doesn't it?’</p>
<p>“堡渥特花园的房子空着，”他告诉阿兰，“那两个人在爆炸的那天早晨离开了。我们在你女儿的公寓没发现什么有用的东西—但我们找到了她的书包，里边还有门钥匙。她出门不带钥匙是奇怪，是不是？”</p>
<p>‘Where is she?’Alan whispered．‘Can you find her?’</p>
<p>“她在哪儿？阿兰小声说，“你们能找到她吗？”</p>
<p>‘If your daughter has been kidnapped，she could be any-where,’the Inspector said．‘Our only hope is that the kid-nappers call you again，and then we can find out where the call came from．We're fixing up a phone for you now，and there'll．be two policewomen here with you all night．If Anna does phone，keep her talking．Tell her that you have said nothing to the police，and ask to speak to Jane．Say you must hear her voice.’</p>
<p>“要是你女儿被绑架了，她可能在任何地方。”探长说，“我们唯一的希望是绑架者再给你来电话，那么我们就可以查出电话是从哪儿打来的。现在我们给你配一部电话，还会有两个女警察整夜陪着你。如果安娜真来电话，拖住她说话。告诉她你什么也没对警察说，’并要求跟简讲话。就说你必须听到她的声音。”</p>
<p>They put the phone on a table next to Alan's bed．He stared at it，saying to himself over and over again:</p>
<p>他们在阿兰床边的桌子上放了一部电话。他盯着电话，一遍一遍地默念着：</p>
<p>I must hear her voice．1 must hear her voice．</p>
<p>我必须听到她的声音。我必须听到她的声音。</p>
<p>They put Jane in a small bedroom，untied her feet，and took the bag off her head.But they tied her hands behind her back，and then tied them to the end of the bed．</p>
<p>他们把简放到一间小卧室里，解开她脚上的绳子，拿走她头上的袋子。但他们把她的手反绑在背后，然后又把她的手捆在床头上。</p>
<p>‘You'll stay here until those two men are sent to prison，’Anna said．‘Every day we'll send your father a picture of you with today's newspaper，to show you're still alive.’</p>
<p>“你要呆在这儿，直到那两个人被送进监狱。”安娜说，“我们每天都会给你爸爸寄一张你的照片和当日的纸，告诉他你还活着。”</p>
<p>‘Then what?’</p>
<p>“然后怎样？”</p>
<p>‘Then…we'll see．Perhaps，if your father is a good boy，we'll let you go，’Anna said．‘If you keep quiet too．’</p>
<p>“然后……再说。也许，要是你爸爸乖乖的，我们就让你走，”安娜说，“要是你也保持沉默的话。”</p>
<p>But Jane was watching Kev's face ．He won't let me go，she thought.Never．If I don't escape，I'll die here：</p>
<p>但是简注视着凯夫的脸。他不会让我走的，她想，水远不会。要是我不逃跑，我就会死在这儿。</p>
<p>When they had left the room，she lay in the dark，wonder-ing how she could escape．I don't want to die，she thought．And how terrible it will be for Dad if they kill me．And then there are those two innocent Irishmen，who will spend thirty years in prison for something they didn't .do．’</p>
<p>当他们离开屋子时，她躺在黑暗中，琢磨着怎么逃跑。我不想死，她想，而且要是他们杀了我，那么对爸爸来说该多糟埃还有那两个无辜的爱尔兰人，他们要为自己没干过的事坐30年牢。</p>
<p>That bastard Kev's going to kill me．I've got to try to escape．I just have to.</p>
<p>那个坏蛋凯夫要杀了我。我得逃跑。我必须逃。</p>
<p>For hours she tried to get free but it was impossible．The rope only hurt her wrists more. But at least she could move her hands，up and down the end of the old bed．Once，to-wards morning，she pulled the rope hard against the bed，&middot;but it didn't break．Instead，something cut her hand，and she had an idea．</p>
<p>她挣扎了几个小时想挣脱绳索，可都不可能。绳子只是把她的手腕磨得更疼。但至少她能在这个旧床的床头上下活动她的手了。有一次在将要天亮时，她使劲在床头来回拉绳子，可没弄断。反之，有什么东西划破她的手，于是她有了主意。</p>
<p>Could it cut the rope as well?</p>
<p>它也能划断绳子吗？</p>
<p>She moved the rope up and down across the end of the bed．It was very difficult because she couldn't see what she was doing ．Three times she cut herself，and there was blood on the rope．But by early morning，the rope broke，Her hands were free！What now?</p>
<p>她在床头上下磨着绳子。做这件事很难，因为她看不见自己做的。她有三次都划伤了自己，绳子上染上了血。但到清早时绳子断了。她的手自由了！现在怎么办？</p>
<p>She tried the door but it was locked．Downstairs，she could hear a radio，and she could smell coffee．So one of them，at least，was in the house．</p>
<p>她试着开门，可门锁着。她能听见楼下传来的<a href="http://www.tingvoa.com/html/20090114/443.html" target="_blank" class="infotextkey">收音机</a>声，还能闻见咖啡味儿。也就是说至少他们中的一个在这房子中。</p>
<p>Then she had another idea．She lay down on the bed and ar-ranged the rope around her wrists，behind her back．Then she screamed，‘Hey！You! 'Terrorist murderers！Come up here now！I'm thirsty！Get up here and give me a drink ！&quot;</p>
<p>于是她又有了主意。她躺到床上，自己背着手把绳子绕在手腕上。然后她大喊：“嘿！你们！恐怖主义谋杀犯！现在上这儿来！我渴了！上这儿来给我杯喝的！”</p>
<p>In a few minutes，she heard someone on the stairs．</p>
<p>几分钟后，她听到有人上了楼梯。</p>
<p>‘Breakfast，Mr Cole，’the nurse said．‘Eat up like a good boy，then you'll feel better．’She smiled .</p>
<p>“早饭，科尔先生。”护士说，“乖乖地吃完了，你会感觉好些的。‘她微笑着。</p>
<p>I'm not a child，Alan thought．Oh God，I'm a father who's lost a child！He pushed the eggs and tomatoes away，and．drank a cup of black coffee．</p>
<p>我又不是小孩，阿兰想。噢，天啊，我是个失去孩子的父亲！他把鸡蛋和西红柿推开，只喝了一杯清咖啡。</p>
<p>The policewoman in the armchair woke up and smiled brightly．‘Well，no one has phoned，Mr Cole．Perhaps your daughter has been to an all-night party and she'll be along to see you this morning。’</p>
<p>坐在扶手倚上的女警察醒来了，愉快地微笑着。“啊，没人打电话来，科尔先生。或许你女儿去通宵晚会了，今天早上她会来看你的。”</p>
<p>Alan stared at her hopelessly．He had not closed his eyes all night: So the police didn't really believe him．Perhaps they thought he had gone crazy because he had lost a leg．He stared at .the silent phone．</p>
<p>阿兰无望地盯着她。他一夜没合眼。’那么说警察并不真的相信他‘也许他们以为他因失去了一条腿而变得不正常了。他盯着那无声的电话。</p>
<p>Ring，damn jaou！Ring，</p>
<p>响啊，该死的！晌啊！</p>
<p>Kev came in，carrying his cup of coffee in his hand．He wasn't wearing a coat，so Jane could see the gup, under his arm.‘Stop making that noise,&quot; he said.‘Or you'll be sorry.’</p>
<p>凯夫进来了，手里拿着自己的一杯咖啡。他没穿外衣，因此简能看到他胳膊下的枪。“别那样吵闹了，”他说，“否则你会后悔的。”</p>
<p>Jane looked at him．‘You stupid little man，’she said softly, and as Kev stepped angrily forwards，she freed her hands from the rope behind her back and jumped at him&middot;With one hand she pulled his head down，and with the other she grabbed his cup and threw' the hot coffee into his face. Then she kicked him hard in the stomach．</p>
<p>简看着他。“你这个又傻又矮的家伙，”她轻声说；当凯夫生气地走上前来时，她从背后的绳子中抽出手来并扑向凯夫。她一只手把他的头往下按，另一只手夺过咖啡杯，把热咖啡泼到他脸上。接着她狠狠踢了他的肚子一脚。</p>
<p>‘Ah！Damn you ...’Kev fell onto the floor，trying to get the hot coffee out of his eyes．Immediately Jane jumped on top of him．Her knees, landed hard in: his stomach，and her fingers tried to get the gun under his arm&middot;But Kev's hand found the gun first ．Jane tried to pull it out of his hand，but he was too strong for her．With his other hand he hit her hard on the side of the head．</p>
<p>“啊！妈的……”凯夫摔在地上，想把热咖啡从眼中弄出。简一下跳到他身上，膝盖死死顶住他的肚子，试图用手指去够他胳膊下的枪。可凯夫的手先找到了枪。简想从他手上夺下来，可他对她来讲太强壮了。他的另一只手重重地打在她头的一侧。</p>
<p>Jane fell forwards．But as she fell，she put her head down and bit his nose until her mouth was full . of blood：He screamed，tried to pull his head away…</p>
<p>简向前摔了过去。但当她摔倒的时候，她低头咬住他的鼻子，直到她满嘴都是血时为止。他尖叫着，想把自己的头移开……</p>
<p>And let go of the gun．</p>
<p>他的枪掉了。</p>
<p>I've got it，Jane .thought．I've really got it！Then Kev hit her head again，hard，and she didn't know what was happen-ing ．She moved away from him，bringitfg the gun down to-wards her chest．Her head hurt terribly，and there was blood in her mouth，but all the time her fingers were trying to use the gun．</p>
<p>我拿到了，简想，我真的拿到枪了！这时凯夫又重重地打了她脑袋一下，而她浑然不知。她从他那儿挪开身体，将枪拽向自己的胸口。她的头剧烈地疼痛，嘴里是血，可她一直试着用手指搬弄着枪。</p>
<p>Why won't it shoot? she thought ．How do I make it work?Then as Kev hit her again，there was a BANG and another BANG and。third and。fourth.She didn't know what the bangs were but she held on to the gun as hard as she could acid there was a fifth BANG and a sixth…</p>
<p>怎么没射？她想。我怎么使它奏效啊？凯夫又打了她一下时，“砰”的一声，又一声， 第三声，第四声。她不知道这砰砰声是怎么 回事，可，她却使劲抓着枪。第五声，第六 声……</p>
<p>And then it stopped．She opened her eyes and saw that Kev wasn't hitting her any more．His hands had gone all soft and there blood coming ot of his face and his neck and his chest, there blood all over the floor and half of his head_ Was miaingI.Jane stood up,shaking.Where is Anna?she thought.</p>
<p>接着没声了。她睁开眼睛看到凯夫不再打她了。他的手松开了，血从他的脸上、脖子和胸口流出来，满地都是，而且他的半个头没了。简颤抖着站起来。安娜在哪儿？她想。</p><a href='6.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
