<p>‘Look！’Jane Cole said.‘ Here she comes now ! ’</p>
<p>“看！”简&middot;科尔说，“她来了！”</p>
<p>The two Americans looked along the street.There were crowds of people everywhere．In the middle of, the road，soldiers were riding towards them on horseback．Behind them came a golden coach，pulled by six black horses．</p>
<p>那两个美国人顺着街道看去。到处都是人群。马路中间，士兵正骑在马背上朝他们这边走来。在士兵们的后面，是一辆由六匹黑马拉着的金色马车。</p>
<p>‘That’s my father，’Janesaid．‘He's the coachman一the man driving the horses，’</p>
<p>“那是我父亲，”简说，“他是马车夫—就是赶马的人。”</p>
<p>The American woman said，‘Fantastic！Your father's driv-ing the Queen！Quick，Harry，use the video camera！’</p>
<p>那个美国妇女说：“真奇妙！你父亲正驾车拉着女王！快点，哈利，用摄像机拍下来！”</p>
<p>‘I am using it！’her husband said．‘But she's too far away．Can't we get a little nearer，Jane?’</p>
<p>“我正在拍！”她丈夫说，“可她离得太远了。我们能再离近些吗，简？’’</p>
<p>‘We can try，’Jane said．‘Follow me!’She‘took them nearer to the entrance to Parliament.&quot;This is where the coach will stop and the Queen will get out．Then she'll go upstairs to open Parliament for this year．’</p>
<p>“试试吧，”简说，“跟我来！”她带他们走得离国会大厦门口更近些。“马车就停在这儿，女王从这儿下车。然后她上楼去召开今年的国会会议。”</p>
<p>‘Didn't～～put a bomb under your Parliament once?，the American man asked．‘I read about that at school．Guy…something?’</p>
<p>“不是有人在你们的国会大厦下埋过炸弹吗？”那个美国男人问。“我在学校里读到过那事。是一个叫盖什么的人？＂</p>
<p>‘Guy Fawkes，’Jane said．‘In 1605．He tried to blow up Parliament，that's right ．But don't worry ．There's no Guy Fawkes here today．’</p>
<p>“盖&middot;佛克斯，”简说，“是在1605年。他想炸飞国会大厦，没错。但别担心。今天这儿没有盖&middot;佛克斯。”</p>
<p>She smiled at the Americans，She was a student，and this was her part-time job-to show tourists round London. She felt proud to show them her father，driving the Queen on a wonderful day like this．</p>
<p>她朝美国夫妇笑了笑。她是个学生，而 这是她的兼职工作－带游客们在伦敦观光。能指给别人看她父亲在像今天这么令人羡慕的时候给女王驾车使她很自豪。</p>
<p>Then the Queen's coach～past in front of them，the golden roof bright in the sunlight．</p>
<p>接着女王的马车从他们面前经过，金色的车顶在阳光下闪闪发光。</p>
<p>There were people everywhere，trying to take photos．Jane saw a woman with red-brown hair behind the American man，pressing the button of her camera．That's stupid，Jane thought，she can only see the backs of people's heads there．The woman shook her一angrily；there seemed to be something wrong with it ．The American～pulled Jane forward，laughing happily．‘Come on，’she said，‘let's get to the front！Use that video，Harry！’</p>
<p>到处都是想照相的人。筒看见在美国男人身后有一个长着棕红色头发的女人，她正按下照相机的快门。那样做可真傻，简想，她在那儿只能看到人们的后脑勺埃那女人生气地摇晃着照相机，照相机好像出了什么毛玻那个美国女人往前推着简，高兴地笑着。“走啊，”她说，“咱们上前边去！哈利，用摄像机拍一下！”</p>
<p>Alan Cole stopped the coach outside Parliament，and sat there，quietly holding the horses．A man opened the. coach door，and Prince Charles and the Duke of Edinburgh got out．Then the Queen got out．She was wearing a long white dress，and carrying a gold handbag．She walked slowly towards the entrance to the building．</p>
<p>阿兰&middot;科尔把马车停在国会大厦门前，坐在那儿，静静地把住缰绳。一个男人打开马车门，查尔斯王子和艾丁堡公爵走出马车。接着女王也走了出来。她穿着一件长长的白色连衣裙，手中拿着一个金提包。她慢慢走向大楼门口。</p>
<p>‘Excuse me，please，’the woman with red-brown hair said．‘ I must get closer．’She pushed、past Jane and held out her small black camera.</p>
<p>“劳驾，”留着棕红色头发的女人说．“我得靠近些、”她推开简往前走着，举着她那个黑色小相机。</p>
<p>‘Oh，all right，’Jane said．‘But，... my God ! ’</p>
<p>“噢，可以，”简说，“可是……天啊！”</p>
<p>There was a loud BANG！Jane saw a bright white light in front of her eyes，and felt a terrible hot wind on her face．The wind threw her backwards，and she fell to the ground with a lot of other people.For a moment she lay there，not thinking，not seeing．</p>
<p>“砰”的一声巨响！简看到眼前闪过一道白光，感到一股难忍的热浪扑面而来。热浪把她抛向后面，她和许多其他人一起摔倒在地。一时间她倒在那儿脑中一片空白，眼前一片漆黑。</p>
<p>Per eyes were open but she saw nothing．Only…blue sky．She heard nothing．Only…silence．Her body felt no pAin. But she could smell something. Smoke．</p>
<p>她睁开眼睛，可眼前除了蓝色的天空什么也看不见；耳边除了一片寂静什么也听不到。她感觉不到身体的疼痛，可她能闻到一股味儿。是烟味。</p>
<p>Smoke? she thought ．I don't understand．Why smoke? And this blue sky．Where am I?</p>
<p>烟？她想，我不明白，为什么会有烟？天这么蓝。我在哪儿？</p>
<p>Then the screaming began．</p>
<p>紧接着喊叫声开始响起来了。</p>
<p>The screaming was high and loud and terrible: It didn't sound human ．It went on and on and on．</p>
<p>这喊叫声又尖又响，很痛苦似的。真不像是人所能发出的声音。还又响个不停。</p>
<p>Jane～a hand in front of her，on the ground．A man's hand with blood on it．And broken glass．She moved her head and～broken glass everywhere，and blood，and bodies lying on the ground，She stood up slowly．</p>
<p>简看到眼前的地上有一只手。是男人的一只血淋淋的手。还有碎玻璃。她挪了挪脑袋，着到地上到处是碎玻璃、鲜血和尸体。她慢慢地站起身来。</p>
<p>For a moment she thought everyone was dead．There～bodies everywhere，but no～was moving． Then＆man ran across the road，and one of the bodies moved，The body wasn、human；it～a horse．As it moved，it screamed. The horse tried to stand up，but it couldn't，be－cause it only had three legs. There～blood all round the horse，and a big bit of wood in its stomach．</p>
<p>片刻间，她以为所有的人都死了。因为周围到处是躯体，但又都一动不动。接着一个男人跑过街道，而后又有个东西动了起来。</p>
<p>The Queen's coach was broken into a thousand pieces，and there were bits of wood and clothes and bodies everywhere.</p>
<p>动起来的不是人而是马。它一边动着，一边嘶鸣着。它想站，可站不起来，因为它只剩三条腿了。它浑身都是血，肚子上还插着一大块木头。</p>
<p>The bodies looked like broken dolls．</p>
<p>女王的马车被炸得粉碎，到处都是碎木头、破布条和碎尸块。那些尸体就像是破了的布娃娃。</p>
<p>&quot; Dad！&quot; she screamed．‘Oh God一my father！’</p>
<p>“爸爸！”简尖叫着，“噢，上帝啊—爸爸！”</p>
<p>She ran quickly towards the coach．A policeman with a bloody hand tried to stop her，but she pushed him away.</p>
<p>她赶快向马车跑去。一只手满是血的警察想拦住她，可她推开了他。</p>
<p>My father's over there！' she screamed．</p>
<p>“我父亲在那边呢！”她尖叫着。</p>
<p>&quot;At first she couldn't finch him．There were so many bodies一and so much blood！She，w the horse in the middle of a great lake of blood，trying to get up on its front leg．There was blood coming from the horse's nose and stomach一 and under the back legs，something that looked like…</p>
<p>开始她找不到他。这么多的尸体—而且这么多的鲜血！她看到正躺在一大片血泊中的那匹马，它正挣扎着想用前腿站起来。血从它的鼻子和肚子里流淌下来—而在它那黑色的腿下，好像有什么东西，是……</p>
<p>A body ．A man．‘Father！’</p>
<p>是一个人，一个男人。“爸爸！”</p>
<p>Alan Cole was covered with blood and his face was as white as paper．When he saw Jane，he opened his eyes and screamed．‘It's my leg！My leg一get this horse off me！’</p>
<p>阿兰&middot;科尔浑身是血，脸苍白得像一张白纸。他看到简时睁大眼睛，叫道：“我的腿！我的腿—把这马从我身上推开！”</p>
<p>His leg was under the back of the horse，‘which was moving wildly，trying to get up. Each time the horse moved，it fell on Alan Cole's leg，and he screamed．</p>
<p>阿兰的一只腿压在马背下，那匹马正疯狂地挪动着想站起来。马每动一下，都要压一下阿兰的腿，于是他直叫唤。</p>
<p>Jane ran and pushed the horse but it was too big，too heavy．She pulled its tail but that was no good．It tried to get up and fell on her father's leg again，twice．She could hear his bones breaking. Then a policeman came and held the horse's leg，Jane held its tail，and another policeman held Alan's arms．Jane and the first policeman pulled the horse to one side，while the second policeman pulled Alan free&middot;The horse screamed, eked Jane on the shoulder，and died.</p>
<p>简跑过去推那匹马，可是它太大，太重。她去拽马尾巴，可一点用都没有。它两次想要站起来，可又都摔在了她爸爸身上。她听见他的骨头都断了。那时，一个警察过来并抓住马的一条腿。简拽住马尾，另一个警察抓紧阿兰的胳膊。简和第一个警察把马拽到一边，第二个警察把阿兰拖了出来。那匹马嘶叫着，踢了简的一个肩膀一下，然后就死了。</p>
<p>Jane went in the ambulance with her father to the hospital．There were lots of people there．She heard a reporter talking on the telephone to his office．</p>
<p>简随爸爸上了救护车到达医院。那里有很多人。她听到一个记者正在给办公室打电话。</p>
<p>‘Five，’he said．‘Five dead，and about thirty are very bad1y hurt．It was a bomb一it must be terrorists. But the Queen is safe&middot;She was inside Parliament with her hush and Prince Charles and ．．．，</p>
<p>“五个．”他说，“五人死亡，大约三十人受重伤。是一枚炸弹—一定是恐怖分子干的‘。但女王安然无事。她当时在国会大厦里，与她在一起的有她的丈夫、查尔斯王子及……”</p>
<p>‘Never mind the bloody Queen!' Jane thought.‘ What about my father？’</p>
<p>“女王怎么样无所谓！”简想，“我父亲怎么办？”</p>
<p>The doctors took Alan away from Jane，and she had to sit and wait ．Her shoulder was hurt，but not badly．For nearly four hours she walked up and down，drank coffee，and thought：why?</p>
<p>医生们从简身边带走阿兰，她只好坐在那儿等。她的肩膀有些疼，但不很严重。大约有四个小时，她就这样走来走去，喝咖啡，思考着：这是为什么？</p>
<p>Why try to kill the Queen一how will that help anyone? Why kill tourists and soldiers outside Parliament? Why try to kill my father?</p>
<p>为什么要杀女王—那样对谁有什么好处吗？为什么要杀国会大厦门前的游客和士兵？为什么要杀我父亲？</p>
<p>Jane's father was the most important person in the world to her ．When he was a soldier, she had travelled around the world With him．He had taught her to climb mountains，win judo fights，ride horses，sail boats一he was a great father．Now，she thought，he may be dead．</p>
<p>对于简来讲，父亲是世界上最重要的人。在他当兵的时候简就跟着他周游世界。他教她爬山、柔道、骑马、扬帆开船—他是个了不起的父亲。现在，她想，他可能就要死了。</p>
<p>At midnight，a young Indian doctor came to see her．He ～tired and serious ．He looked at her sadly．</p>
<p>午夜，一位年轻的印度医生来看她。他看上去很疲劳也很严肃。他悲伤地看着简。</p>
<p>‘It's bad news，isn't it?’Jane said．‘Is he dead?’</p>
<p>“是坏消息，对吗？＂简间，“他死了？”</p>
<p>‘No，Miss Cole，’the doctor said．‘We have saved your father's life ．But I am afraid…’He hesitated．</p>
<p>“不，科尔小姐。”医生说，“我们已经救活了你父亲。但恐怕……”他犹像道。</p>
<p>‘Yes? What then? Please-tell me！’</p>
<p>“嗯？怎么样呢？劳驾—请告诉我吧！，</p>
<p>‘I am afraid he has lost his leg．It was too badly broken - we had to cut it off．’</p>
<p>“恐怕他的腿保不住了．伤得太厉害—我们不得不锯掉它。”</p>
<p>‘Oh my God！’Jane sat down suddenly．‘You cut his leg off!’She stared at the doctor and thought：Dad will never be able to climb or ride or sail again．Oh，poor man! It's than being dead!She began to cry．</p>
<p>“噢，天啊！”简一下坐在椅子上。“你们锯了他的腿！她盯着医生想：爸爸再也不能爬山，再也不能骑马，再也不能扬帆开船了。噢，可怜的人！这比死了还难受！她哭了起来。</p>
<p>“I'm very sorry，miss，’the doctor said．‘We had to do it，to save his life．He'll get an artificial leg．He'll learn to use it．At least he's alive…’</p>
<p>“实在对不起，小姐。”医生说，“为了救他的命，我们不得不这样做。他会安条假腿。他会学会用它的。至少他还活着……”“是19，我想是这样的。”简抬起头。“对不起，大夫。我确信你们已经尽力了。我现在能看看他吗？”</p>
<p>‘Yes，I suppose so.’Jane looked up．‘I'm sorry，doctor．I'm sure you did your beat．Can I see him now？’‘Yes，of course.The nurse will show you…’</p>
<p>“当然可以。护士会带你去……”</p>
<p>In the hospital bed，Alan Cole lay quietly．His face was as white as the sheets on the bed，but when Jane came in，he opened his eyes slowly．Jane took one of his hands in hers．The hand was cold，like ice.</p>
<p>病床上，阿兰’科尔静静地确着&middot;他的脸就像床单一样惨白。但当简进来时，他慢慢睁开双眼。简拉起爸爸的一只手。那手冰凉冰凉的。</p>
<p>‘Janie? Are you all right?’</p>
<p>“简妮？你没事儿吧？”‘</p>
<p>‘Me? I'm fine, Dad．And you're going to be OIL too，aren't you? The doctor told me．’</p>
<p>“我？我很好，爸爸。您也会好起来的，不是吗？医生告诉过我的。”</p>
<p>He closed his eyes，and for a long time he didn't answer.Perhaps he's asleep again，Jane thought．Then，very quietly，Alan Cole said，‘Stay with me，Janie．’</p>
<p>他闭上眼睛，好长时间没有回话。也许他又睡着了，简想。接着，阿兰&middot;科尔静静地说：“陪着我，筒妮。”</p>
<p>‘Of course，Dad ．I'm not going anywhere．’Jane sat down on a chair beside the bed．‘You sleep now ．’</p>
<p>“当然，爸爸。我哪儿也不去。”简坐在床边的一把椅子上。“您睡会儿吧。”</p>
<p>Her father closed his eyes，and the nurse smiled at Jane．‘Would you like a cup of tea，miss?’</p>
<p>父亲合上了双眼；护士朝简笑了笑。“你想要喝杯茶吗，小姐？”</p>
<p>‘Yes，please，’Jane said．‘It's going to be a long night．’She held her father's hand，and watched him sleeping．He looks. happy now，she thought．Like a baby．</p>
<p>“好的，来一杯吧。”简说，“这一夜长着呢。”她握住爸爸的手，看着他睡着的样子。他现在看上去很快活，她想，就像孩子一样。</p>
<p>But，what will he say when，‘fell him about the leg?</p>
<p>但是我跟他提起他的腿时他会说什么呢？</p>
<p>Next day，the doctor told Alan about his leg．Jane sat by the bed and held his hand while he listened．He didn'‘say anything，but tears came into his:eyes.，．</p>
<p>第二天，医生告诉阿兰他的腿的事情。他听到时简就坐在旁边握着他的手。他什么也没说，但眼中涌出了泪水。</p>
<p>‘I’m very sorry，Mr Cole，’the doctor said. ‘But we had to do it．Your leg was broken in forty places and you .lest a lot of blood．You're lucky to 1)e alive&middot;’</p>
<p>，实在抱歉，科尔先生，”医生说，“可我们只能这么做。你的腿断了40处，又失血过多。您能活下来已经是万幸了。”</p>
<p>‘Lucky！’Alan Cole said angrily，‘With this? Damn it，man，I'll never walk again！’</p>
<p>“万幸？！”阿兰&middot;科尔生气地说，“就这样？去他的吧，我再也走不了路了！”</p>
<p>`Oh yes，you will，Mr Cole．We'll get you an artificial leg．They're very good — they move like an ordinary leg&middot;No.one will see it under your trousers．’</p>
<p>“噢，不，科尔先生，你还能走路。我们会给你安一条假腿。非常好使—活动起来就像真的一样。在裤子底卞谁也看不出。”</p>
<p>‘And will I be able to ride horses with it，or swim，or climb mountains?’</p>
<p>“那样我还能骑马、游泳或爬山吗？”</p>
<p>‘Well，perhaps not…’ The doctor hesitated．‘We'll do our best for you，Mr Cole，believe me.Now，here's some-thing to help you sleep．‘You'll feel better later‘’</p>
<p>“这个嘛，也许不行……”医生犹犹豫豫地说，不过我们会尽力为你做的，科尔先生，相信我。瞧，这是助你睡眠的物事。你会感觉好些的。”</p>
<p>All day，Jane waited in the hospital．She drank tea，read newspapers; had a meal，and held her father's hand as he slept&middot;No one came to visit．Her mother was dead；and her brother lived in Australia ．At four o'clock her father woke up,and looked at her with big frightened eyes．</p>
<p>简一整天都在医院里等着。她喝茶水，读报纸，吃了顿饭，父亲睡觉时她就拉着他的手。没有人前来探视。母亲已经去世了，哥哥住在澳大利亚。4点钟时，父亲醒了，用惊恐的大眼睛着着她。</p>
<p>‘Janie?’he said.</p>
<p>“简妮？他说。</p>
<p>‘Yes，Dad．，</p>
<p>“我在这儿，爸爸。”</p>
<p>‘What happened? The doctor said there was a bomb，didn't he?And - I lost my leg ．But…I can't remember. ’</p>
<p>“出了什么事？医生说有炸弹，不是吗？还说我的腿没了。可是&middot;&middot;一我想不起来了。”</p>
<p>Very quietly，Jane told him what she had seen．Then she read the newspaper aloud．</p>
<p>简静静地告诉他她看到的一切，然后大声念起报纸：</p>
<p>Five people have died，and forty are in hospital．One man from the Queen's coach, lost a leg，and toe other three are dead．But the Queen，Prince Charles，and the Duke of Edinburgh were not hurt．Yesterday some Irish terrorists rang the <a href="http://www.tingvoa.com/BBC/index.html" target="_blank" class="infotextkey">BBC</a> to say they -exploded the bomb.‘We are sorry that ordinary people died，，they said．＿‘We meant to kill the Queen，not them．But accidents happen sometimes. 11he Queen was lucky this time，because the bomb exploded too late．But she has to be lucky every time．We only have to be lucky once．’</p>
<p>有五人死亡．40人住进医院。女王的马车上有一人失去了一条腿，另外三人死亡。但是女王、查尔斯王子和艾丁堡公爵没有受伤。昨天一些爱尔兰恐怖主义分子给BBC打电话说是他们引爆炸弹的。“我们对老百姓的死感到歉意。” 他们说．“我们本想杀死女王，而不是他们。但有时事情会出意外。女王这次走运了．因为炸弹炸得太晚了。可她得次次都走运才行．我们只消走运不失手一次就行。</p>
<p>‘My God！’Alan said．.' The bastards！Who…who died?’</p>
<p>“上帝啊！”阿兰说，“一群混蛋！谁…… 谁死了 ”</p>
<p>‘One policeman，a tourist，and three coachmen，’Jane said．‘You were the only coachman who didn't die．’</p>
<p>七个警察，一位游客和三个马车夫。”简说，“您是唯一活着的车夫。”</p>
<p>‘Oh no．’Alan's eyes were filled with tears．‘George，Bernard，John-dead！What harm had they ever done to the Irish，or to anyone? Why did the Irish have to kill them with their bloody bomb? There's no justice in this life，is there?’</p>
<p>“噢，不。”阿兰眼中满是泪水。“乔治、 伯纳德、约翰—死了！他们对爱尔兰人或对任何人有什么伤害？爱尔兰人为什么要用他们那该死的炸弹杀死他们？生活中没有公平，不对吗？＂</p>
<p>‘Well，perhaps the poe will…’Jane began.</p>
<p>“是啊，也许警察会……”简开腔道。</p>
<p>‘Yes，I hope they catch those murdering Irish bastards，I really do．I hope they lock them in prison until they die．That’s what I hope. By God,I do!’</p>
<p>“是的，我希望他们能抓住那些杀人的爱尔兰混蛋，我真这么希望。我希望把他们关在监狱里直到他们老死。那便是我所希望的。上帝啊，我多么希望能这样！”</p>
<p>‘Of course they will，Dad. ’‘Jane stroked her father's hand softly. ‘ The police are out there now，looking for the bombers.They'them before to long.’</p>
<p>“当然会的，爸爸。简轻轻抚摸着爸爸的手说，警察已经出动去搜查那些投炸弹者了。他们会抓住那些坏蛋的，用不了多久。”</p><a href='2.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
