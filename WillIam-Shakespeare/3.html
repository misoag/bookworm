<p><b>3 演员来到镇上 </b></p>
<p>Will married Anne Hathaway in November，and she came to live in Henley Street．John Shakespeare was pleased that his oldest son was married，but I don't think Will's mother wanted him to marry so young．Families cost a lot of money，and John Shakespeare was having a lot of money troubles in those days．Times were hard in Henley Street．</p>
<p>11月威尔和安&middot;哈瑟维结婚了，安就住进了亨里街。约翰&middot;莎士比亚见长子成家心里很高兴，可我觉得威尔的母亲并不想他这么早就结婚。结婚花了家里不少钱，再加上约翰&middot;莎士比亚那段时间财运不济，这样一来，日子过得有点艰难。</p>
<p>Susanna was born the next May．All babies look the same to me，but Will was very pleased with her．</p>
<p>次年5月女儿苏珊娜出世。对我来说，所有的孩子没什么不一样，但威尔欣喜若狂。</p>
<p>‘Look，Toby，she's got my eyes，’he said happily．‘She's going to be as beautiful as the Queen of Egypt，and as clever as King Solomon．’</p>
<p>“托比，你瞧，她的眼睛长得真像我，”他高兴地说着，“长大后，她会美丽如埃及艳后，聪明如所罗门国王。”</p>
<p>‘Oh yes？’I said．‘All parents talk like that about their children．I don't believe a word of it．’</p>
<p>“是吗？”我说，“所有父母都是这么说自己的孩子。我可不信。”</p>
<p>I didn't see much of Will's wife．I knew she didn't like me．To her，I was one of Will's wild friends，who got him into trouble．She came from a very serious，Puritan family．Lots of church-going，and no singing or dancing．</p>
<p>我不常见到威尔夫人，也清楚她不喜欢我。对她而言，我是威尔的一个粗野朋友，这种朋友只会让他出麻烦。她出生于一个虔诚的清教徒家庭，除了去教堂外根本不懂音乐和舞蹈。</p>
<p>Soon there was another baby on the way，and one evening in February 1585 I hurried round to Henley Street to hear the news．Will's sister，Joan，opened the door，and then Will came running down the stairs．</p>
<p>不久，又一个孩子要出世了。1585年2月的一个夜晚我急匆匆地赶到亨里街去打听消息。威尔的妹妹琼为我开了门，接着就见威尔跑下楼梯。</p>
<p>‘It's two of them！’he said．‘Twins！A girl and a boy．Isn't that wonderful！’</p>
<p>“一胎两个呢！”他说道，“是双胞胎！一女一男。真是妙极了！”</p>
<p>Will had some good friends，Hamnet and Judith Sadler，and he called the twins after them．John Shakespeare was very pleased to have his first grandson，and everyone was happy．For a while．</p>
<p>威尔根据好友哈姆奈特和珠迪丝&middot;塞德勒的名字给孪生子女起了名。约翰&middot;莎士比亚见第一个孙子出世，由衷地高兴，有一段时间，每一个人都很快乐。</p>
<p>Will and I still went around together when we could．He was still reading，and writing，and soon I could see a change in him．He was twenty-three now，and he was not happy with his life．</p>
<p>只要有机会威尔和我仍然经常来往，他依然读书写作，但是不久，我发现他变了。当时他23岁，但对生活不再知足。</p>
<p>‘Stratford's too small，Toby，’he said．‘Too slow．Too quiet．Too boring．I've got to get away．’</p>
<p>“托比，斯特拉福镇实在太小了，”他说道，“发展缓慢，生活宁静，日子又单调，我必须离开此地。”</p>
<p>‘Yes，but how？’I asked．‘You've got a family—three young children，remember．’</p>
<p>“是啊，可怎么离开呢？”我问道，“别忘了，你已经成家——还有三个孩子。”</p>
<p>He didn't answer．</p>
<p>他没有答话。</p>
<p>In the summer months companies of players often came to small towns，and in 1587 five different companies came．Will and I always went to see the plays．Will loved to talk to the actors and to listen to all their stories of London</p>
<p>夏天经常有剧团到小镇巡回演出，1587年分别来了五个剧团。威尔和我总是结伴去看戏。威尔爱找演员们交谈，听他们讲发生在伦敦的故事。</p>
<p>The Queen's Men came to Stratford in June，and we went to see the play．I don't remember what it was．I know that I laughed a lot，and that Will said it was a stupid play，with not a word of poetry in it．</p>
<p>6月“女王剧团”来到斯特拉福镇，我们又去看戏。这出戏的内容我已记不清楚，只记得当时看了直笑，但是威尔说这戏很糟糕，没有一句像样的诗歌。</p>
<p>‘Why don't you write a play yourself？’I told him．</p>
<p>“那你为什么不自己动手写剧本呢？”我告诉他。</p>
<p>‘Write a play？’He laughed．‘Anne would never speak to me again．’</p>
<p>“写剧本？”他大笑，“这样的话，安可再也不理我了。”</p>
<p>I didn't say anything，and Will looked at me and laughed again．</p>
<p>我不再说什么，威尔看看我又笑了。</p>
<p>It happened a few months later．I walked into the Shakespeares' kitchen one evening，and there was Anne，with a red，angry face，shouting at the top of her voice．</p>
<p>几个月后事情就发生了。一天晚上我走进莎士比亚家的厨房，只见安涨红着脸，气呼呼地，她高声在嚷着：</p>
<p>‘How can you do this to me？And what about the children—’Then she saw me and stopped．</p>
<p>“你怎么能这样对我？孩子怎么办？”这时她瞧见我就将话止住了。</p>
<p>Will was sitting at the table，and looked pleased to see me．‘I've told Anne，’he said quietly，‘that I'm going to live in London．I want to be an actor，and to write plays，if I can．’</p>
<p>威尔坐在桌旁，见我来很高兴。“我已经告诉安了。”他平静地说道，“我打算到伦敦去谋生。我想当一名演员，如果行的话，写写剧本。”</p>
<p>‘Plays！’screamed Anne．‘Acting！Actors are dirty，wicked people！They're all thieves and criminals！They drink all day and they never go to church—’</p>
<p>“写剧本！”安尖声叫起来，“去演戏！做演员既丢脸又龌龊，他们都是小偷和罪犯！整天只知道喝酒行乐，也从来不去教堂——”</p>
<p>‘Don't be stupid，Anne．You know that's not true．Listen．I'll come home when I can，but I must go to London．I can't do anything in Stratford．’He looked at me across the room．‘Are you coming with me，Toby？’</p>
<p>“别犯傻了，安。你知道事实并不是这样。听着，一有机会我就回家探望，但我非去伦敦不可。呆在斯特拉福镇我不会有作为的。”他看了看房间对面的我，“托比，你想一起去吗？”</p>
<p>‘How soon can we start？’I said．</p>
<p>“什么时候动身？”我说道。</p><a href='4.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
