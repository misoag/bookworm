<p><b>4 伦敦的新生活 </b></p>
<p>It's two days journey to London by horse，and Will talked all the way．His eyes were bright and excited．He was full of plans，and poems，and a love of life．</p>
<p>坐了两天的马车我们抵达伦敦，一路上威尔谈笑风生，双眼熠熠生辉，此时他踌躇满志，对生活无限憧憬。</p>
<p>‘I talked to one of the Queen's Men，’he told me．‘He said that he could find me work in the theatre．Acting，perhaps．Or helping to write some plays．I showed him some of my writing，and he was very interested．</p>
<p>“我曾和‘女王剧团’的演员聊过天，”他告诉我，“他说可以帮我在剧团找个活干，或许可以演戏，或者让我帮忙写剧本。我曾给他看过一些我的作品，他很感兴趣。”</p>
<p>When we rode into London，I began to feel afraid．This was a big，big city，and we were just two unimportant young men from a small town．I'll never forget the noise，and the smells，and the crowds．There were 200，000 people living in the City of London—I never saw so many people before in my life．</p>
<p>我们驱车进入伦敦城时，我开始感到心慌。这是很大、很大的一座城市，而我们只是两个从小镇来的微不足道的小伙子。城市的拥挤、喧嚣掺和着种种气味至今令我记忆犹新。伦敦市内生活着20万居民——我以前从未见过这么多的人。</p>
<p>We went down to the river Thames and saw the famous London Bridge，with all its shops and houses．Down the river was the Tower of London．Enemies of the Queen went into the Tower through the river gate，and mostly came out without their heads．</p>
<p>我们来到了泰晤士河，看到了著名的伦敦桥以及商店和住宅鳞次栉比。河下游便是伦敦塔，女王的敌人一旦从河上的闸门进了这座塔，几乎不能生还。</p>
<p>We found a small inn in Eastcheap，not too expensive，and had some bread，meat，and beer for our supper．</p>
<p>我们在东切普塞德街找到一处不太贵的小客栈住下，晚饭吃了几块面包、肉，喝了点啤酒。</p>
<p>‘Well，we're here！’Will said．‘At last！’</p>
<p>“哇，我们终于到了这儿！”威尔说道，“终于！”</p>
<p>‘Mmm，’I said．‘What do we do next？’</p>
<p>“是啊，”我说，“接下来我们干什么呢？”</p>
<p>He laughed．‘Everything！’</p>
<p>他笑道：“什么都干！”</p>
<p>The next day we began to look for work．</p>
<p>第二天我们便出去找活干。</p>
<p>Those early years were wonderful．We didn't have much money，of course，and we had to work very hard．A new actor only got six shillings a week，and there wasn't work every week．I decided not to be an actor．</p>
<p>在伦敦最初几年的情况很好。由于身边钱不多，我们工作很卖劲。因为新演员一星期只能拿到6先令的报酬，更何况并不是每个星期都能上台演出，最后我决定放弃做演员。</p>
<p>‘Why not？’said will．‘It's a great life．’</p>
<p>“为什么不干呢？”威尔说道，“这生活不是很好吗。”</p>
<p>We were working that month for the Queen's Men at the theatre called The Curtain up in Shoreditch．Will was acting four small parts in two different plays．He played a soldier and a murderer in one play，and in the other play he was a thief，and also an Italian lord in love with the Queen of the Night．And he loved it．</p>
<p>那个月我们工作的“女王剧团”正在滨渠街的“窗帘剧院”演出。威尔分别在两出不同的戏中扮演了四个小角色，在一出戏中扮演士兵和凶杀犯，在另一出戏中同时扮演小偷和一位爱上奈特王后的意大利勋爵，他很喜欢这角色。</p>
<p>‘I'm not clever like you，I said．‘I can't remember all those words．I forget who I am！I say the soldier's words，when I'm an Italian lord．I come on stage too late， or too soon．I stand in all the wrong places…’</p>
<p>“我不如你聪明，”我说，“我总记不住全部的台词。上了台又忘记自己演的角色！当我演意大利勋爵时我竟背出演士兵的台词。上台不是太迟就是太快，甚至会站错位置。”</p>
<p>Will laughed．‘What are you going to do，then？’</p>
<p>威尔笑道，“那你打算怎么办？”</p>
<p>‘Costumes，’I said．‘And properties．I had a talk with John Heminges，and he said they need a new man to help with all the clothes and the other things．’</p>
<p>“做戏装，”我说，“还有道具。我和约翰&middot;海明谈过了，他说剧团也正需要有个人能帮着安排戏装和其它事情。”</p>
<p>‘Yes，’Will said slowly．‘You'll be good at that．Now，I've got a fight on stage tomorrow，and I have to die with lots of blood．How are you going to get me some blood？’</p>
<p>“那好吧，”威尔慢慢地说道，“你会干好的。对了，明天上台我要参加决斗，并且最后要失血过多而死。你打算怎样弄到血呢？”</p>
<p>‘I've already got it！I smiled kindly at him．‘Sheep's blood I got it down at Smithfield market this morning．You can have as much blood as you want．I'm keeping it warm for you！’</p>
<p>“我早准备好啦！”我温和地笑道，“是羊血。今天早上我跑了一趟伦敦肉市场，你要多少血就有多少血。我会替你保管，不让它冻结。”</p>
<p>Will was good at acting．Not the best，but good．An actor had to do everything．He had to learn his words，of course—perhaps for six different plays at the same time． No theatre put on the same play every day．He had to dance，and sing，and play music．He had to jump，and fall，and fight．And the fights had to look real．The playgoers of London knew a real fight when they saw one．</p>
<p>威尔善于演戏。虽称不上最出色，但已算很好的了。做演员真不容易，事事都得干。最起码得学会背台词——有可能同时得背六出不同的戏的台词，因为戏院并非每天上演同一出戏。做演员必须会奏乐，能歌善舞，还要跳跃，摔跤和决斗。决斗必须看起来像真的一样，否则伦敦市内的观众一眼就可以看出真假。</p>
<p>John Heminges of the Queen's Men taught us both a lot．He was a good friend，then and for many years．</p>
<p>“女王剧团”的约翰&middot;海明成了我们多年的朋友，他教会我们俩许多东西。</p>
<p>I had a lot to learn，too．I learnt how to make shoes out of brown paper．How to clean the actors hats with a bit of bread．Then they looked like new again．I ran all over London to buy the best hair for the wigs．I learnt how to make fish，and fruit，and a piece of meat out of wood and coloured paper．</p>
<p>当然我要学的东西很多。我学会了如何用牛皮纸做鞋，学会了用一点面包洗掉演员帽子上的污渍，使帽子焕然一新。我要跑遍伦敦买到最好的头发制成假发，还要懂得如何用木头和彩色纸做成鱼、水果和肉片。</p>
<p>Will was busy day and night．I don't know when he slept．He was acting in plays，he was writing his own plays，he was reading books，he was meeting other writers，making friends…He was learning，learning，learning．</p>
<p>威尔夜以继日地忙碌，连我都不知道他什么时候睡觉。他不停地演戏、写他自己的剧本、看书，接触其他作家，结识新朋友……他一直在学习、学习、再学习。</p>
<p>One day we were having a glass of beer with Richard Burbage at the Boar's Head in Eastcheap．Burbage was an actor with Lord Strange's Men．He was very friendly with Will．</p>
<p>一天我们在东切普塞德街的公猪头酒吧同理查&middot;白贝芝喝酒。白贝芝是“斯特林奇大臣剧团”的演员，对威尔很友好。</p>
<p>‘You've written four plays now，Will，’he said．‘They're good，and you're getting better all the time．And I'm getting better as an actor all the time．Come and work with Lord Strange's Men at the Rose theatre on Bankside．You can write for us．’</p>
<p>“威尔，你已经创作了四个剧本，”他说道，“剧本写得不错，你的创作一直在进步，而我的演技也日益精湛。你就到‘斯特林奇大臣剧团’来，在河滨的‘玫瑰剧院’工作吧。你可以为我们写剧本。”</p>
<p>So we both went to the Rose．John Heminges came with us，and Augustine Phillips—he was a good actor，too．</p>
<p>于是我们俩都进了“玫瑰剧院”。一起过来的还有约翰&middot;海明和奥古斯丁&middot;菲利普——他也是个好演员。</p>
<p>We worked harder than ever at the Rose．Plays were always in the afternoon，because of the daylight．We had rehearsals in the morning，and by lunch-time people were already coming across the river to get their places for the play．And more and more people came．By 1592 London was hearing the name William Shakespeare again and again．</p>
<p>在“玫瑰剧院”，我们比以往更加努力工作。由于需要日光，我们上午预演，下午演戏。到了吃午饭时，人们已经陆续过河来占位子等候看戏，而且每次来的观众有增无减。时至1592年，威廉&middot;莎士比亚在伦敦已颇具名望。</p><a href='5.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
