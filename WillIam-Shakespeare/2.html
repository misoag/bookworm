<p><b>2 艾汶河畔的斯特拉福镇 </b></p>
<p>It was a sunny day in October 1579 when I first met Will，just outside Stratford，near a big field of apple trees．I saw a boy up in one of the trees．He had red hair and looked about two years older than me．</p>
<p>我第一次遇见威尔是在1579年10月的一天。那天，阳光明媚，就在斯特拉福镇外一座大苹果园附近，我看见有棵苹果树上坐着一位小男孩，长着红棕色头发，看模样大概大我两岁。</p>
<p>‘What are you doing up there？’I called．</p>
<p>“你在上边干什么？”我叫道。</p>
<p>‘Just getting a few apples，’he said，smiling</p>
<p>“摘苹果。”他笑着答道。</p>
<p>‘Those are Farmer Nash's apples，I said，‘and he'll send his dogs after you if he sees you．’</p>
<p>“那可是纳什农场主的苹果，”我说，“如果他发现了，就要放狗咬你的。”</p>
<p>‘Mr Nash has gone to market，’the boy said．‘Come on！They're good apples．’</p>
<p>“纳什先生去集市了，”男孩说道，“来吧！苹果不错。”</p>
<p>The next minute I was up the tree with him．But Will was wrong．Farmer Nash wasn't at the market，and a few minutes later we saw his angry red face above the wall on the far side of the field．</p>
<p>一会儿我也上了树。但是威尔错了，纳什先生并没去集市，几分钟后我们看见果园那端墙头露出一张气得发红的脸。</p>
<p>Will and I ran like the wind and only stopped when we reached the river．We sat down to eat our apples．</p>
<p>威尔和我见势撒腿就跑，一口气跑到河边才坐下来吃苹果。</p>
<p>Will was fifteen，and lived in Henley Street，he told me．His father was John Shakespeare，and he had a sister，Joan，and two younger brothers，Gilbert and Richard．There was another sister who died，I learnt later．And the next year he had another brother，little Edmund—the baby of the family．</p>
<p>威尔告诉我，他15岁，住在亨里街。家中有父亲约翰&middot;莎士比亚，妹妹琼和两个弟弟，吉尔伯特和理查。我后来听说他另有一位姐姐死了。第二年他又添了一个弟弟——威尔家的赤子小埃德蒙。</p>
<p>‘Now，what about you？’he asked．</p>
<p>“那么你呢？”他问道。</p>
<p>‘There's only me and my sister，’I said．‘My parents are dead，and we live with my mother's brother：He's a shoe-maker in Ely Street and I work for him．What do you do？’</p>
<p>“家里只有我和姐姐，”我说，“父母死后我们住在舅舅家。他是埃利街的一个鞋匠，我为他打工。你现在干什么？”</p>
<p>‘I go to Mr Jenkins' school in Church Street，’Will said．‘Every day，from seven o'clock until five o'clock．Not Sundays，of course．’</p>
<p>“我在教堂街詹金斯先生的学校就读，”威尔说，“每天从上午7点到下午5点上学，当然不包括星期天。”</p>
<p>I was sorry for him．‘Isn't is boring？’I asked．</p>
<p>我真为他难过。“这难道不乏味吗？”我问道。</p>
<p>‘Sometimes．Usually it's all right．’He lay back and put his hands behind his head．‘But we have to read and learn all these Latin writers．I want to read modern writers，and Eng-lish writers，like Geoffrey Chaucer．Can you read？’he asked．</p>
<p>“偶尔有这种感觉，不过通常觉得学校的生活也不错。”他仰身躺下，双手枕着头，“在学校，我们不得不学习所有那些拉丁作家的作品。可我只想<a href="http://www.tingvoa.com/English_News/" target="_blank" class="infotextkey">阅读</a>现代作家和英国作家的作品，比如杰弗利&middot;乔叟。你会看书吗？”他问道。</p>
<p>‘Of course I can read！’I said．‘I went to school．’</p>
<p>“当然会啦！”我说，“我上过学。”</p>
<p>Will sat up and began to eat another apple．‘I want to be a writer，’he said．‘A poet．I want that more than anything in the world．’</p>
<p>威尔坐起来又吃了一个苹果。“我想成为作家，”他继续说道，“诗人。世上再没有比这更令我神往的。”</p>
<p>We were friends from that day，until the day he died．We met nearly every day，and he taught me a lot about books and poetry and writers．He always had his nose in a book．</p>
<p>自那天起我们就成了莫逆之交，直到他过世。我们几乎每天见面，他教了我许多书本和文学上的知识。他总是埋头博览群书。</p>
<p>When Will left school，he worked for his father in Henley Street．John Shakespeare was a glove-maker，and he had other business too，like buying and selling sheep．But Will wasn't interested．</p>
<p>威尔离开学校后就在亨里街帮助父亲料理生意。约翰&middot;莎士比亚是一位手套工匠，同时经营其他生意，如羊的买卖生意。但威尔对做生意却不感兴趣。</p>
<p>‘What are we going to do，Toby？’he said to me one day．‘We can't spend all our lives making shoes and gloves！’</p>
<p>“托比，接下来你有何打算？”有一天他问我。“我们不能一辈子都做鞋和做手套吧！”</p>
<p>‘Well，’I said，‘we could run away to sea and be sailors．Sail round the world，like Francis Drake．</p>
<p>“对呀，”我说，“我们跑到海上当海员会，像弗朗西斯&middot;杜雷克一样环绕地球航行。”</p>
<p>Drake sailed back to Plymouth in 1581，after his three-year journey round the world，but we were still in Stratford．We made lots of plans，but nothing ever came of them．</p>
<p>杜雷克在环绕地球航行三年后于1581年回到普利茅斯，可我们还是呆在斯特拉福镇。尽管也制定了种种计划，但始终未付诸行动。</p>
<p>Will was still reading a lot and he was already writing poems himself．He sometimes showed them to me，and I said they were very good．I didn't really know anything about poetry then，but he was my friend．</p>
<p>这段时间威尔依然博览群书并开始自己写诗，偶尔给我看他写的诗。虽然嘴上我都说他的诗写得好，实际上我对诗歌是一窍不通。只不过他是我的好友我才这么说而已。</p>
<p>Will was not happy with his writing．‘I've got so much to learn，Toby，’he said．‘So much to learn．’</p>
<p>威尔对自己的诗歌并不满意。“托比，我要学的东西太多了。”他说，“实在太多了。”</p>
<p>Poor Will．He had a lot to learn about women，too．One day in October 1582 he came to my house with a long face．</p>
<p>可怜的威尔。他还得学会了解每个人。1582年10月的一天他来到我的住处，神情沉郁。</p>
<p>‘I'll never leave Stratford．’he said．</p>
<p>“我永远不能离开斯特拉福镇了。”他说。</p>
<p>‘Why not？’I asked．‘We'll get away one day．You'll see．’</p>
<p>“为什么不能？”我问道，“总有一天我们会离开此地。你等着瞧。”</p>
<p>‘Perhaps you will，’he said，‘but I'm going to be married in a few weeks' time．To Anne Hathaway．’</p>
<p>“或许你还行，”他说，“但过几个星期我就要结婚了。同安&middot;哈瑟维结婚。”</p>
<p>My mouth fell open and stayed open．‘Married！To Anne Hathaway？Is that the Hathaways over at Shottery？’</p>
<p>一听此言我张着嘴愣了好久。“结婚。同安&middot;哈瑟维结婚？你是说肖特雷邻乡哈瑟维家的女儿？”</p>
<p>‘Yes，’Will said．I was working on some shoes on the table，and Will picked one up and looked at it．</p>
<p>“没错，”威尔说。当时我在做鞋，威尔拿起桌上一支鞋，看看。</p>
<p>‘Well，er，she's a fine girl，of course，’I said uncomfort-ably．‘But…but，Will，she's twenty-six and you're only eighteen！’</p>
<p>“当然，嗯，她是个好姑娘，”我同情地说道，“不过……不过，威尔，她已经26岁了，你才18岁呀！”</p>
<p>‘I know，’Will said．‘But I've got to marry her．’</p>
<p>“我知道，”威尔说，“但是我非娶她不行。”</p>
<p>‘Oh no！’I said．‘You mean，she's…’</p>
<p>“哦，不可能这样吧！”我说，“你是说，她已经……”</p>
<p>‘That's right，’said Will．‘In about six months' time I'm going to be a father．’</p>
<p>“你猜对了，”威尔说道，“再过6个月我就要当爸爸了。”</p><a href='3.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
