<p><b>3 给匹普的一次机会 </b></p>
<p>I always knew I would be apprenticed to Joe as soon as I was old enough，and so I used to spend most of the day helping him in the forge．However，I also attended the village evening school，which was organized by an ancient relation of Mr Wopsle's．Her teaching mostly consisted of falling asleep while we children fought each other，but Mr Wopsle's young cousin，Biddy，tried to keep us under control and teach us to read，write and count．Mr Wopsle‘examined’us every three months．In fact he did not ask us any questions at all，but read aloud from Shakespeare，waving his arms dramatically and enjoying the sound of his own voice．</p>
<p>我总是想，一到学徒的年龄，我就做乔的徒弟。因此，我常常在锻炉前，白天花费大部分时间帮助乔干活。但是，我也参加村办夜校，这所学校是由伍甫赛先生的一位远房亲戚创办的。她的教学主要是由睡觉、孩子们相互打闹而组成。但是，伍甫赛先生的表妹，毕蒂，设法把我们控制住，教我们读、写和算术。伍甫赛先生每三个月就“考”我们一次。事实上，他什么问题也不问我们，只是挥动着双臂，用他那特有的激动人心、兴高采烈的声调，大声朗读莎士比亚的作品。</p>
<p>One night，about a year after the escaped convicts had been caught，I was sitting by the kitchen fire，writing a letter to Joe．I didn't need to，because he was sitting right next to me，but I wanted to practise my writing．After an hour or two of hard work，I passed this letter to him．</p>
<p>一天晚上，这大约是两个逃犯被捕的一年以后，我正在厨房火炉旁坐着，给乔写封信，我并不需要这样做，因为他就紧靠在我旁边坐着。但是，我是想锻炼我的写作。经过一两小时的努力后，我把这封信递给他：</p>
<p>‘Pip，old boy！’cried Joe，opening his kind blue eyes very wide．‘What a lot you've learnt！Here's a J and an O，that's for Joe，isn't it，Pip？’</p>
<p>“亲爱的乔，我希望你很好，马上我就能把我所学的东西教给你，多么可爱的乔，爱你的匹普”“匹普，好小子！”乔喊着，睁大他那仁慈的蓝眼睛，“你学了这么多了！这儿是一个J和O，这是乔字，对吗，匹普？”</p>
<p>I wondered whether I would have to teach Joe from the beginning，so I asked，‘How do you write Gargery，Joe？’</p>
<p>我不知道是否必须从头教乔，所以，我问道，“你写出葛吉瑞。乔，怎么样？”</p>
<p>‘I don't write it at all，’said Joe．‘But，you know，I am fond of reading．Give me a good book or newspaper，a good fire and I ask no more．Well！When you come to a J and an O，how interesting reading is！’</p>
<p>“我一点也不会写，”乔说，“但是，你知道，我爱好读，给我一本好书或者报纸，一盆炉火，不要更多。喂！当你写出一个J和O，读它多么有趣呀！”</p>
<p>‘ Didn't you ever go to school，Joe，when you were young？’</p>
<p>“乔，你小时候未曾上过学？”</p>
<p>‘No，Pip．You see，my father drank a lot，and when he drank，he used to hit my mother，and me too，sometimes．So she and I ran away from him several times．And she used to say，“Now，Joe，you can go to school．”But my father had such a good heart that he didn't want to be without us．So he always came to find us，and took us home，and hit us．So you see，Pip，I never learnt much．’</p>
<p>“没有，匹普，你知道，我爸爸酗酒，当他酗酒时，常打我妈妈，有时候也打我。因此，她和我几次逃离他，她过去对我说，‘唉，乔，你能上学了。’可是，我爸爸有如此的好心，他不能没有我们。因此，他总是来找我们，并把我们带回家，继续揍我们。这样你就明白了，匹普，我一点也没学习过。”</p>
<p>‘Poor Joe！’</p>
<p>“可怜的乔！”</p>
<p>‘But remember，Pip，my father had a good heart．’</p>
<p>“但是记住，匹普，我爸爸有一副好心肠。”</p>
<p>I wondered about that，but said nothing．</p>
<p>这话让我惊奇，但是没说什么。</p>
<p>‘He let me become a blacksmith，which was his job too，only he never worked at it．I earned the money for the family，until he died．And listen to this，Pip，I wanted to put this on his gravestone：</p>
<p>“他让我当了一名铁匠，铁匠也是他的工作，只是他从来不干这活。直到他死，都是我为家里挣钱。听着这一点，匹普，在他的墓碑上我要这样写：</p>
<p>Whatever the fault he had from the start，</p>
<p>无论怎样的过失，他是创家立业的。</p>
<p>Remember，reader，he had a good heart．’</p>
<p>记住，读者，他有一颗好心。”</p>
<p>‘ Did you invent that yourself，Joe？’I asked，surprised .</p>
<p>“乔，你自己想出来的吗？”我惊讶地问道。</p>
<p>‘I did，’said Joe proudly．‘It came to me in a moment．From my own head．But，Pip，sad to say，there wasn't enough money for the gravestone．My poor mother needed it．In bad health，she was．She died soon after．Found peace at last．’Joe's blue eyes were watery．‘I was lonely then，and I met your sister．Now，Pip，’Joe looked firmly at me，because he knew I was not going to agree with him，‘your sister is a fine woman！’</p>
<p>“就是我，”乔自豪地说，“从我自己头脑里不加思索地出来了。但是，匹普，悲哀地说，我没有足够的钱去立这块墓碑。我可怜的妈妈需要钱，她身体不好。不久，她就离开了人间，最后找到了安宁。”乔的蓝眼睛湿润了。“我从此孤独一人。后来，我认识了你姐姐，匹普，”乔紧紧地盯着我。因为他知道我不会赞成他的，“你姐姐是个好女人！”</p>
<p>I could think of nothing better to say than‘I'm glad you think so，Joe．’</p>
<p>我想不出比这更好的语言“我很高兴你这样想，乔。”</p>
<p>‘ So am I，’said Joe．‘I'm glad I think so．Very kind of her，bringing you up by hand．Such a tiny baby you were！So when I offered to marry your sister，I said，“And bring the poor little child to live with us．There's room for him at the forge！”’</p>
<p>“彼此，彼此，”乔说，“我很高兴这样想，她太仁慈了，亲手把你带大，你是这么小小的婴儿！当时，我向你姐提出结婚，我说，‘带着这个可怜的小孩子和我们一起生活吧，在锻工车间里有间屋子给他！’”</p>
<p>I put my arms round Joe's neck and cried into his shirt．</p>
<p>我搂着乔的脖子，啼哭着，泪水湿透他的衬衫。</p>
<p>‘Don't cry，old boy！’he said．‘Always the best of friends，you and me！’ As I dried my tears，he continued，‘So here we are，Pip！Now if you teach me a bit（and I warn you now that I'm very stupid）Mrs Joe must never know．And why？Because she likes to be-in charge-you know-giving the orders．’</p>
<p>“不要哭，老伙计！”他说，“你和我永远是最好的朋友！”当我擦干眼泪，他继续说，“我们就在这儿，匹普！现在你如果教我一点儿（我提醒你，我很笨），决不能让乔夫人知道。为什么呢？因为她喜欢——下命令——你知道——就是发号施令。”</p>
<p>‘Joe，’I asked，‘why don't you ever rebel？’</p>
<p>“乔，”我问道，“你为什么不反抗呢？”</p>
<p>‘Well，’said Joe，‘ to start with，your sister's clever．And I'm not．And another thing，and this is serious，old boy，when I think of my poor mother's hard life，I'm afraid of not behaving right to a woman．So I'd much rather seem a bit weak with Mrs Joe than shout at her，or hurt her，or hit her．I'm just sorry she scolds you as well，Pip，and hits you with the stick．I wish I could take all the scolding myself．But there it is，Pip．’</p>
<p>“唉，”乔说，“首先，你姐姐聪明，而我不行。另一方面，这一点是重要的，老伙计，每当想起我可怜的妈妈苦难的生活，我害怕对女人采取不良的行为。因为，我必须对乔太太软弱一点儿，不能高声呼喊她、伤害她和打她。我很抱歉，她也责骂你，匹普，用棍子打你，我希望全部的责骂由我一人承担。可是，不现实，匹普。”</p>
<p>Just then we heard the sound of a horse on the road．Mrs Joe and Uncle Pumblechook were returning from market．The carriage arrived，and in a rush of cold air，they were in the kitchen．</p>
<p>正在这时，我们听到路上的马蹄声，乔夫人和潘波趣舅舅赶集回来了。马车一到，冲进一股冷风，他们进了厨房。</p>
<p>‘Now，’said Mrs Joe，excitedly throwing off her cloak，‘if this boy isn't grateful tonight，he never will be！’</p>
<p>“嘿，”乔夫人说，激动地脱掉她的斗篷，“如果这孩子今晚不感恩的话，那他就是一个忘恩负义的家伙！”</p>
<p>‘She's offering the boy a great opportunity，’agreed Pumblechook．Trying to look grateful，I looked at Joe，making the word‘She？’with my lips．He clearly did not know either．</p>
<p>“她给这孩子提供了一个很好的机会，”潘波趣应和着说。我尽力表现出一副感恩的样子看着乔，随口吐出个字“她？”，他也不明白什么意思。</p>
<p>‘You were speaking of a she？’he said Politely to them．</p>
<p>“你们正在谈论她？”他有礼貌地对他们说。</p>
<p>‘She is a she，I suppose，’Mrs Joe replied crossly．‘Unless you call Miss Havisham a he．And even you wouldn't do that．’</p>
<p>“我想像的，她就是她呗，”乔夫人不高兴地回答，“你总不能把郝薇香小姐叫他吧，即使你也不会这样叫吧。”</p>
<p>‘The rich Miss Havisham who lives all alone in the big house in town？’asked Joe．</p>
<p>“在镇上，独住一幢大宅里腰缠万贯的郝薇香小姐吗？”乔问道。</p>
<p>‘There aren't any other Miss Havishams that I know of！She wants a boy to go and play there．She asked Uncle Pumblechook if he knew of anyone．And Uncle Pumblechook，thinking of us as he always does，suggested this boy．And what's more，Uncle Pumblechook，realizing that this boy's fortune may be made by going to Miss Havisham's，has of-fered to take him into town tonight in his carriage，and let him sleep in his own house，and deliver him tomorrow to Miss Havisham's．And just look！’she cried，catching hold of me．‘Look at the dirt on this by！’</p>
<p>“我所知道的没有第二个郝薇香小姐！她想要一个孩子到她那儿去玩玩。她问起潘波趣舅舅是否有认识的小孩子，潘波趣舅舅总是先想到我们，提到了这个孩子。还有，潘波趣舅舅认识到郝薇香小姐可以给这个孩子带来好运。所以，今天晚上，用他的马车带他到镇上，让他睡在潘波趣舅舅家里，明天把他送到郝薇香小姐家里。瞧！”她抓着我喊了起来，“看看这个脏孩子！”</p>
<p>I was washed from top to toe in Mrs Joe's usual violent manner，and handed over，in my tightest Sunday clothes，to Mr Pumblechook．In the carriage taking me into town，I cried a little．I had never been away from Joe before，and I had no idea what was going to happen to me at Miss Havisham's．</p>
<p>乔夫人以常用的粗暴手法给我从头到脚洗了洗澡，给我穿上最好的衣服，把我交给潘波趣先生。我小声哭着，上了马车到了镇上。以前我从来没有离开乔，对我来讲，在郝薇香小姐家将会发生什么，我不敢想。</p>
<p>Mr Pumblechook seemed to agree with my sister that I should be punished as much as possible，even when eating，and so for breakfast next morning he gave me a large piece of bread with very little butter，and a cup of warm water with very little milk，and insisted on checking my learning．</p>
<p>潘波趣先生似乎赞成我姐姐想尽一切办法要惩罚的做法，甚至在吃饭时也不放过。所以，第二天吃早饭，他给我一大块面包，夹了一点点黄油，一杯温水加很少一点牛奶，并坚持检查我的学习。</p>
<p>‘What's seven and thirteen，boy？’He continued testing me all through breakfast．‘And nine？And eleven？’</p>
<p>“7加13得几，孩子？”整个早餐中，他不断地考我，“加9？加 11？”</p>
<p>So I was glad to arrive at Miss Havisham's house at about ten o’clock．It was a large house，made of old stone，and with iron bars on the windows．We rang the bell，and waited at the gate．Even then Mr Pumblechook said，‘And fourteen？’but I pretended not to hear him．Then a young lady came to open the gate，and let me in．Mr Pumblechook was following me when she stopped him．</p>
<p>大约10点时分，到达郝薇香小姐家，我很高兴。那是一座宽大的住宅，用旧石所砌，窗户架有铁栏杆。我们按了门铃后，在门口耐心等候，潘波趣先生连这时也不放过，说：“加14？”不过，我假装没听见他说的什么。接着，一位年轻的小姐过来打开了门，让我进去。潘波趣先生想跟着我进来，却被她阻止了。</p>
<p>‘Do you wish to see Miss Havisham？’she asked．</p>
<p>“你想见郝薇香小姐吗？”她问道。</p>
<p>‘If Miss Havisham wishes to see me，’answered Mr Pumblechook，a little confused．</p>
<p>“如果郝薇香小姐想见我，”潘波趣先生有点慌乱地说。</p>
<p>‘Ah！’said the girl，‘but you see，she doesn't．’</p>
<p>“噢！”那女孩说，“可是，你明白，她不想见你。”</p>
<p>Mr Pumblechook dared not protest but he whispered angrily to me before he turned away，‘Boy！Behave well here and re-member those who brought you up by hand！’I thought he would come back and call through the gate，‘And sixteen？’but he did not．</p>
<p>潘波趣先生不敢坚持主张，但是，他在返回之前，恶狠狠地小声对我讲：“孩子！在这儿要规矩点，记住是谁亲手把你养大！”我想他会回来，通过门缝喊，“加16？”但是，他没有这样做。</p>
<p>The young lady took me through the untidy garden to the house．Although she called me ‘boy，’she was the same age as me，but she seemed much older than me．She was beautiful，and as proud as a queen．We went through many dark passages until we reached a door，where she left me，taking her candle with her．</p>
<p>那个年轻的小姐领着我穿过一座不整洁的花园来到这所房子。尽管她叫我“孩子，”她的年纪和我一样大，可是，看上去她比我还大点。她长得很漂亮，却像王后一样傲慢。我们穿过了几条漆黑的过道，才来到了一个房间门口，在这儿她带蜡烛离开了我。</p>
<p>I knocked at the door and was told to enter．I found myself in a large room，where the curtains were closed to allow no daylight in，and the candles were lit．In the centre of the room，sitting at a table，was the strangest lady I have ever seen，or shall ever see．She was wearing a wedding dress made of rich material．She had a bride's flowers in her hair，but her hair was white．There were suitcases full of dresses and Jewels around her，ready for a journey．She only had one white shoe on．‘Then I realized that over the years the white wedding dress had become yellow，and the flowers in her hair had died，and the bride inside the dress had grown old．Everything in the room was ancient and dying．The only brightness in the room was in her dark old eyes，that stared at me．</p>
<p>我敲了敲门，里面叫我进去。我发现自己在一个大房间里，这里的窗帘关得紧紧的，不让一缕日光透进来，但点着很多蜡烛。在屋子的中央，桌子旁坐着的是一位我从没有见过而且将不会再见到的，特别奇怪的夫人。她穿着一身由高级材料做的结婚礼服，头上戴着新娘花朵，但她已是满头银发了。她周围有些衣箱及珠宝，像似准备旅行。她只穿着一只白鞋，这时我才辨认出来，这么多年来白色的结婚礼服已经变黄了，头上戴的花朵已经干瘪了，新娘已经老了。屋里的一切都显得既古老又死气沉沉的。在屋子里仅有一光点是她那双黑色的老眼，瞪着我。</p>
<p>‘Who are you？’said the lady at the table．</p>
<p>“你是谁？”夫人在桌子旁问。</p>
<p>‘Pip，madam．Mr Pumblechook's boy．Come-to play．’</p>
<p>“匹普，夫人，潘波趣先生的孩子，来这儿玩的。”</p>
<p>‘Come close．Let me look at you．’As I stood in front of ＊her，I noticed that her watch and a clock in the room had both stopped at twenty minutes to nine．</p>
<p>“过来，靠近点儿，让我瞧瞧你。”当我站在她的面前时，我发现她的手表和屋子里的钟表都停止在8点40分。</p>
<p>‘You aren't afraid of a woman who has never seen the sun since you were born？’asked Miss Havisham．</p>
<p>“你害怕一个自你出世以来就没有见过阳光的女人吗？”郝薇香小姐问道。</p>
<p>I am sorry to say I told a huge lie by saying，‘No．’</p>
<p>“不怕。”很抱歉我说的不是实话。</p>
<p>‘Do you know what ths is？’she asked，putting her hand on her left side．</p>
<p>“你知道这是什么地方吗？”她的手放在左边胸口问道。</p>
<p>‘Yes，madam．’It made me think of my convict's travel-ling companion．‘Your heart，madam，’I added．</p>
<p>“知道，夫人。”这使我想起我的那个囚犯的同伙，“您的心脏，夫人，”我补充说。</p>
<p>‘My heart！Broken！’she cried almost proudly，with a strange smile．Then she said，‘I am tired．I want to see some-thing different．Play．’</p>
<p>“我的心脏！心碎啦！”她似乎很得意，讥笑着喊叫。然后，她说：“我累了，想看点新花样，玩。”</p>
<p>No order could be more difficult to obey in that house and that room．I was desperate enough to consider rushing round the table pretending to be Pumblechook's carriage，but I could not make myself do it，and just stood there helplessly．</p>
<p>在这座住宅和这间房屋里，没有比服从这命令更困难的事情，我挖空心思去琢磨，扮演潘波趣的马车冲着桌子转。可是，我自己不能做这个游戏，我正没有办法地站在那儿。</p>
<p>‘I'm very sorry，madam，’I said，‘my sister will be very angry with me if you complain，but I can't play just now．Everything is so strange，and new，and sad…’I stopped，afraid to say more．Miss Havisham looked down at her dress，and then at her face in the mirror on the table．</p>
<p>“很抱歉，夫人。”我说，“如果您向我姐姐告状，她会对我发怒的。但是，现在我不能玩。初来乍到的，这里的一切很陌生，很新鲜，也太凄凉了……”。我住口了，害怕说得太多。郝薇香小姐对着桌子上的镜子俯视她的衣服，然后，照了照自己的脸。</p>
<p>‘So strange to him，so well-known to me，’she whispered．‘So new to him，so old to me．And so sad to us both！Call Es-tella！’</p>
<p>“对他来说，如此陌生，对我来讲习以为常，”她自言自语道，“对他新鲜，对我陈旧，而对我们俩是太凄凉了！叫艾丝黛拉！”</p>
<p>When Estella finally came，with her candle，along the dark passage，Miss Havisham picked up a jewel from her table and put it in Estella's hair．‘Very pretty，my dear．It will be yours one day．Now let me see you play cards with this boy．’</p>
<p>最终，艾丝黛拉拿着蜡烛沿着漆黑的过道来了，郝薇香小姐从桌子上拿起一块宝石放在艾丝黛拉头上。“天哪，真漂亮，它将归你一天，让我看看你和这孩子玩牌。”</p>
<p>‘With this boy！But he's a common working boy！’</p>
<p>“和这个孩子！他是一个普通人家的孩子。”</p>
<p>I thought I heard Miss Havisham whisper，‘Well！You can break his heart！’She sat，like a dead body ready for the grave，watching us play cards in the candle-light．I almost wondered if she was afraid that daylight would turn her into dust．</p>
<p>我想我听到郝薇香小姐小声说：“喂！你能够打碎他的心！”她坐下，像一具要入墓的尸体，在烛光下看着我们玩牌。我几乎在想，如果她惧怕阳光，就把她送进尘埃里。</p>
<p>‘What coarse hands this boy has！And what thick boots！’cried Estella in disgust，before we had finished our first game．I was suddenly aware that what she said was true．</p>
<p>“这个孩子的双手多么粗糙！靴子多么的笨重！”我们打完第一局之前，艾丝黛拉厌恶地喊着。我忽然意识到，她是对的。</p>
<p>‘What do you think of her？’ Whispered Miss Havisham to me．</p>
<p>“你认为她怎么样？”郝薇香小姐耳语对我说。</p>
<p>‘I think she's very proud，’I whispered back．</p>
<p>“我认为她很傲慢，”我小声回敬了一句。</p>
<p>‘Anything else？’</p>
<p>“还有呢？”</p>
<p>‘I think she's very pretty．’</p>
<p>“我认为她很美。”</p>
<p>‘Anything else？’</p>
<p>“还有呢？”</p>
<p>‘I think she's very rude．And-and I'd like to go home．’</p>
<p>“我认为她不友好，还有——还有我想回家了。”</p>
<p>‘And never see her again，although she's so pretty？’</p>
<p>“不想再见到她了，尽管她很漂亮？”</p>
<p>‘I don't know．I'd-I'd like to go home now．’</p>
<p>“我不知道。现在，我想回家了。”</p>
<p>Miss Havisham smiled．‘You can go home．Come again in six days'time．Estella，give him some food．GO，Pip．’</p>
<p>郝薇香小姐笑着说：“你会很快回家的，6天以后再来。艾丝黛拉，给他些吃的。去吧，匹普。”</p>
<p>And so I found myself back in the overgrown garden in the bright daylight．Estella put some bread and meat down on the ground for me，like a dog．I was so offended by her behaviour towards me that tears came to my eyes．As soon as she saw this，She gave a delighted laugh，and pushed me out of the gate．I walked the four miles home to the forge，thinking about all I had seen．As I looked sadly at my hands and boots，I remembered that I was only a common working boy，and wished I could be different．</p>
<p>我发现自己在强烈的阳光下回到了那个长满藤蔓的花园里。艾丝黛拉给我拿了些面包和肉食，放在地上，像喂狗一样。我被她的行为触怒了，我的眼泪夺眶而出。一看到这一切，她得意地一笑，就把我推出了门外。我走了4英里的路回到铁匠铺，想起我所看到的一切。当我伤心地看着我的双手和靴子，我记住了，我只是一个普通家庭的孩子，我希望我能改变这一切。</p>
<p>My sister was curious to know all the details of my visit，and kept asking me question after question．Somehow I felt I could not，or did not want to，explain about Miss Havisham and her strange house．I knew my sister would not understand．And the worst of it was，that old fool Pumblechook arrived at tea-time，to ask more questions．Just looking at his fishy staring eyes and open mouth made me want to keep silent．</p>
<p>我姐姐好奇地想知道我出访的细节，一个问题接着一个问题地问我。不晓得什么缘故，我感到不可能，确实不能解释郝薇香小姐和她那奇怪的住宅，我知道我姐姐不会明白的。更糟糕的是老傻瓜潘波趣在喝茶的时间倒会来问更多的问题。看着他瞪着那鱼眼，张着嘴巴，这使我保持了沉默。</p>
<p>‘Leave this boy to me，madam，’he told Mrs Joe．‘I'll make him concentrate．Now，boy，what's forty-three and seventy-two？’</p>
<p>“把这孩子交给我，夫人，”他告诉乔夫人，“我会让他聚精会神。喂，孩子，43加72等于几？”</p>
<p>‘I don't know，’I said．I didn't care，either．</p>
<p>“不知道，”我说，我什么也不在乎。</p>
<p>‘Is it eighty-five，for example？’he joked．</p>
<p>“举个例子，是85吗？”他开玩笑说。</p>
<p>‘Yes！’I answered，although I knew it wasn't．My sister hit me hard on the head．</p>
<p>“是！”我回答，尽管我知道不是那个数。我姐姐狠狠地打了我的头。</p>
<p>‘Boy！’he continued．‘Describe Miss Havisham．’</p>
<p>“孩子！”他继续说，“描述一下郝薇香小姐。”</p>
<p>‘Very tall and dark，’I said，lying．</p>
<p>“又黑又高”，我撒谎地说。</p>
<p>‘Is she，uncle？’asked my sister eagerly．</p>
<p>“她是这样的吗，舅舅！”我姐姐关切地问道。</p>
<p>‘Oh yes，’answered Mr Pumblechook．So I knew immediately that he had never seen her．‘This is the way to get information from this boy，’he added quietly to Mrs Joe．</p>
<p>“噢，是的。”潘波趣先生回答。因此，我马上明白了，他从来没有见过她。“这是从这个孩子那里得到消息的方法”，他对乔夫人温和地补充说。</p>
<p>‘How well you make him obey you，uncle！’said Mrs Joe．</p>
<p>“怎样让他更好地顺从你，舅舅！”乔夫人说。</p>
<p>‘ Now，boy！What was she doing when you arrived？’</p>
<p>“喂，孩子！当你到达时她正在干什么？”</p>
<p>‘She was sitting in a black carriage，’I replied．</p>
<p>“她正坐在一个黑马车上，”我回答说。</p>
<p>Mr Pumblechook and Mrs Joe stared at each other．‘In a black carriage？’they repeated．</p>
<p>潘波趣先生和乔夫人互相瞅了瞅，“在黑马车上？”他们重复着说。</p>
<p>‘Yes，’I said，becoming more confident．‘And Miss Estella，her niece，I think，handed in gold plates with cake and wine through the windows．</p>
<p>“是的，”我变得更自信地说，“我想还有她的侄女艾丝黛拉小姐，通过窗户递进来盛有蛋糕和葡萄酒的金盘子。”</p>
<p>‘Was anybody else there？’asked Mr Pumblechook．</p>
<p>“那里还有其它人吗？”潘波趣先生问。</p>
<p>‘Four dogs，huge ones．They ate meat out of a silver basket．’</p>
<p>“有4只巨大的狗，它们从银笼子里探出头吃肉。”</p>
<p>‘Where was this carriage，boy？’</p>
<p>“这个马车在哪儿？孩子。”</p>
<p>‘In her room．But there weren't any horses．’</p>
<p>“在她的房间。但是，没有马。”</p>
<p>‘Can this be possible，uncle？’asked Mrs Joe．</p>
<p>“这可能吗？舅舅。”乔夫人问道。</p>
<p>‘She's a strange woman，madam．It's quite possible．What did you play at，boy？’</p>
<p>“她是个怪女人，夫人，那是很可能的。你玩什么啦，孩子？”</p>
<p>We played with flags，’I answered．What lies I was telling！‘Estella waved a blue one，and I had a red one，and Miss Havisham waved one with little gold stars on，out of the carriage window．’</p>
<p>“我们玩旗子，”我回答说，我撒的弥天大谎! “艾丝黛拉挥舞着蓝色的一面旗，我有红色的一面旗，郝薇香小姐在马车窗户外面挥动着一面旗，上面镶着小金星。”</p>
<p>Fortunately they asked no more questions，and were still discussing the wonderful things I had seen，when Joe came in from the forge．When I saw his blue eyes open wide in surprise，I felt very sorry I had lied，and that evening，as soon as I found Joe alone for a moment，I confessed to him that I had lied about my visit to Miss Havisham．</p>
<p>幸运的是他们再没有问题，仍然在讨论我所见到漂亮的东西，这时乔从锻工车间进来了。当我看到他吃惊地瞪着蓝色的大眼睛时，我对自己编造的谎言很内疚。我一发现乔独自呆一会儿时，就向他供认了关于我去拜访郝花香小姐所编造的谎话。</p>
<p>‘Is none of it true，Pip？’he asked，shocked．‘No black carriage ? But at least there were dogs， weren't there，Pip？No？Not even one dog？’</p>
<p>“那全不是真的？匹普！”他摇着头问，“没有黑的马车？但是，至少有狗吧，对吗？匹普，没有？一条狗也没有？”</p>
<p>‘No，Joe，I'm sorry．’</p>
<p>“没有，乔，很抱歉。”</p>
<p>‘Pip，old boy！’His kind face looked very unhappy．‘If you tell lies，where do you think you'll go when you die？’</p>
<p>“匹普，老伙计！”他慈祥的脸上看上去很不高兴，“如果你说谎，当你死了，想想你会去哪儿？”</p>
<p>‘I know，Joe，it's terrible．I don't know what happened．Oh I wish I didn't have such thick boots and such coarse hands！I'm so miserable，Joe．That beautiful young lady at Miss Havisham's said I was common．And I know I am！Somehow that made me tell lies．’</p>
<p>“我知道，乔，那是可怕的，我不知道发生什么事情，我希望我没有如此笨重的靴子和粗糙的双手！我是如此悲惨，乔。在郝薇香小姐家那个漂亮的年轻小姐说我是普通人家。我知道我是！莫名其妙地让我说谎。”</p>
<p>‘One thing to remember，Pip，’ said Joe，lighting his pipe slowly，‘is that lies are always wrong．You can't stop being common by telling lies．That's not the way to do it．And you're learning all the time，Pip！Look at that letter you wrote me last night！Even the King had to start learning at the beginning, didn't he？That reminds me，any flags at Miss Havisham's？No？That's a pity．Look here，Pip，this is a true friend speaking to you．Take my advice．No more lies，live well, and die happy.’</p>
<p>“有一件事情要记住，匹普，”乔点上烟斗说，“说谎总是错误的，你不能通过说谎来改变普通人家的身份，那样做是没有出路的。你所有的时间都在学习，匹普！看看你昨天晚上给我写的那封信！即使是国王开始也要从头做起，不是吗？这倒提醒我，郝薇香小姐家有旗子吗？没有？实在可怜。看这儿，匹普，这是一个真正的朋友对你说的话，记住我的劝告，不再说谎，才能活得自在，死得痛快。”</p>
<p>Encouraged by Joe's honest words I went to bed，but I couldn't stop myself thinking that Estella would consider Joe's boots too thick and his hands too coarse，and our whole family common．That was a day I shall never forget．</p>
<p>我被乔诚实的话语鼓励着去睡觉了。但是，自己静不下心，一直在想，艾丝黛拉认为乔的靴子太笨重，他的双手太粗糙和我们的普通世家。那是我难忘的一天。</p><a href='4.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
