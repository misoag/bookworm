<p><b>19 一次婚礼 </b></p>
<p>The excitement of all these events made me seriously ill for several weeks．Herbert was abroad， on business for Clarrikers，and there would have been nobody to look after me， if Joe bad not heard about my illness and come to London to nurse me．</p>
<p>一连串的打击使我严重病倒几周。赫伯特出国了，为克拉雷克斯做生意。如果不是乔听说我病了并来伦敦护理我，这里是没有人会照顾我的。</p>
<p>When I was getting better， he told me some of the local news．Miss Havisham had died，and left all her fortune to Estella，except for￡4000，which Matthew Pocket inherited．And Orlick had been arrested for breaking into Pumblechook's house and stealing his money．Dear old Joe seemed just the same， but as I got better，he began to remember I was a gentleman，and call me sir again，and when I got up one morning，I discovered he had gone．</p>
<p>当我渐渐好一点儿，他告诉我当地一些消息。郝薇香小姐已经死了，除了4000英镑由马修&middot;朴凯特继承，留下的所有财产归了艾丝黛拉。奥立克因为破门而入潘波趣的家偷了他的钱，已经被逮捕了，亲爱的老乔好像没什么变化。但是，当我更好一些，他开始想起我是一位绅士，又叫我先生。一天早晨，当我起了床时，发现他已经走了。</p>
<p>I decided to go back to the village，to thank him for all his help，and to carry out a plan I had been considering for some time．I wanted to ask Biddy to marry me，and I knew I would be happy with her．So I went by coach to the old town，as I had done so many times before， and walked to the forge． But as I came closer，I could not hear the sound of Joe's hammer，and I noticed fresh white curtains at the windows， and bright flowers everywhere．Suddenly I saw Biddy and Joe at the door，arm in arm．</p>
<p>我决定回铁匠铺，去感谢他的一切帮助，并携带着我已经考虑了一会儿的一个计划。我想请求毕蒂和我结婚，我知道和她会幸福的。因此，我乘马车去了老家，像这样的做法以前有很多次，我来到铁匠铺。但是，当我走近时，我听不到乔的锤子声音。我看到窗户上崭新的白色窗帘，到处是色彩鲜艳的花朵。在门口，突然我看到毕蒂和乔拥抱着。</p>
<p>‘Pip！’cried Biddy happily，running to kiss me．‘Pip，it's my wedding day，and I'm married to Joe！’</p>
<p>“匹普！”毕蒂高兴地叫起来，跑过来吻我，“匹普，今天是我的婚礼，我和乔结婚啦！”</p>
<p>I was still weak from my illness， and the shock was too much for me．They had to help me into the house and let me rest in a chair． They were both so pleased that I had come， by accident，to make their day perfect．I could only be glad that I had never spoken of my plan to Joe， when he was looking after me．</p>
<p>我仍然受疾病的折磨提不起精神，对我打击太大了。他们不得不帮助我进了屋，让我在椅子上休息。他们俩对我的偶然到来如此高兴，使他们的婚礼更完美。我唯一高兴的是，当他照顾我时，从来没有对他讲过我的计划。</p>
<p>‘Dear Biddy，’I said，‘you have the best husband in the whole world．’</p>
<p>“亲爱的毕蒂，”我说，“你有世界最好的丈夫。”</p>
<p>‘I couldn't love him more than I do，’ she replied．</p>
<p>“我特别爱他。”她回答说。</p>
<p>‘And dear Joe， you have the best wife in the world， and she will make you as happy as even you deserve to be， dear good Joe！’Joe put his arm over his eyes．‘And Joe and Biddy， I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for all you've done for me． Tell me you forgive me for not being grateful，and not being good． And think better of me in the future！’</p>
<p>“亲爱的乔，你有世界上最好的妻子，她会使你和你应得的一样幸福，亲爱的大好人乔！”乔用手臂捂着双眼，“乔和毕蒂，我从内心感谢你们为我所做的一切。告诉我，你们原谅我没有感恩、没有做好。想想我将来会好起来的！”</p>
<p>‘Oh dear old Pip，’said Joe，‘God knows we forgive you，if there is anything to forgive！’</p>
<p>“噢，亲爱的老匹普，”乔说，“如果有什么可原谅的，上帝知道，我们原谅你！”</p>
<p>So I left the forge，and started a new life， working as a clerk for Clarrikers，Herbert's company． I was sent to the new office in India to take charge，while Herbert came back to England to marry his Clara．</p>
<p>因此，我离开铁匠铺，开始一种新生活，做了一名职员为克拉雷克斯，赫伯特的公司工作。当赫伯特回到英格兰和他的克莱拉结婚时，我被指派到印度的新事务所从事收费工作。</p>
<p>Herbert and his wife invited me to live with them， and we all stayed out in India for many years．In the end I too became a partner in the company．We worked hard and honestly， and made good profits．</p>
<p>赫伯特和他的妻子邀请我和他们住在一起，我们在印度住了许多年。最终，我在该公司也成了一个股东。我们努力诚实地工作，并取得了丰厚的利润。</p>
<p>It was not until eleven years later that I returned to England and saw Biddy and Joe again，although I had been writing regularly to them．One evening in December I gently pushed open the old kitchen door， and there，sitting by the fire next to Joe，in my old place，was-Pip！Joe and Biddy's son had my name and looked just like me．They also had a little daughter，and were the happiest of parents．</p>
<p>最终，11年后，我回到了英格兰，再一次看看毕蒂和乔。虽然，我经常给他们写信。在12月份的一个晚上，我轻轻地推开那个旧厨房门。在这儿，这是我的老地方，在火炉旁边紧挨着乔坐着的是——匹普！乔和毕蒂的儿子取了我的名字，看上去很像我。他们还有一个小女儿，是最幸福的父母。</p>
<p>‘Dear Pip，’said Biddy quietly to me after supper，‘have you quite forgotten her？ Tell me， as an old friend．’</p>
<p>“亲爱的匹普，”晚饭后，毕蒂心平气和地对我说，“你差不多忘记她了吧？作为一个老朋友，告诉我。”</p>
<p>‘My dear Biddy，I can never forget her． But that was all a dream， which has passed！’</p>
<p>“我亲爱的毕蒂，我从来不能忘记她，不过，那都是梦想，一切成为过去！”</p>
<p>But I was secretly planning to revisit Miss Havisham's old house， alone， as a way of remembering Estella． I had heard that her husband had been very cruel to her．They had separated，and then he had died two years ago．Perhaps she had remarried by now．</p>
<p>但是，我正秘密地计划去单独重访郝薇香小姐的故居，作为想起艾丝黛拉的方法。我听说过，她的丈夫对她十分粗野，他们已经离婚。两年前，他已经死了。或许目前她已经再婚了。</p>
<p>The old house had been knocked down， and there was nothing left but piles of stones in the garden． In the moonlight I walked sadly around，until suddenly I saw a woman's figure in the shadows．I went closer and then——</p>
<p>那座旧住宅已经被拆掉，没有什么东西留下，而在花园里有一堆石头。在日光下，我伤心地在周围转转，直到我突然朦朦胧胧看见一个女人的身影。我走近一些，这时——</p>
<p>‘Estella！’I cried．</p>
<p>“艾丝黛拉！”我叫喊起来。</p>
<p>‘You recognize me？I have changed a lot，’she answered．</p>
<p>“你认得出我？我变了许多，”她回答。</p>
<p>She was older，but still beautiful．I had never before seen such a soft light in those once proud eyes，or felt such a friend-ly touch of her once cold hand．</p>
<p>她是老了一些，但是仍然很漂亮。我以前从来没有在这双曾经傲慢的眼睛上见过这样的温柔明亮，摸到她那曾经冷冰冰的手感觉这样的亲切。</p>
<p>‘It's strange， Estella！ Afer so many years，we meet by chance，here，where we first met！’</p>
<p>“真奇怪，艾丝黛拉！这么多年后，我们在这里也是第一次见面的地方偶然相见！”</p>
<p>‘Yes，it's strange．I haven't been here for years，although the land belongs to me．But tell me，you still live abroad？’</p>
<p>“是的，真奇怪，虽然这块房基地是属于我的，但是，我多年不在这里了。告诉我，你还住在国外吗？”</p>
<p>‘Yes，I still do．I'm doing well in India．’</p>
<p>“是的，我还在国外，我在印度干得很好。”</p>
<p>‘I've often thought of you．Since-my husband-died，I have given you a place in my heart．’</p>
<p>“我常想起你，自从——我的丈夫——死后，我一直给你在心中留着位置。”</p>
<p>‘You have always held your place in my heart，I answered．</p>
<p>“你总是在我心中占有位置，”我回答。</p>
<p>There was silence for a few moments．</p>
<p>沉默了一会儿。</p>
<p>‘I didn't think I would say goodbye to you here，’she said．</p>
<p>“我不想在这儿向你告别。”她说。</p>
<p>‘It's painful saying goodbye，Estella．’</p>
<p>“告别，那是痛苦的，艾丝黛拉。”</p>
<p>‘But last time you said，“God bless you， God forgive you！”You could say that to me now， now that I understand how much you loved me， now that I have suffered， now that I am a better person．Tell me we are friends．’She spoke more eagerly than I had ever heard her speak before．</p>
<p>“但是，最后一次你说，‘上帝保佑你，上帝原谅你！’你现在能对我那样说吗。现在，我才明白你是多么的爱我，现在，我很痛苦，现在，我是个比较好的人。告诉我，我们是朋友。”她渴望说的超过以前我听到过她说的话。</p>
<p>‘We are friends，’ I said，taking her hand．</p>
<p>“我们是朋友，”我拉着她的手说。</p>
<p>‘And will continue being friends，even when we are apart，’said Estella．</p>
<p>“即使我们分开，也会继续是朋友，”艾丝黛拉说。</p>
<p>We walked，hand in hand， out of the old garden．As the morning mist had risen long ago when I first left the forge，so the evening mist was rising now，and in the clear moonlight I saw no shadow of another separation from her．</p>
<p>我们手拉手走出那个旧花园。当晨雾老早升起来的时候，我第一次离开了铁匠铺。那么，现在夜雾正在升起，在这清朗的月光下，我却看不到另外一个影子从她那里分离出来。</p></body></html>
