<p><b>8 拜访文米克先生和贾格斯先生 </b></p>
<p>Herbert introduced me to his father， who lived the other side of London， in Hammersmith． In the next few months I studied hard with Mr Pocket， who was always a most kind and helpful teacher．I divided my time between Herbert's and his father's home． If I needed money，I collected it from Wemmick at Mr Jaggers’ office， and there seemed to be plenty of money available．</p>
<p>赫伯特把我介绍给他父亲，他的父亲住在伦敦的另一边，在汉麦尔斯密斯。后来的几个月，我要跟朴凯特先生努力地学习，朴凯特先生永远是一位很慈祥、很乐于助人的老师。不过，我的时间是在赫伯特和他父亲两个家中度过。如果需要钱，我就从贾格斯先生事务所文米克那里取，那儿的钱好像取之不尽，用之不竭。</p>
<p>There were two other gentlemen studying at Mr Pocket's．They were quite different from each other． Bentley Drummle came from a rich family living in the country． He was lazy，proud， mean and stupid．I much preferred Startop， who was a pleasant， sensitive young man．He and I used to row our boats up and down the river together． But Herbert was my greatest friend， and we used to spend most of our time with each other．</p>
<p>在朴凯特先生家里学习的，还有另外两名绅士，他们之间有很大的区别。本特利&middot;朱穆尔来自乡下一个富有的家庭，他懒惰傲慢，卑鄙和愚蠢。我更喜欢史达多蒲，他是一个快活的、反应灵敏的年轻人。我和他经常一起下河划小船。但是，赫伯特是我最知心的朋友，我们大部分的时间经常是我俩在一起度过。</p>
<p>One day when I was collecting my money from Wemmick，he invited me to his house at Walworth， a village outside Lon－don．</p>
<p>一天，当我从文米克那里收到钱时，他邀请我去他的家，是在伦敦郊区的一个村庄——沃尔鄂斯。</p>
<p>‘You don't mind walking there， Mr Pip？’he asked．‘I like to get some exercise if I can．For dinner we're having a roast chicken． I think it'll be a good one because I got it from one of our clients． I always accept any little presents from clients， especially if it's cash， or anything that can easily be changed into cash． You see these rings I'm wearing？ Given by clients， just before they died．All hanged， they were．By the way，I hope you won't mind meeting my aged parent？’</p>
<p>“走着去你不介意吧？匹普。”他问道，“如果我可能的话，想锻炼锻炼。晚餐我们有一只烤鸡，我想它的味道很好。因为，是从我们其中一位诉讼委托人那里得到的。我总是从诉讼委托人那里收受点礼品，尤其是现金，或者是能够容易兑换成现金的任何东西。你看到我带的这些项链了吗？正是顾客死以前给的，他们都被处以绞刑。顺便说一句，希望你见到我年迈的父亲不会介意？”</p>
<p>‘No，of course not，’I said quickly．</p>
<p>“不会，当然不会的，”我很快地回答。</p>
<p>‘You haven't had dinner with Mr Jaggers yet？’ Wemmick continued．‘He's inviting you， and the other three young gentlemen， tomorrow． There'll be good food and drink at his house． But I'll tell you something， Mr Pip．When you're there， look at his housekeeper．’</p>
<p>“你还没有和贾格斯先生吃过晚饭吧？”文米克接着说，“他正邀请你明天和另外三位年轻绅士，在他家，会有丰盛的酒席。不过，我将告诉你一些事情，匹普先生，当你在那里的时候，看看他的女管家。”</p>
<p>‘Why？’ I asked．‘Is there something strange about her？’</p>
<p>“为什么？”我问，“她有奇怪的地方吗？”</p>
<p>‘She's like a wild animal．But Mr Jaggers has trained her！Oh yes！He's stronger，and cleverer， and more complicated than anyone else in London．And you know，another strange thing about him， he never locks his doors or windows at night．’</p>
<p>“她像一只野兽。但是，贾格斯先生已经训练了她！噢，是的！在伦敦他比其他任何人强壮、聪明、更精细。你知道，另一件奇怪的事情，晚上，他从不锁门窗。”</p>
<p>‘Isn't he ever robbed？’I asked in surprise．</p>
<p>“他从来没被盗过？”我惊奇地问。</p>
<p>‘All the thieves in London know where he lives，but none of them would dare to rob him． They are all afraid of him， you see．They know he wouldn't rest until he had seen them hanged． He's a great man， Mr Pip．’</p>
<p>“伦敦的小偷都知道他住的地方，可是，他们没有一个敢去偷他的东西，都害怕他，你明白。他们知道，直到他看着他们被绞死，才会休息。他是一个了不起的人物，匹普先生。”</p>
<p>Wemmick's house at Walworth was a tiny wooden house in the middle of a garden． On top of the roof was a small gun．</p>
<p>在沃尔鄂斯，文米克的房子是一座小木房，周围是花园，屋顶上有一把小猎枪。</p>
<p>‘We fire the gun at nine o’clock every evening，’said Wemmick proudly．‘And behind the house－I call it the Castle－I keep animals， and grow my own vegetables．So，in case of enemy attack， we can always eat our own food．What do you think of it？’</p>
<p>“我们每天晚上9点开枪，”文米克自豪地说，“在房子后面——我叫它城堡——我养家畜和自己种疏菜。因此，万一敌人袭击，我们总能吃上自己的食物，你认为如何？”</p>
<p>I congratulated him on his home． He was clearly delighted to show a visitor all his ideas and improvements．</p>
<p>在他家里，我向他祝贺。很显然，他乐意向来访者表白他的主意和进步。</p>
<p>‘I do everything myself，you know，’ he said．‘It helps me forget the office for a while． Would you mind being introduced to the Aged now？ He would like it very much．’</p>
<p>“每件事情都是我自己做，你知道，”他说，“它能帮助我暂时忘掉那个事务所。现在向老人介绍你不反对吧？他会十分喜欢的。”</p>
<p>So we entered the Castle， where we found a cheerful old man sitting by the fire．</p>
<p>因此，我们进了这座城堡，发现一位快乐的老人正坐着烤火。</p>
<p>‘well，aged parent，’ said Wemmick，‘how are you？’</p>
<p>“喂，老父亲，”文米克说，“你好吗？”</p>
<p>‘Very well， John，’ replied the old man，nodding happily．</p>
<p>“很好，约翰，”老人高兴地点点头说。</p>
<p>‘Here's Mr Pip，aged parent． Nod your head at him， Mr Pip，he's completely deaf，but he likes to see people nod at him．’</p>
<p>“这是匹普先生，老父亲。向他点点你的头，匹普，他完全耳聋。但是，他喜欢看到人们向他点头。”</p>
<p>‘This is a fine house of my son's， sir，’ cried the old man，nodding back at me．‘It should be kept by the nation for the public to visit after my son's death．’</p>
<p>“这是我儿子雅致的房子，先生。”老人喊着，向我回敬着点头，“我儿子死后，这座房子会被国家保存起来，供人们参观。”</p>
<p>‘You're proud of it，aren't you，Aged？’said Wemmick，his face losing all its usual hardness as he looked at the old man．</p>
<p>“你为这座房子感到自豪，对吗？老父亲。”文米克说，当他看着老人时，以往脸上冷冰冰的表情悄然失散。</p>
<p>‘I hope Mr Jaggers admires your home， Mr Wemmick？’ I asked．</p>
<p>“我希望贾格斯先生羡慕你的家，文米克先生？”我说。</p>
<p>‘He's never been here． Never met the Aged．Never been invited． No， the office is one thing， and private life is another． At the office I never speak of the Castle， and at the Castle I don't think about the office．’</p>
<p>“他从不来这儿，从不见这位老人，从不拜访。不，事务所是一码事，而个人的生活是另一码事。在事务所，我从来不提这座城堡的事，而在这座城堡里，我不考虑事务所的事。”</p>
<p>The Aged was obviously looking forward to the evening ceremony of firing the gun． At nine o’clock exactly Wemmick fired it．As the tiny house shook， the Aged jumped up and down in his armchair， crying excitedly，‘I heard it！That's the gun！’</p>
<p>显而易见，这位老人正盼望着晚上的开枪仪式。在9点钟，文米克确实开枪。当这座小房子振动时，这位老人在椅子上跳上跳下，兴高采烈地叫喊着，“我听到了！那是枪声！”</p>
<p>Supper was excellent， and I spent the night in the smallest bedroom I had ever seen． Next morning， as Wemmick and I walked back to London， I noticed his face becoming dryer and harder， and his mouth becoming more like a post-box again．When we arrived at the office，nobody could have guessed that he had a home， or an aged parent， or any interests at all out－side his work．</p>
<p>晚餐极丰盛，我在从未见过的最小的就寝房间里消磨了这一夜。第二天早晨，当我和文米克走回伦敦时，我发现他的脸又干又硬，他的嘴又变得像一个邮箱。当我们到达事务所，没有人能猜到他有一个家，或一位老父亲，或他工作之外的许多乐趣。</p>
<p>Wemmick was right in saying that Mr Jaggers would invite me to dinner． Startop， Drummle， Herbert and I were asked to go to the office at six o’clock the next evening．There we found Jaggers washing his hands and face carefully with per－fumed soap． He did this every evening before going home． He seemed to be washing away his clients and his work， like dirt．We all walked to his house together．</p>
<p>文米克说贾格斯先生将邀我吃晚饭是对的。第二天晚上6点钟，史达多蒲、朱穆尔、赫伯特和我被叫到事务所。在这儿，我们发现贾格斯先生用香皂仔细地洗手洗脸。他每天晚上回家之前都这么做。他像洗脏物一样，似乎要洗掉他的顾客和工作。我们大家一起走向他家。</p>
<p>The housekeeper brought in the first dish． She was about forty，with a strange wild expression on her pale face． She seemed almost afraid of her master， and looked anxiously at him whenever she entered the room．</p>
<p>女管家首先上菜盘。她大概40多岁，在她苍白的脸上有一种奇怪的野蛮表情。她好像害怕她的主人，不管什么时候进到这间屋子，她都很忧虑地看着他。</p>
<p>The food was indeed very good， and the conversation was cheerful． But somehow Mr Jaggers made us all show the worst side of our characters， and encouraged Drummle， who we all disliked，to annoy us． When Drummle stupidly said that he was stronger than any of us， we all protested， foolishly showing each other our muscles to prove how strong we were．Suddenly Mr Jaggers clapped his large hand on the housekeeper's，as she was removing a dish． We stopped talking immediately．</p>
<p>吃的确实是美味佳肴，谈话也是欢快的。但是，贾格斯先生莫名其妙地让我们大家都表露一下自己性格最坏的一面，鼓动着我们都不喜欢惹我们生气的朱穆尔说。当朱穆尔大言不惭地说他比我们都强壮时，我们都反对，愚蠢地相互显示一下我们的肌肉来证明我们是多么强壮。突然，贾格斯先生向正在收拾盘子的女管家拍拍他那双大手。我们立即停止谈话。</p>
<p>‘Gentlemen，’ he said，‘look at my housekeeper here．She is stronger than any of you．Molly， show them your wrists．’</p>
<p>“绅士们，”他说，“看看我这儿的女管家，她比你们任何一名都强壮。莫莉，给他们看看你的手腕。”</p>
<p>‘No， please， master，’ she begged， trying to pull away， but he held her hand firmly．</p>
<p>“别了，求求您啦，主人，”她乞求着说，企图拽走。但是，他紧紧地握着她的手。</p>
<p>‘Show them，Molly，’ he said，and she held her wrists out to us．‘I've never seen stronger hands than these，’he said．There was silence for a few minutes．‘All right， Molly， you can go，’he said， and she hurried out．</p>
<p>“给他们看看，莫莉，”他说，她拿出自己的腕给我们看，“我从来没有见过比这双手更强壮的，”他说。片刻，鸦鹊无声。“很好，莫莉，你可以走了，”他说。她急忙出去了。</p>
<p>During the rest of the dinner， Mr Jaggers continued to enjoy watching us quarrelling with Drummle．He gave the impression，surprisingly， of liking Drummle very much．But I was glad when the dinner was over， and Herbert and I could walk quietly back to our rooms together．</p>
<p>在晚饭休息期间，贾格斯先生饶有兴趣地看着我们和朱穆尔争吵。他给人们一个奇怪的印象，正合朱穆尔的意。不过，当晚餐结束时，我很高兴，我和赫伯特能一起赶快回我们的房间了。</p><a href='9.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
