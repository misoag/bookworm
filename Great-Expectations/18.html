<p><b>18 马格韦契的故事结束 </b></p>
<p>It was a cold，bright morning when we set out cheerfully down the river．I steered the boat，Herbert and Startop rowed．At Clara's house Magwitch was waiting for us，wrapped in a dark cloak．</p>
<p>那是一个冷飕飕的、阳光明媚的早晨。我们高兴地动身下了河，赫伯特和史达多蒲划船，我掌舵，在克莱拉家里，马格韦契卷着一件黑斗蓬正在等候我们。</p>
<p>‘Dear boy！’he said， putting his hand on my shoulder as he sat down heavily in the boat．‘Thank you！’</p>
<p>“亲爱的孩子！”他说，他重重地在船上坐下，把手搭在我的肩上说，“谢谢你”。</p>
<p>We rowed eastwards down the river all day， looking round all the time to check that no one was following us Magwitch seemed quite happy， smoking his pipe and watching the water．</p>
<p>我们全天向河东方向划去，随时向四周张望，警惕有没有人跟踪我们。马格韦契吸着烟斗，望着水面，看上去很高兴。</p>
<p>You don't know what a pleasure it is to me， Pip，’he said once，‘to be with my dear boy，in the open air．’</p>
<p>“你不知道，我是多么高兴，匹普”，他说了一遍，“自由自在地和我亲爱的孩子在一起。”</p>
<p>‘You'll be completely safe， and free， tomorrow，’ I said．</p>
<p>“你明天就会完全脱离危险，自由自在，”我说。</p>
<p>‘I hope so，dear boy．But looking into the frture，well，that's like looking for the bottom of the river， isn't it？ Can't be done．’He remained silent after that．</p>
<p>“我希望如此，亲爱的孩子。但是，展望未来，喂，那就像寻找河底一样，对吗？不是轻易而举的。”之后，他保持沉默。</p>
<p>We decided to spend the night at a little riverside pub．It seemed safe because there were no other guests， but the pub owner asked us a question which worried us．</p>
<p>我们决定在一个河边小客栈过夜，这儿似乎安全，因为没有其他客人。但是，客栈老板向我们问的一个问题却让我们担忧。</p>
<p>‘Did you see that boat go past， gentlemen？ Rowed by four men， with two others on board．It's been up and down the river several times．Could be a Customs boat．’</p>
<p>“你们看见划过去的那只船，先生们？4个人划船，船上还有另外两个人，这个船划来划去好几次了，可能是海关的船。”</p>
<p>When he left us alone， we discussed this information in whispers．In the end we decided to go to bed， and then set out the next morning just in time to catch the ship to Hamburg．I woke early，and when I looked out of the window，I saw two men examining our boat，but I decided not to wake Herbert or Startop，who needed their rest after rowing all the previous day．</p>
<p>当他离开我们时，我们小声地讨论了这个信息。最后，我们决定去睡觉，然后第二天早晨出发，正点赶上去汉堡的船只。我一大早就醒了，当我从窗外望去时，看到两个人检查我们的船。但是，我决定不去叫醒赫伯特和史达多蒲，他们划了一整天船需要休息。</p>
<p>Late in the morning we rowed into the centre of the river．We could see the ship to Hamburg coming closer． Magwitch and I picked up our bags，and said goodbye to Herbert and Startop，so that we would be ready to stop the ship and get on board．Suddenly a boat rowed by four men appeared from nowhere and came out very fast into the centre of the river，close to us． A fifth man was steering， and a sixth， his face hidden in his cloak， whispered instructions to the steerer．They all stared at us．</p>
<p>早晨晚些时候，我们划进河中心。我们能够看到去汉堡的船正在接近我们，我和马格韦契拿起我们的包裹，向赫伯特和史达多蒲告别，以便我们做好准备，那只船一停我们就上去。突然，一只4人划的船不知从什么地方来的，飞快地到了河中心，向我们逼近。第4个人掌舵，第6个人用斗蓬捂着他的脸，向那个舵手耳语几句，他们都盯着我们。</p>
<p>‘You have a convict there who's returned from Australia，’shouted the steerer．‘That's the man，in the cloak．His name is Abel Magwitch．I'm a Customs officer and I arrest him！’</p>
<p>“你们那里有一个从澳大利亚来的罪犯，”那个舵手叫喊着，“就是穿斗蓬的那个人，他叫阿伯尔&middot;马格韦契，我是海关警官，我要逮捕他！”</p>
<p>Suddenly their boat was touching ours．The Hamburg ship was almost on top of us， and the ship's captain shouted the or-der to stop engines， but it was too late． At the same moment the Customs officer put his hand on Magwitch's shoulder，and Magwitch pulled the cloak off the other man in the boat．It was Compeyson！And as I watched，he fell backwards into the water，his face full of terror．The huge ship hit our tiny boat with a great crash，Somehow the Customs officers managed to get me on board their boat，with Herbert and Startop，but our boat sank，and the two convicts had disappeared．</p>
<p>突然，他们的船撞上我们的船，那艘汉堡的船离我们近在咫尺，该船船长呼喊命令关掉发动机，可是已经太晚了。同时，那个海关警官揪住马格韦契的肩膀，马格韦契扯掉在那只船上另一个人的斗蓬，是康培生。当我观察的时候，他仰面朝天掉进水时，他看上去很恐惧。巨轮撞击我们的小船，伴随着巨大的轰隆声。海关警官们设法把我和赫伯特、史达多蒲救到他们的船上。可是，我们的船下沉了，那两个逃犯已不知去向。</p>
<p>Soon，however，we discovered Magwitch in the water，badly injured，and pulled him into the boat． He told me that he had fallen into the water with Compeyson，and then been hit by the ship．I believed what he said．At the time there was no sign of Compeyson，whose dead body was found several days later．</p>
<p>但是，不久我们在水面上发现了马格韦契，伤得很重，把他拖到船上。他告诉我，他和康培生已经掉进水里，往上浮的时候被船撞伤，我相信他说的。当时，没有康培生的踪影，几天后，他的尸体才被发现。</p>
<p>Magwitch was taken to prison to wait for his trial．I arranged for Jaggers to be his lawyer，but Jaggers warned me there was almost no hope of saving his life．Magwitch's thick wallet was handed over to the police，and Wemmick was quite annoyed with me about it．</p>
<p>马格韦契被投入监狱听候审判，我安排贾格斯出任他的律师。但是，贾格斯提醒我救他的命几乎是没有希望。马格韦契厚厚的钱夹子被送交警察局，有关这件事，文米克对我很恼火。</p>
<p>‘Really， Mr Pip， to lose so much cash！’ he said．‘You see，Compeyson was so determined to get his revenge that you couldn't have saved Magwitch． But you certainly could have saved the cash．That's the difference． But could I ask you something， Mr Pip？ Would you come for a walk with me on Monday morning？’</p>
<p>“真的，匹普先生，失去这么多钱！”他说，“你明白，康培生如此决定报仇致使你不能救马格韦契。可是，你确实能救那份钱，那是有区别的。但是，我能要求你多少？匹普先生？星期一早晨你能来和我散步吗？”</p>
<p>It seemed a strange request， and although I did not really feel like accepting， he politely insisted．</p>
<p>这好像是一个奇怪的要求，虽然我不是真正乐意接受，他还是有礼貌地坚持。</p>
<p>I arrived at the Castle early on Monday morning， and after a glass of rum and milk， we set out on the road．</p>
<p>星期一一大早，我到了那座城堡，喝了一杯朗姆酒和牛奶以后，我们动身上了路。</p>
<p>‘Well，well！’ said Wemmick suddenly．‘Here's a church！Let's go in！’And when we were inside，there was another surprise．</p>
<p>“喂，喂！”文米克突然说，“那儿是教堂！我们进去！”当我们在里边时，又有一个意外。</p>
<p>‘Well，well！’ he said again．‘Look what I've found in my pockets！Let's put them on！’As he had‘found’two pairs of white gloves，and his post-box mouth was as wide as it could possibly be，I began to suspect something．And when I saw the Aged come in with a lady，I knew I was right．</p>
<p>“喂，喂，”他又说“瞧，在我口袋里发现了！把它们戴上！”当他“发现”两副白手套时，他的邮箱嘴拼命地张大。我开始猜想什么，当我看见那位老人和一位小姐进来时，我知道我猜对了。</p>
<p>‘Well，well！’said Wemmick，still pretending to be sur-prised，‘here's the Aged，and Miss Skiffins！ Let's have a wedding！’</p>
<p>“喂，喂！”文米克说，仍然假装很吃惊，“这是那位老长者和斯基芬小姐！让我们举行一个婚礼！”</p>
<p>And so wemmick was married to Miss Skiffins， and we all celebrated afterwards at a little pub near the church．</p>
<p>这样，文米克和斯基芬小姐结了婚。其后，我们大家在教堂附近的一座小饭馆祝贺他们。</p>
<p>I was delighted for Wemmick，but I could not stop worrying about Magwitch．He had been so badly injured that he was moved to the prison hospital，where I visited him every day．I read to him， and talked to him， and did everything I could to make him comfortable． But day by day I watched him becom-ing weaker，although he never complained．To the prison guards he was a dangerous criminal， but to me he was an un-fortunate man，who had at least some goodness in him．I could not leave him now．</p>
<p>我为文米克高兴，但是，我抑制不住为马格韦契的担忧。他伤得如此之重，以致被转住监狱医院，在这里，我每天看看他。我给他读书，给他讲话，我做的每一件事情都能让他愉快起来。但是，我看到他的体质每况愈下，尽管他从来不说。对于监狱警卫来说，他是一个危险的罪犯。但是对我来讲，他是一个不幸的人，只有最后一点儿快乐属于他，我不能现在抛弃他。</p>
<p>At his trial Jaggers was proved right． The judge decided that Magwitch，a convict sent away for life who had returned，must be hanged．I could not accept this terrible punishment，and wrote to all the important people I could think of， asking for mercy for Magwitch．But all of them refused to help．</p>
<p>在他的判决中，证明贾格斯判断是对的。法官决定，马格韦契，一个被终身发配的罪犯逃回来、必须被绞死。我不能接受这个可怕的惩罚，写信给我能够想起来的所有大人物，请求给予马格韦契宽大处理。但是，他们都拒绝帮助。</p>
<p>I noticed，on my daily visits to him， that he was getting much worse．He lay in bed，looking calmly at the white ceiling．Sometimes he could not speak，and just pressed my hand．One evening as I entered his room， he smiled weakly at me．</p>
<p>我每天去看他，发现他的状况越来越糟。他躺在床上，安静地瞅着天花板。有时，他说不了话，仅仅握着我的手。一天晚上，当我进到他的房间时，他对我淡淡地一笑。</p>
<p>‘Dear boy，’he said，‘you're never late．’</p>
<p>“亲爱的孩子！”他说，“你从来不晚。”</p>
<p>‘I don't want to lose a moment of the time I'm allowed to visit you，’I said．</p>
<p>“我不想失去允许我看望你的每一分钟。”我说。</p>
<p>‘Thank you， dear boy．God bless you！You've never de serted me，dear boy！’ He had spoken his last words．</p>
<p>“谢谢你，亲爱的孩子，上帝保佑你！你从来没有抛弃我，亲爱的孩子！”他说了最后一句话。</p>
<p>I touched his chest，remembering that I had wanted to desert him once．He put both his hands on mine．</p>
<p>我摸着他的胸部，想起我曾经要抛弃他。他的双手放在我的手上。</p>
<p>‘Dear Magwitch，listen to me．You had a child once， who you loved and lost．’He pressed my hand gently．‘She's alive．She's a lady and very beautiful．And I love her！’</p>
<p>“亲爱的马格韦契，听我说，你曾经有一个你痛爱和失去的孩子，”他轻轻地握着我的手，“她还活着，她是一位小姐并且十分漂亮，我爱她！”</p>
<p>He was too weak to speak any more， but he just managed to lift my hand to his lips．Then he looked peacefully up at the white ceiling again．Slowly his eyes closed and his head dropped quietly on to his chest．</p>
<p>他太虚弱以致不能说话，但是，他使出最后一点微弱之力，把我的手拉到他的唇边，他的眼睛慢慢地闭上了，他的头静静地垂在他的胸前。</p><a href='19.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
