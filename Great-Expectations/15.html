<p><b>15 马格韦斯隐藏起来 </b></p>
<p>I spent a restless night at a hotel，worrying about the reasons for Wemmick's warning．Early in the morning I went to see him at the Castle．He told me he had heard I was being watched，and that someone was looking for Magwitch．He also knew that Compeyson was alive and in London．While I was absent，Wemmick had warned Herbert to move our guest to a safer place．Clara，the girl Herbert was in love with，lived with her old father in a house on the river，quite near the open sea，and Herbert had arranged to rent rooms for Magwitch in this house．It was further away from the centre of London and our home，and we could easily take Magwitch abroad by boat from there．</p>
<p>我在一家旅店度过了一个不眠之夜，为文米克警告的原因担忧。一大早我去那个城堡见他，他告诉我，他听说有人正监视我，有人正在寻找马格韦契，他还知道康培生还活着，在伦敦。当我不在的时候，文米克已经提醒赫伯特把我们的客人转移到安全的地方。克莱拉，这个和赫伯特相爱的姑娘，和她父亲住在靠近河边的一座房子里，离宽阔的大海很近。赫伯特已经安排了在这座房子里为马格韦契租间房子，这座房子离伦敦市中心和我们的家很远。从这里，我们能很容易地通过船把马格韦契送往国外。</p>
<p>‘Our friend is there now，’said Wemmick，‘and you can visit him tonight，but don't go back there after that．And re－member，Mr Pip，’he added firmly，‘remember to get his cash．You don't know what may happen to him．Don't let anything happen to his cash．’</p>
<p>“现在，我们的朋友在这里，”文米克说，“你今晚就能拜访他。不过，在这之后不要回那儿。记住，匹普先生，”他紧接着说，“记住得到他的钱，你不知道对他来说会发生什么，不要让他的钱发生任何事情。”</p>
<p>I could not explain to Wemmick how I felt about Magwich's money，so I said nothing．</p>
<p>我高不清文米克怎么会惦记马格韦契的钱。因此，我什么也没说。</p>
<p>That evening I visited the house，and met Clara，a lovely girl，obviously in love with Herbert．How lucky she and Herbert were！I thought of Estella，and felt very sad．</p>
<p>那天晚上，我去了这座房子，遇上了克莱拉，一个可爱的姑娘，显而易见，和赫伯特相爱。她和赫伯特是多么的幸运！我想到艾丝黛拉，感到十分伤心。</p>
<p>Magwitch seemed quieter and more likeable than the last time I had seen him．He accepted all our arrangements for him gratefully．I was almost sorry to say goodbye to him．</p>
<p>马格韦契看起来比较镇静，比我上一次见到的他更温和了，可喜的是他全部接受了我们为他的安排，我几乎很难过对他说再见。</p>
<p>I decided to keep a rowing boat near our rooms，so that Her－bert or I could row up and down the river，as far as Clara's house．If Magwitch saw us on the river，he could draw his bedroom curtain to show everything was all right．</p>
<p>我决定在我们住处的附近雇用一只小划船，以便我或者赫伯特能在河道里划来划去，能划到克莱拉的家那么远。如果马格韦契在河上看到我们，拉开他卧室的窗帘就能很好地展示一切。</p>
<p>For the next few weeks，life went on as normal．Herbert went to work and visited Clara in the evenings．I rowed on the river，and waited for news from Wemmick．</p>
<p>几周来，生活过得平安无事。赫伯特去工作，晚上拜访克莱拉，我在河里划船，等着来自文米克的消息。</p>
<p>One evening，instead of reading alone in my room，I went to the theatre where Mr Wopsle was acting．He noticed me in the audience，and kept looking at me in a very strange way．After the play we met outside the theatre，and he asked immediately，</p>
<p>一天晚上，我去了戏院而不是独自在屋子里读书。伍甫赛先生正在上演，他在观众席上发现了我，用一种十分惊奇的眼神不停地看着我。演出后，我们在戏院外面相遇，他立即问我：</p>
<p>‘You didn't see that man sitting right behind you，Mr Pip？’</p>
<p>“你没看见坐在你右后面的那个人吗？匹普先生。”</p>
<p>I felt suddenly cold．‘Who was he？’I asked．</p>
<p>我突然感到寒颤起来，“他是谁？”我问道。</p>
<p>‘You remember，Mr Pip，that Christmas Day，when you were a boy？We went on to the marshes with the soldiers and found the escaped convicts fighting each other．Well，one of those two was looking over your shoulder tonight．’</p>
<p>“你记得，匹普先生，那个圣诞节，当你还是一个孩子，我们和士兵们去了沼泽地，发现两个逃犯在互相厮打。喂，那其中的一个今天晚上正在看你的肩膀。”</p>
<p>‘Which one？’I asked，holding my breath．</p>
<p>“哪一个？”我憋着呼吸问。</p>
<p>‘The one with the bleeding face，’he answered．</p>
<p>“脸上流血的那一个，”他回答说。</p>
<p>So Compeyson was still following me！I knew Magwitch was in great danger．Later that evening Herbert and I discussed the problem，and promised each other to be more careful than ever．</p>
<p>好一个康培生仍然在跟踪我！我知道马格韦契危险很大。后来，那天晚上，我和赫伯特讨论了这个问题，我们互相许诺要比以往更加小心。</p>
<p>About a week later I met Mr Jaggers by chance in the street，and he invited me to dinner that evening．Wemmick was there too．Mr Jaggers told me Miss Havisham wished to see me on business，so I said I would go the next day．</p>
<p>大约一周后，在大街上，我意外地遇见贾格斯先生。那天晚上，他邀请我吃晚饭，文米克也在那里。贾格斯先生告诉我郝薇香小姐有事希望见我。因此，我说第二天去。</p>
<p>Then Jaggers said，‘Well，Pip！Our friend Drummle has won a great prize！He has married Estella！’</p>
<p>然后，贾格斯说，“喂，匹普！我们的朋友朱穆尔赢得了一个巨大的奖品！他已经和艾丝黛拉结婚啦！”</p>
<p>I had been expecting this news for some time but it still came as a terrible shock．</p>
<p>我料想到这个消息已经有一会儿了。但是，这个消息仍然来得毛骨悚然。</p>
<p>‘I wonder，’continued Jaggers，‘who will be the stronger in the end，the wife or the husband？He may beat her—’</p>
<p>“我惊讶，”贾格斯继续说，“谁是最终强者，这个妻子还是这个丈夫？他可能击败她——”。</p>
<p>‘Surely he isn't wicked enough to do that！’I cried．</p>
<p>“他那样做确实不是最坏的！”我喊着。</p>
<p>‘He may，or he may not．But she is certainly more intelligent than him．We shall see．’</p>
<p>“他可能，或者他不可能，但是她一定比他更聪明，我们将拭目以待。”</p>
<p>Just then I noticed the housekeeper putting a dish on the table．I stared at her．I had seen exactly such eyes，and such hands，very recently！And suddenly I was absolutely certain that this woman was Estella's mother．</p>
<p>正在这时，我注意到那个女管家把一个盘子放在桌子上，我盯着她。就在最近，我确实见过这样的眼睛，这样的手！突然，我完全确信，这个女人就是艾丝黛拉的母亲。</p>
<p>Later，as Wemmick and I left Jaggers’house together，I asked him about his employer's housekeeper．He told me that，many years before，she had been jealous of her husband and another woman，and had been accused of murdering this woman．Jaggers was her lawyer，and at her trial he managed to show that she was not strong enough to kill anyone．She was also suspected of killing her three－year－old daughter，who had disappeared．But because of Jaggers’clever arguing，she was judged innocent of murder．Aftef the trial she left her husband and became Jaggers’housekeeper．</p>
<p>后来，当我和文米克一起离开贾格斯的家时，我问他有关他的雇主女管家。他告诉我，很多年以前，她猜疑她丈夫和另外一个女人好，被指控谋杀这个女人。贾格斯是她的律师，在她的判决中，他设法表明她体弱不能杀害其他人。也怀疑她杀害了3岁的女儿，她女儿已经失踪了。但是，因为贾格斯的聪明善辩，所以判决她的谋杀罪不能成立。判决后，她离开了她丈夫，成了贾格斯的女管家。</p><a href='16.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
