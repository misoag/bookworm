<p><b>10 匹普和赫伯特谈论爱情 </b></p>
<p>I returned to London， dreaming of the beautiful girl， now a woman， who had so influenced my childhood，and who， I hoped， would share my future life． I am sorry to say I did not think about dear， good Joe at all． I felt I had to ex－press my feelings to someone， and so that evening I told Herbert my secret．</p>
<p>我回到伦敦，梦见那个漂亮的姑娘，一个对我童年产生重大影响的女人，我希望和这位姑娘分享我未来的生活。我很抱歉地说，亲爱的好人乔在我心目中早已化为泡影了，我觉得必须向别人表达我的感情。因此，那天晚上，我把秘密告诉了赫伯特。</p>
<p>Instead of being surprised， as I expected， my friend replied，</p>
<p>当期望着我的朋友回答时，我大吃一惊。</p>
<p>‘I know that already， Handel．You never told me， but it was obvious．You've always loved Estella．It's very lucky that you seem to have been chosen to marry her．Does she， er，admire you？’</p>
<p>“我已经知道了，汉德尔。你从来没有告诉我，但那是显而易见的。你总是爱着艾丝黛拉，看起来你选择她和你结婚，真是十分幸运的。是她，呃，喜欢你吗？”</p>
<p>I shook my head sadly．‘Not at all． And Herbert， you may think me lucky．I have great expectations，I know．But all that depends on one person！ And I still don't really know how much I'll receive， or when！ Nothing is certain！’</p>
<p>我伤心地摇摇头，“一点也不喜欢，赫伯特，你可以认为我幸运，我有一个远大前程，我知道。但是，所有一切都靠的是一个人！我仍然搞不明白我到底会得到多少，会到什么时候！事事都拿不准！”</p>
<p>‘Now， Handel，’said Herbert cheerfully，‘don't lose hope．Mr Jaggers himself told you you would have a large fortune，didn't he？ He would never make a mistake about something like that．Anyway， you'll be twenty－one soon．Perhaps you'll discover more then．’</p>
<p>“喂，汉德尔，”赫伯特高兴地说，“不要丧失信心，贾格斯先生他自己告诉过你，你将有一大笔财富，是吗？像这种事情一样，他从来没有做错过什么事儿。无论怎样，你马上21岁了，那时，或许你会看得更透。”</p>
<p>‘Thank you，Herbert！’ I said， feeling much better．</p>
<p>“谢谢你，赫伯特！”我心情舒畅地说。</p>
<p>‘But I want to ask you something， my dear Handel，’said Herbert，looking serious for once．‘Think of Estella， and her education， and how unhappy you may be with her．Couldn't you possibly-and I'm saying this as a friend， remember-couldn't you forget about her？’</p>
<p>“但是，我要向你问点事情，亲爱的汉德尔，”赫伯特说，看上去这一次特别认真。“艾丝黛拉认为，她有教养，你和她怎么会幸福。你不可能想得通——做为一个朋友我这样说，记住——你不可能把她忘记吧？”</p>
<p>‘I know you're right， Herbert，’I said miserably，‘but I can never stop loving her．’</p>
<p>“我知道，你说得对，赫伯特，”我自悲地说，“但是，我从来不能终止爱她。”</p>
<p>‘Well， never mind！’said Herbert．‘Now I have something to tell you myself． I am engaged．’</p>
<p>“喂，别在意！”赫伯特说，“现在，我把自己的一些事情告诉你，我订婚了。”</p>
<p>‘May I ask the young lady's name？’</p>
<p>“我可以问这位年轻小姐的名字吗？”</p>
<p>‘Clara．Her mother's dead， and she lives with her father．We must keep our feelings for each other secret， because I haven't enough money to marry her yet． As soon as I start in－suring ships we can marry．’Herbert tried to look hopeful about his future， but this time he couldn't even manage his usual cheerful smile．</p>
<p>“克莱拉。她母亲去世了，和她父亲生活在一起。我们必须为我们的感情互相保密。因为，我也没有足够的钱和她结婚。我的船只保险业务一开张，我们就能结婚。”赫伯特想方设法显得他的前途有希望。但是，这一次他甚至不能控制他平时的欢乐微笑。</p>
<p>One day I received a letter which made my heart beat fast．</p>
<p>一天，我收到了一封来信，这封信让我心慌。</p>
<p>‘I am coming to London the day after tomorrow by the mid-day coach．Miss Havisham wants you to meet me．</p>
<p>“后天我乘午班马车到伦敦，郝薇香小姐要你来接我。</p>
<p>Estella．’</p>
<p>艾丝黛拉。”</p>
<p>If there had been time，I would have ordered several new suits．I ate nothing until the day arrived， and all morning I waited impatiently for the coach．She seemed more beautiful than ever， and her manner to me was very pleasant， as I took her to the house in London where Miss Havisham had arranged for her to stay． Her life seemed to be planned by Miss Havisham right down to the smallest detail．I only hoped I was part of that plan．</p>
<p>如果有时间，我会订几套新衣服。我不吃不喝直到这一天的到来；整个上午我不耐烦地等待着马车。她好像比以前更美丽了，当我带着她去郝薇香小姐已经为她在伦敦安排好的住处时，她对我的态度十分好。她的生活看起来是被郝薇香小姐操纵着，直到很小的细节，只希望我是被操纵的一部分。</p><a href='11.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
