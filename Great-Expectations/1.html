<p><b>1 匹普与一位陌生人相遇 </b></p>
<p>My first name was Philip，but when I was a small child I could only manage to say Pip．So Pip was what every-body called me．I lived in a small village in Essex with my sister，who was over twenty years older than me，and married to Joe Gargery，the village blacksmith．My parents had died when I was a baby，so I could not remember them at all，but quite often I used to visit the churchyard，abut a mile from the village，to look at their names on their gravestones．</p>
<p>我的教名叫菲利普，但是在我小时候，我仅会说匹普。因此，匹普就成了大家叫我的名字。我与姐姐住在埃森克斯的一个小村庄，姐姐比我大20多岁，她与村里的铁匠乔&middot;葛吉瑞结了婚。当我还是一个婴儿时，父母就离开了人间，所以我记不得他们的一切情况，但是，我常常去离村庄大约1英里的教堂墓地，瞻仰墓碑上他们的名字。</p>
<p>My first memory is of sitting on a gravestone in that church-yard one cold，grey，December afternoon，looking out at the dark，flat，wild marshes divided by the black line of the River Thames，and listening to the rushing sound of the sea in the distance．</p>
<p>我的最初记忆是在十二月份一个寒冷的、天色阴沉的下午，正坐在那个教堂墓地的一块墓石上。看到的是被那黑色泰晤士河分割成的一片黑压压的沼泽荒地，听到的是从远处大海刮来的嗖嗖呼啸声。</p>
<p>‘Don't say a word！’cried a terrible voice，as a man jumped up from among the graves and caught hold of me．‘If you shout I'll cut your throat！’He was a big man，dressed all in grey，with an iron chain on his leg．His clothes were wet and torn．He looked exhausted，and hungry，and very fierce．I had never been so frightened in my whole life．</p>
<p>“别出声！”一个凶恶的声音大喊起来，这时，从墓地里窜出一个人来，一把抓住我，“安静点，不然我割断你的喉咙！”他身材高大，穿着一身灰色衣服，腿上拴着一副脚镣。他的衣服湿淋淋的并且破烂不堪，看上去筋疲力劲饥寒交迫、十分凶残的样子，在我一生中从没有见过如此可怕的人。</p>
<p>‘Oh！Don't cut my throat，sir！’I begged in terror．</p>
<p>“噢！先生，不要杀我！”我害怕地乞求着。</p>
<p>‘Tell me your name，boy！Quick！’he said，still holding me．‘And show me where you live！’</p>
<p>“小子，告诉我你叫什么名字！快点！”他仍然抓着我说，‘’指给我`看你住在哪儿！”</p>
<p>‘My name's Pip，sir．And I live in the village over there．’</p>
<p>“先生，我叫匹普，我住在那边的村庄里。”</p>
<p>He picked me up and turned me upside-down．Nothing fell out of my pocket except a piece of old bread．He ate it in two bites，like a dog，and put me back on the gravestone．</p>
<p>他抓起我，又把我按倒在地。我的口袋里除了一块剩面包则一无所有，他狼吞虎咽地吃下两口，又把我放回墓石上。</p>
<p>‘So where are your father and mother？’he asked．</p>
<p>“那么，你的爸爸妈妈在哪儿？”他问道。</p>
<p>‘There，sir，’I answered，pointing to their graves．</p>
<p>“先生，在那儿，”我指着那里的坟墓回答。</p>
<p>‘What！’he cried，and was about to run，when he saw where I was pointing．‘Oh！’he said．‘ I see．They're dead．Well，who do you live with，if I let you live，which I haven't decided yet？’</p>
<p>当他看到我所指的地方时，“什么！”他叫起来拔腿就跑。“噢！”他说，“我明白了，他们已经死了。嘿，你跟谁一起生活？但是，我是否让你活着还没决定。”</p>
<p>‘With my sister，sir，wife of Joe Gargery，the blacksmith．’</p>
<p>“和我姐姐在一起，先生，铁匠乔&middot;葛吉瑞的妻子。”</p>
<p>Blacksmith，you say？And he looked down at his leg．Then he held me by both arms and stared fiercely down into my eyes．</p>
<p>“你说，铁匠？”他低下头看看自己的腿，然后抱住我，用凶狠的眼光盯着我的双眼。</p>
<p>‘Now look here．You bring me a file．You know what that is？And you bring me some food．If you don't，or if you tell anyone about me，I'll cut your heart out．’</p>
<p>“你看这儿，给我带把锉子来，你知道什么是锉吗？再给我弄点吃的，如果你办不到，或者把我的情况告诉别人，我会挖出你的心脏来。”</p>
<p>‘I promise I'll do it，sir，’I answered．I was badly fright ened and my whole body was trembling .</p>
<p>“我保证会做到的，先生。”我回答说。我非常害怕，整个身体在颤抖。</p>
<p>‘You see，’he continued，smiling unpleasantly，‘I travel with a young man，a friend of mine，who roasts boys’hearts and eats them．He'll find you，wherever you are，and he'll have your heart．So bring the file and the food to that wooden shelter over there，early tomorrow morning，if you want to keep your heart，that is Remember，you promised！’</p>
<p>“你明白，”他不高兴地冷笑着继续说，“同我一起来的还有一个年轻人，是我的朋友，他烤过小孩的心脏并把它们吃掉。不管你在哪儿，他都会找到你并吃掉你的心脏。所以，明天一大早，把带来的锉和食物送到那边的木制遮蔽体前。如果你要活命的话，那么，记住你的诺言！”</p>
<p>I watched him turn and walk with difficulty across the marshes，the chain hanging clumsily around his leg．Then I ran home as fast as I could．</p>
<p>我注视着他转过身去，脚镣悬挂在笨拙的腿上。踉踉跄跄地穿过沼泽地，这时我拼命地往家跑。</p>
<p>My sister，Mrs Joe Gargery，was very proud of the fact that she had brought me up‘by hand’．Nobody explained to me what this meant，and because she had a hard and heavy hand，which she used freely on her husband as well as me，I supposed that Joe and I were both brought up by hand．She was not a beautiful woman，being tall and thin，with black hair and eyes and a very red face．She clearly felt that Joe and I caused her a lot of trouble，and she frequently complained about it．Joe，on the other hand，was a gentle，kind man with fair hair and weak blue eyes，who quietly accepted her scolding．</p>
<p>我的姐姐，乔&middot;葛吉瑞夫人。事实上，她以“亲手”把我带大感到很自豪，没有人给我解释这意味着什么。因为，她有十分厉害、粗糙有力的手，随便用在她的丈夫及我的身上，我想像乔和我都是这样被“亲手抚养”的。她不是一个漂亮的女人，长得瘦高条，黑色的头发和眼睛，一副赤红的面孔。她确实觉得乔和我给她添了不少麻烦，常常为这些发牢骚。相反，乔是一个和蔼、心地善良的人。长有金色的头发和浅蓝色的眼睛，老老实实地听从她的训斥。</p>
<p>Because Joe and I were in the same position of being scolded by Mrs Joe，we were good friends，and Joe protected me from her anger whenever he could．So when I ran breathless into the kitchen，he gave me a friendly warning．‘She's out look-ing for you，Pip！And she's got the stick with her！’This stick had been used so often for beating me that it was now quite smooth．</p>
<p>因为我和乔都处于被乔夫人责骂的地位，我们俩是好朋友，乔随时都在保护我免遭她的怒斥。所以，当我上气不接下气地跑进厨房时，他给了我一个友好的忠告：“她正在外面找你，匹普！她还拿了条棍子！”这条棍子过去常用来敲打我，它现在是非常光滑了。</p>
<p>Just then Mrs Joe rushed in．</p>
<p>正在这时，乔夫人闯了进来。</p>
<p>‘Where have you been，you young monkey？’she shouted．I jumped behind Joe to avoid being hit with the stick．</p>
<p>“到哪里去了，你这个小淘气鬼？”她大叫着，我跳着躲到乔的背后，以避开她棍子的毒打。</p>
<p>‘Only to the churchyard，’I whispered，starting to cry．</p>
<p>“只去了教堂墓地，”我小声嘟囔着，接着哭了起来。</p>
<p>‘Churchyard！If I hadn't brought you up，you'd be in the churchyard with our parents．You'll send me to the church-yard one day！Now let me get your supper ready，both of you！’</p>
<p>“教堂墓地！如果不是我照顾你，你早就和我们的父母被埋在教堂墓地里了。有一天你会把我送到坟墓去！现在，我给你们准备晚餐，你们俩！”</p>
<p>For the rest of the evening，I thought of nothing but the stranger on the marshes．Sometimes，as the wind blew round the house，I imagined I heard his voice outside，and I thought with horror of the young man who ate boys’ hearts．</p>
<p>晚上休息时，我其它的事情都不想，只考虑沼泽地里那个陌生人。有时，当风在房屋周围掠过时，我想自己听到外面他的声音，还想起吞吃小孩子心脏的那个可怕的年轻人。</p>
<p>Just before I went to bed，we heard the sound of a big gun on the marshes．‘Was that a gun，Joe？’I asked．</p>
<p>我刚要睡觉，我们听到从沼泽地传来的一阵枪声。“乔，那枪声是干什么的？”我问道。</p>
<p>‘Ah！’said Joe．‘Another convict's escaped．One got away last night．They always fire the gun when one escapes．’</p>
<p>“噢！”乔说，“又有一个囚犯逃走了，昨晚上有一个囚犯逃跑了。当有囚犯逃跑时，他们总是要开火”。</p>
<p>‘Who fires the gun？’I asked．Joe shook his head to warn me．</p>
<p>“向谁开的枪？”我问道，乔摇摇头警告我。</p>
<p>‘Too many questions，’frowned my sister．‘If you must know it's the men in the prison-ships who fire the gun．’</p>
<p>“问得太多了，”我的姐姐皱着眉头说，“你要是知道关在船上监狱的那些人，就明白向谁开枪了。”</p>
<p>‘I wonder who is put into prison-ships，and why？’I asked，in a general way，quietly desperate to know the answer．</p>
<p>“我想知道谁被关在船上监狱里，为什么他们被关在那里？”我追问道，通常，我非常想知道这类问题的答案。</p>
<p>This was too much for Mrs Joe．‘Listen，my boy，I didn't bring you up by hand to annoy people to death！There are ships on the river which are used as prisons．People who steal and murder are put in the prison-ships，and they stay there for years sometimes．And they always begin their life of crime by asking too many questions！Now，go to bed！’</p>
<p>对于乔夫人来说，这是问得太多了，“听着，我的孩子，我不让你跌入绝望和死亡的深渊！在那条河里有一些船专门用其当监狱，小偷和杀人犯被关在那些船上监狱里，有时他们在那里要呆上很多年。而且，他们通常在他们犯罪开始的时候总是会提出许多为什么！喂，睡觉去！”</p>
<p>I could not sleep at all that night．I was in terror of the young man who wanted my heart，I was in terror of the man with the iron chain，I was in terror of my sister，who would soon discover I had stolen her food．As soon as there was a lit-tle light in the sky outside my window， I got up and went qui-etly down to the kitchen．I stole some bread，cheese and a big meat pie，hoping that，as there was a lot of food ready for Christmas，nobody would notice what was missing．I did not dare take the whole brandy bottle，so I poured some into a smaller bottle to take away with me．Then I filled up the brandy bottle with what I thought was water from a big brown bottle．I took a file from Joe's box of tools，and ran out on to the dark marshes．</p>
<p>那天晚上，我彻夜未眠，在想要吃我心脏的那个凶恶的年轻人，在想带着脚镣的那个凶狠的人，在想我那可怕的姐姐，马上就会发现我偷了她的食物。外面的天空透过窗户刚出现朦朦的亮，我就起了床，悄悄地下了楼进了厨房。我偷了一些面包、黄油和一大块肉饼。因为，为过圣诞节准备了许多吃的，希望没有人会发现少了东西。我没敢拿整瓶的白兰地酒，而是倒了一些盛在小瓶里带上了。然后，我用自己认为是盛水的大褐色瓶子里的水把白兰地瓶子倒满。我从乔的工具盒里拿了一把锉，随之跑出了家门，直奔黑压压的沼泽地。</p>
<p>The mist was so thick that I could not see anything．Al-though I knew my way to the shelter very well，I almost got lost this time．I was near it when I saw a man sitting on the ground，half asleep．I went up and touched his shoulder．He jumped up，and it was the wrong man！He was dressed in grey，too，and had an iron chain on his leg．He ran away into the mist．</p>
<p>大雾弥漫，伸手不见五指。虽然我对去遮蔽体的路了如指掌，但这次几乎是迷了路。我接近遮蔽体时，看见一个人坐在地上，几乎睡着了。我走过去，拍拍他的肩膀，他一跃而起。他不是我遇见的那个人！他也穿着灰布衣服，腿上也戴着一副脚镣。他逃跑到浓雾之中。</p>
<p>‘It's the young man！’I thought，feeling a pain in my heart．</p>
<p>“就是那个年轻人！”我想，心里很害怕。</p>
<p>When I arrived at the shelter，I found the right man．He looked so cold and hungry that I felt sorry for him．Trembling violently he swallowed the brandy and ate the food like a hunt-ed animal，looking around him all the time for danger．</p>
<p>当我到达那个遮蔽体时，找到了第一个囚犯。他看上去饥寒交迫，我为他感到很内疚。他好像恶狼一样，抖抖嗦嗦地往嘴里填着食物，喝着白兰地。</p>
<p>‘You're sure you didn't tell anyone？Or bring anyone？’</p>
<p>“你保证你没告诉任何人？没有带任何人来吧？”</p>
<p>‘No，sir．I'm glad you're enjoying the food，sir．’</p>
<p>“没有，先生，你吃得这么有滋味，我真高兴，先生。”</p>
<p>‘Thank you，my boy．You've been good to a poor man．’</p>
<p>“谢谢你，我的孩子。你给一个穷苦人办了一件好事。”</p>
<p>‘But I'm afraid there won't be any left for him．’</p>
<p>“我很害怕，没有留点吃的给他。”</p>
<p>‘Him？ Who's that？’My friend stopped in the middle of eating．</p>
<p>“他？谁呀？”我的朋友停下吃了半截的东西问道。</p>
<p>‘The young man who travels with you．’</p>
<p>“就是和你一起来的那个小伙子。”</p>
<p>‘Oh，him！’he replied，smiling．‘He doesn't want any food．’</p>
<p>“噢，他吗！”他讥笑着说，“他是不吃东西的。”</p>
<p>‘I thought he looked rather hungry，’I answered．</p>
<p>“我看他的样子很饿，”我回答说。</p>
<p>He stared at me in great surprise．‘Looked？When？’</p>
<p>他十分惊讶的盯着我，“看样子？什么时候？”</p>
<p>‘Just now，over there．I found him half asleep and I thought it was you．He was dressed like you，and—’I was anxious to express this politely‘-he had the same reason for wanting to borrow a file．’</p>
<p>“刚才，在那边儿。我发现他正在打瞌睡，开始我还认为是你呢。他穿的衣服和您一样，还有……”我犹豫了一下，用这种文雅的表达方式，“……他有一个同样的理由，要借一把锉。”</p>
<p>‘Then I did hear them fire the gun last night！You know，boy，when you're on the marsh alone at night，you imagine all kinds of things，voices calling，guns firing，soldiers marching！But show me where this man went．I'll find him and I'll fin-ish with him！I'll smash his face！Give me the file first．’</p>
<p>“而且，我昨晚听到了他们的枪声！你知道，孩子，当你在晚上独自一人在沼泽地里，你想想，所有形形色色的东西，尖叫声，枪击声，士兵们向前挺进！指给我这个人去的路，我会找到他，结束他的性命！打烂他的脸！先给我锉。”</p>
<p>I was afraid of him now that he was angry again．</p>
<p>他再一次发怒，我现在很怕他。</p>
<p>‘I'm sorry，I must go home now，’I said．He did not seem to hear，so I left him bending over his leg and filing away at his iron chain like a madman．Halfway home I stopped in the mist to listen，and I could still hear the sound of the file．</p>
<p>“对不起，我现在该回家了，”我说，他似乎没听到，他头冲着膝盖，像一个疯子一样，正往下锉脚镣。因此，我趁机溜走，回家的半路上我在浓雾中停住了脚步，听听声音，我仍然能听到锉脚镣的声音。</p><a href='2.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
