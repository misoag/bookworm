<p><b>6 远大前程 </b></p>
<p>One Saturday evening，when I had been apprenticed to Joe for four years，he and I were sitting in the pub，with some of the villagers, listening to Mr Wopsle．He was giving a dramatic reading of a newspaper report of a murder trial, and we all enjoyed watching him act the main characters. His witnesses were old and feeble，his lawyers were clever and sharp-eyed，and his accused was a violent，wicked murderer.</p>
<p>我作为乔的徒弟已经干了4年。有一个星期六的晚上，他和我还有一些村民正坐在小酒店里，聆听伍甫赛先生读报，他正在大声朗读报纸上的谋杀案审判报告，我们都欣赏地看着他扮演主要角色。他的证据是陈旧无力的，他的律师们聪明机灵有锐利的眼光，他的指控是猛烈的，老奸巨猾的谋杀者。</p>
<p>Suddenly we became aware of a strange gentleman who had also been listening，and was now looking coldly at us.</p>
<p>突然，我们注意到一位陌生人也在听讲。现在，正冷眼看着我们。</p>
<p>‘Well！’he said to us，biting the side of his finger.‘So you've decided the accused was the murderer，have you？'</p>
<p>“喂！”他边咬着手指边对我们说，“这样你们就决定指控他是谋杀者，对吗？”</p>
<p>‘Sir，'answered Mr Wopsle firmly，‘yes，I do think he is guilty.’We all nodded our heads in agreement.</p>
<p>“先生，”伍甫赛先生紧接着回答，“是的，我想他是有罪的。”我们都点点头表示同意。</p>
<p>‘But，’said the stranger，‘do you or do you not know that the law of England supposes every man to be innocent until he is proved-proved-to be guilty？’</p>
<p>“但是，”陌生人说，“你们知不知道英国的法律，推测每个人是无罪的，直到他被证实——证实——是无罪的？”</p>
<p>‘Sir，’began Mr Wopsle，‘as an Englishman myself，I-’</p>
<p>“先生，”伍甫赛先生开始说，“我自己作为一个英国人，我——”</p>
<p>‘Come！’said the stranger，‘don't avoid the question．Either you know it，or you don't know it．Which is it？’</p>
<p>“得啦！”陌生人说，“不要回避这个问题，你知道，还是不知道，那一条？”</p>
<p>‘Of course I know it，’answered poor Mr Wopsle.</p>
<p>“我当然知道，”可怜的伍甫赛先生回答。</p>
<p>‘Then why didn't you say so at first？Another question. Do you know that this trial isn't finished yet？’</p>
<p>“那你为什么开始不这样讲？还有一个问题，你还知道这不是最终判决吧？”</p>
<p>Mr Wopsle hesitated，and we all began to have a rather bad opinion of him .</p>
<p>伍甫赛先生踌躇着，我们大家开始对他产生特别不好的看法。</p>
<p>‘And you were going to say that the accused was guilty，before the end of the trial，before he has been proved guilty！’We realized that the unfortunate Wopsle had no understanding of the law，or indeed anything at all.</p>
<p>最终判决之前，“你打算说那个指控是无罪的，已经证明他无罪之前！”我们认识到，不幸的伍甫赛不了解法律，或者说一点不懂。</p>
<p>Now the stranger stood in front of our little group.</p>
<p>现在，那个陌生人站在我们一小群人前面。</p>
<p>‘I'm looking for the blacksmith，Joe Gargery，’he said，‘and his apprentice，Pip．’He did not recognize me but I knew he was the gentleman I had met on the stairs when visiting Miss Havisham. There was even the same smell of per－fumed soap on his large hands.‘I want to speak to you two in private，’he said，and so Joe and I left the pub and walked home with him．</p>
<p>“我正在寻找铁匠乔&middot;葛吉瑞，”他说，“和他的徒弟，匹普”。他没有认出我来，可是我知道他是我拜访郝薇香小姐时，在楼梯上遇见的那个绅士，甚至还能闻到他那双大手上的香皂味。“我要秘密地对你们俩说，”他说。因此，乔和我同他一起离开小酒店走回家。</p>
<p>‘My name is Jaggers，and I'm a lawyer，’he said，when he reached the forge．‘Joe Gargery，I am sent by someone who suggests cancelling this boy's apprenticeship to you．Would you want any money，if you lost your apprentice？'</p>
<p>“我叫贾格斯，是一名律师，”当到达铁匠铺时，他说，“乔&middot;葛吉瑞，我是由别人派来的，这个人提出取消这个孩子做你徒弟之约，如果你失去你的徒弟，要不要钱？”</p>
<p>‘I'd never stand in Pip's way，never，'said Joe，staring.‘The answer is no.’</p>
<p>“我从来没有阻止匹普走，从来没有，”乔盯着我说，“回答是没有”。</p>
<p>‘Don't try to change that answer later，’said Mr Jaggers .‘Now，what I have to say，and remember，I'm only an agent，I don't speak for myself，is that this young man has great expectations.’</p>
<p>“以后别想改变这一回答，”贾格斯先生说，“喂，这一点我必须说，记住，我只是一个代理人，我不是代表我自己讲话，这个年轻人要有远大前程啦。”</p>
<p>Joe and I gasped，and looked at each other.</p>
<p>我和乔气喘吁吁，相对而视。</p>
<p>‘I have been told to say that he will be very rich when he is older.In addition，the person who sent me wants the young man to be removed from his home and educated as a gentleman who expects to inherit a fortune.'</p>
<p>“我已经被告之，当他大一点，将成为百万富翁。另外，指派我的那个人要这位年轻人从他家里迁移出来并接受上等教育，成为一名期待继承一笔财富的绅士。”</p>
<p>My dream had come true. Miss Havisham was making me rich！</p>
<p>我的梦想变成了现实，郝薇香小姐正在让我富有起来！</p>
<p>‘Now，Mr Pip，’continued the lawyer，‘there are two conditions．The first is that you always use the name of Pip．The second is that the name of the person who has heen so generous to you must remain a secret，until that person chooses to tell you．You are forbidden to ask any questions or try to discover who the person is．Do you accept these conditions？</p>
<p>“喂，匹普先生，”这位律师接着说，“有两个条件：首先，你永远使用匹普这个名字。第二，对你如此慷慨的那个人的名字必须保秘，直到时机成熟了，那个人会告诉你的。禁止你问任何问题，或想发现这个人是谁，你接受这些条件吗？”</p>
<p>My heart was beating fast as I whispered，‘Yes '.</p>
<p>当我小声说“接受”时，我的心脏快跳出来了。</p>
<p>‘Now，to details．I have been given enough money for you to live the life of a gentleman in London while you are studying .You will come to me to ask for whatever you need .I suggest Mr Matthew Pocket as a teacher．’I remembered that was the name of one of Miss Havisham 's relations，the one who did not visit her often．‘ You must buy some new clothes．Shall I leave you twenty pounds？’He counted twenty coins out of his large purse onto the table．‘And when can you come to London？Next Saturday？’</p>
<p>“喂，讲点细节问题，当你正在学习时，我要给你在伦敦过一个绅士生活的足够费用，你无论需要什么都来向我要。我建议马修&middot;朴凯特作为一名教师。”我记起来了，这是郝薇香小姐其中一个亲戚的名字，这个亲戚不常看她。“你必须买几件新衣眼，我留给你20镑吧。”他从大钱袋里数出20个硬币放在桌子上，“你什么时间能动身去伦敦？下星期六？”</p>
<p>I agreed，feeling very confused．He looked at Joe，who seemed even more confused.</p>
<p>我感到十分迷惑，同意了。他看了看乔，乔好像更迷惑不解。</p>
<p>‘Well，Joe Gargery？Perhaps，I only say perhaps，I promise nothing，’he said，throwing his purse carelessly from one hand to another，‘perhaps I have been told to give you a present when you lose your apprentice．'</p>
<p>“喂，乔&middot;葛吉瑞，或许，我只讲或许，我没有什么许诺，”他漫不经心地从一只手到另一只手扔着他的钱袋说，“也许我已经讲过，当你失去你的徒弟时，给你一份礼品。”</p>
<p>Joe put his great strong hand on my shoulder in the gentlest possible way . ‘Pip can go freely to fortune and happiness，he knows that．But if you think that money can ever pay me back for losing the little child－who came to the forge－and always the best of friends！’He could not continue.</p>
<p>乔把他那粗壮有力的手轻轻地搭在我的肩上，“匹普，你能自由自在地享受富贵和幸福，他知道这一点。不过，你认为用金钱就能买回我失去的——来铁匠铺的这个小孩子——永远是最知心的朋友！”他再也说不下去了。</p>
<p>Dear good Joe！I was so ready to leave you，and so ungrateful to you！I can see you now，with your strong blacksmith's arm in front of your eyes，and your shoulders shaking，and tears on your cheeks. But at the time I was so excited by my good luck that I forgot what I owed to Joe. Mr Jaggers clearly thought Joe was a fool for refusing money，and left the house，reminding me to go straight to his office in London in a week's time.</p>
<p>亲爱的好人乔！我竟会这样地准备离开你，甚至来不及感谢你！现在，我能看到在你眼前用那强壮的铁匠手臂捂着双眼，你的肩膀颤抖着，脸颊挂着泪水。但是，我的好运使我如此兴奋，我忘记要感谢乔。贾格斯先生虽然认为乔拒绝要钱是一个大傻瓜，并提醒我在一周内直接到他的办公室那里，接着离开了我们。</p>
<p>Joe told Biddy what had happened，and both congratulated me. They were very quiet and sad at first，because I would be leaving them，but I promised I would never forget them and would often return to visit them. Biddy tried to explain the good news to my sister，but the poor woman could not under-stand．</p>
<p>乔告诉了毕蒂所发生的一切，两人祝贺我。因为我将离开他们，开始，他们很平静。很伤心，而我许愿永远不会忘记他们，会经常回来看望他们。毕蒂设法告诉我姐姐这条好消息，但是，这个可怜的女人不能理解。</p>
<p>As Joe and Biddy became a little more cheerful，discussing my possible plans for the future，I became more miserable. Now that I could be a gentleman，as I had always wished，I was not sure if I wanted to leave my home，which was full of happy memories.</p>
<p>当乔和毕蒂变得高兴一点儿时，开始讨论我未来可能的计划，我变得更悲惨了。现在，我能够做一个绅士，像我永远希望的那样，我不能肯定，我要离开家时是否是充满着幸福的回忆。</p>
<p>That week passed slowly. I took a last walk through the churchyard to the marshes．At least I need never think about my convict again. No doubt he was dead by now.</p>
<p>那一周过得很慢，我穿过教堂墓地去了沼泽地做最后一次散步。至少再也不用想我那个囚犯了，无疑他现在已经归天了。</p>
<p>I had something special to ask Biddy.‘Biddy，’I said，when we were alone，‘don't you think you could teach Joe a bit？’</p>
<p>我有些特殊的事情要问毕蒂。“毕蒂，”当只是我们俩时，我说，“你想你不能教乔一点东西吗？”</p>
<p>‘What do you mean，teach him？’asked Biddy.</p>
<p>“你什么意思，教他？”毕蒂问。</p>
<p>‘Well，I love dear old Joe more than anyone else，but his education and manners could be improved.’</p>
<p>“对，我亲爱的老乔胜似其他人，不过，要改善他的教育和举止。”</p>
<p>Biddy opened her eyes very wide．‘Oh？’she said.‘So his manners aren't good enough，then？’</p>
<p>毕蒂眼睛睁得很大，“噢？”她说，“照这么说他的举止不够好，是吗？”</p>
<p>‘Oh，they're all right for here，but when I receive my for－tune，I'll want him to meet important people，and behave ocrrectly.’</p>
<p>“噢，做得挺好。不过，当我接到钱财时，我打算让他去见重要人物，举止要规范。”</p>
<p>Haven't you ever thought，’asked Biddy，not looking at me，‘that he wouldn't want to meet important people，he wouldn't want to be taken away from this job that he does well，and the village where he's loved？’</p>
<p>“你过去不这样想，”毕蒂没有看我，问：“他不想去见重要人物，他不想从干得挺好的这项工作中离去，这个村庄非常需要他？”</p>
<p>‘Now，Biddy，’I said crossly，‘are you jealous of my good luck？I didn't expect this of you．This is a bad side of your character，Biddy.’</p>
<p>“喂，毕蒂，”我不高兴地说，“你嫉妒我的好运吗？我不期望你这样，这是你性格不好的一面，毕蒂。”</p>
<p>‘Whether you scold me or thank me，I'll always do my best for the family at all times．And I'll always remember you，whatever you think of me，’said poor Biddy.</p>
<p>“不管你责骂我还是感谢我，我都将每时每刻为这个家做出一流的奉献，我将永远记着你，不管你想不想我。”可怜的毕蒂说。</p>
<p>I was not pleased with this interview，and thought it was strange that the news of my expectations had not made me happier.</p>
<p>这次会面我不高兴，想想真奇怪，我的远大前程的消息没有让我更快乐一点儿。</p>
<p>When I went into town to order my new clothes， Mr Pumblechook was waiting for me at the door of his shop．</p>
<p>当我来到镇上定做新衣服时，潘波趣先生正在商店门口等着我。</p>
<p>‘My dear friend， if you will allow me to call you that，’ he cried，shaking both my hands，‘let me congratulate you on your fortune！ Nobody deserves it more than you！’He seemed so much more sensible than before that I agreed to have lunch with him．</p>
<p>“我亲爱的朋友，你是否允许我这样称呼你，”他摇晃着我的双手喊着，“让我为你的好运祝贺！没有人比你得到的更多！”他似乎比以前更通情达理得多，我同意和他吃午饭。</p>
<p>‘When I think，’ he said happily，‘that I，Pumblechook，was able to help in my small way， by taking you to play at Miss-’</p>
<p>“当我想起，”他高兴地说，“我，潘波趣，小小的帮助，领着你到小姐家去玩”。</p>
<p>‘Remember，’I stopped him， ‘we must never say anything about the person who is being so generous to me．’</p>
<p>“记住，”我打断他的话，“有关对我如此慷慨的那个人，我们从来不会说任何事情。”</p>
<p>‘Don't worry， trust me， my dear friend Have some wine，have some chicken！Oh chicken，you didn't think when you were running around on the farm that you would be lucky enough to be served to one who－May I？May I？’ and he jumped up to shake my hand again．</p>
<p>“别担心，相信我，我亲爱的朋友，喝些葡萄酒，吃些鸡！噢，鸡，你没有想，当你围着田地跑时，有人为他效力，你够幸运的，我可以吗？我可以吗？”他跳起来，又摇动着我的手。</p>
<p>As we drank our wine， Pumblechook reminded me of the happy times he and I had spent together during my childhood．I did not remember it quite like that， but I began to feel he was a good-hearted， sincere man． He wanted to ask my advice on a business matter．He said he was hoping to find a young gentleman who would put money into his business， and seemed very interested in my opinion．‘And may I？May I？’He shook hands with me again．</p>
<p>当我们喝了葡萄酒，潘波趣想起我快乐的时代，他和我一起度过我的童年。我记得不完全是这样，不过，我开始觉得他是一个好心肠、诚实的人。在生意上，他想问我的意见。他说，他正希望找一个会把资金投入到他的生意中的年轻人，好像对我的看法很感兴趣。“可以吗？可以吗？”他再一次摇晃着我的手。</p>
<p>‘You know， I always used to say，“That boy will make his fortune． He's no ordinary boy．”’He had certainly kept his opinion very secret， I thought．</p>
<p>“你知道，我过去常说：‘那孩子会走运的，他不是一个普通的孩子’”我想，他的看法确实很神密。</p>
<p>There was one person I really wanted to visit before going to London．Dressed in my new clothes I went to Miss Havisham's house，where her cousin opened the gate to me again．</p>
<p>去伦敦之前，有一个人我的确要去拜访。我穿上新衣服，去了郝薇香小姐府上，给我开大门的又是她的表妹。</p>
<p>‘Well， Pip？’said Miss Havisham to me when she saw me．</p>
<p>“喂，匹普？”当郝薇香小姐看到我时说。</p>
<p>‘I'm going to London tomorrow， Miss Havisham，’I said，choosing my words carefully，‘and I wanted to say goodbye．I've been so lucky since I saw you last，and I'm so grateful for it！’</p>
<p>“我准备明天去伦敦，郝薇香小姐。”我仔细地挑了几句话说，“我想说告别了，自从上次见到你，我就交上好运啦。为此，我很感激！”</p>
<p>‘Good， good！’ she replied， looking delightedly at her cousin who was staring at my new clothes．‘I know about it．I've seen Mr Jaggers．So，a rich person has adopted you？’</p>
<p>“很好，很好，”她回答说，显得很高兴地看着她的表妹，她正在盯着我的新衣服，“这件事我知道，我见过贾格斯先生啦。那么，一个富有的人收养你啦？”</p>
<p>‘Yes， Miss Havisham．’</p>
<p>“是的，郝薇香小姐。”</p>
<p>She smiled cruelly at her cousin， who was looking rather ill．</p>
<p>她冷冷地对她的表妹付之一笑，她的表妹看上去，气色相当不好。</p>
<p>‘Remember to do what Mr Jaggers tells you．And you will always keep the name of Pip，won't you？Goodbye，Pip．’She gave me her hand and I kissed it．It seemed the natural thing to do． And so I left the old lady in her bride's dress in the candle-light， with the dusty furniture around her．</p>
<p>“记住按照贾格斯先生告诉你的去做，你将永远保留匹普的名字，对吗？再见，匹普。”她向我伸出手来，我吻了她的手，这样做似乎是很自然的事情。这样，我离开了在烛光下穿着新娘礼服、周围是尘封的家具的这位老夫人。</p>
<p>On Saturday morning I was in such a hurry that I only said a quick goodbye to my family， before setting out to walk the few miles into town for the London coach． As I left the peaceful sleeping village， the mist over the marshes was rising，to show me the great unknown world I was entering． Suddenly I realized what I was leaving behind－my childhood， my home，and Joe． Then I wished I had asked him to walk with me to the coach， and I could not stop crying． Whenever the horses were changed on the journey， I wondered with an aching heart whether to get down and go back to say goodbye properly．But the mist had completely risen now， and my new world lay ahead of me．</p>
<p>星期天的早晨，要走几英里到镇上乘去伦敦的马车，出发之前，我急急忙忙地要走，以便赶快和家里的人说再见。当我离开这个宁静沉睡的村庄时，笼罩着沼泽地的迷雾正在升起，它向我显示，我正进入这神秘的大千世界。突然我意识到，我正在离开已成为过去的——我的童年，我的家和乔。这时，我希望我要求他和我一起走去坐马车，我不能停止喊叫。在旅途中，无论什么时候换乘马车，我良心上在想能不能让我下车，回过头来礼貌地说声再见。但是，现在大雾已经完全升起来了，并笼罩着前面给我铺设的新世界。</p><a href='7.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
