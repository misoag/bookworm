<p>'It's not true，Christine．Simon's information is wrong．'</p>
<p>“这不是真的，克里斯汀，西蒙的消息是错误的。”</p>
<p>'I don't believe you，Father．'</p>
<p>“我不相信你，爸爸。”</p>
<p>John and Christine stared at each other angrily．It was a miserable，frightening moment for them both．It was a night three months after the wedding，and Christine had come with some happy news．She had come to tell her father that she was going to have a baby—his first grandchild！For a while they had talked about that，but then Christine had begun to talk about Simon's new job．Simon had found some information about the waste products from the paint factory．His informa-tion was dangerous for the company．Simon had written an ar-ticle in the newspaper，saying that waste products from the paint factory could be killing the baby seals．David Wilson had written to the newspaper immediately，saying that Simon's article was completely untrue．</p>
<p>约翰和克里斯汀互相怒视着。这对他们俩都是一个痛苦恐怖的时刻。这事发生在婚礼后3个月的一个夜晚，克里斯汀带回一些令人高兴的消息，她回来告诉她父亲她将要有小宝宝——他的第一个外孙或外孙女！他们就此谈论了一会儿，但是过后克里斯汀开始谈论西蒙的新工作。西蒙发现一些有关油漆厂废料的消息。他的消息对公司有威胁。西蒙在报纸上写了一篇文章，说来自油漆厂的废料可能正在杀死幼豹。大卫&middot;威尔逊马上写信给报纸，说西蒙的文章完全是不真实的。</p>
<p>And so instead of talking happily about the baby，Christine and her father had argued all evening．John had known for a long time that they would have this argument．And next week in the town there would be a Public Enquiry，when govern-ment officials would try to discover the truth．Scientists and lawyers would speak on both sides of the argument．Everyone in the town was talking about the Enquiry—and about Simon's newspaper article．</p>
<p>所以，克里斯汀和父亲并没有高兴地谈论孩子，而是争论了整个晚上。约翰早就知道他们会有这场争论。下星期镇上将举行一个公众听证会，那时政府官员将努力发现事实真相。科学家和律师们将为双方的争议辩护。镇上所有的人都在谈论这次听证会——也谈论西蒙的报刊文章。</p>
<p>'Why did David Wilson write to the paper，Father？'Chris-tine asked．'He's not a scientist，he's just a businessman．Why didn't you write to the paper？'</p>
<p>“为什么大卫&middot;威尔逊给报纸写信，爸爸？”克里斯汀问道。“他不是一个科学家，他只是一个商人。为什么你不给报纸写信？”</p>
<p>'I have written to the paper，'said John，sadly．'You'll probably read my letter tomorrow．'</p>
<p>“我已经给报纸写过，”约翰痛心地说，“你明天也许会读到我的信。”</p>
<p>'Oh．What did you say？'Christine asked．</p>
<p>“哦。你是怎么说的？”克里斯汀问。</p>
<p>John felt sad．He hadn't wanted to write the letter．He and David Wilson had had a big argument about it．But in the end he had agreed．He had agreed to hide many bad things before，so one more didn't make any difference．</p>
<p>约翰感到痛苦。他原不想写这封信。他和大卫&middot;威尔逊为此大吵了一常但最后他还是同意了。他以前曾同意隐瞒许多坏事，所以再多一次也无妨。</p>
<p>'I said that our waste products don't make the river water dangerous．We've tested them very carefully for many years，and if they are diluted in water，they are not dangerous at all．There are usually only one and a half parts per million in the river water，that's all．And the seals aren't in the river．They're out at sea．I wrote that in my letter，and I'll say the same thing at the Enquiry next week．'</p>
<p>“我说我们的废料没有对河水造成危害。我们已经谨慎地测试了许多年。如果它们被水稀释，它们根本没有危险。在河水中废料通常仅占一百万分之一点五，仅此而已。而海豹不在河里。他们远在海里。我在信中写了这些，在下周的听证会上我会说同样的话。”</p>
<p>Christine was watching him carefully as he spoke．She saw how tired and sad his face was．He was looking at his hands most of the time，not at her．</p>
<p>在他讲话时克里斯汀认真地望着他。她看到他的脸是那样疲倦和悲伤。他大部分时间一直看着他的手，而没有看着她。</p>
<p>'Father，I want to believe you．But I can't，'she said soft-ly．</p>
<p>“爸爸，我想相信你。但我不能，”她轻声地说。</p>
<p>He looked up．'Don't then！'he said angrily．'You believe Simon，if you want to！He's a journalist，after all—I'm only a biologist，and your father．Why should you believe me？'He stood up angrily，walked to the door，and opened it．'I'm sor-ry，Christine．I've had a hard day，I'm tired，and I don't want to sit here listening to my daughter telling me I'm a liar．Go home to Simon．I'm going to bed！'</p>
<p>他抬起头。“那就别相信，”他气愤地说，“如果你愿意，你就相信西蒙好了！他毕竟是一个记者——我只是一个生物学家和你的父亲。你为什么要相信我呢？”他气愤地站起来，朝房门走去，打开门说：“对不起，克里斯汀，我这一天太艰难了，我累了。我不想坐在这儿听我女儿说我撒谎。回家找西蒙去吧，我要睡了。”</p>
<p>She got up slowly．'It's important，Father，'she said slowly．'It's important for everyone．'</p>
<p>她慢慢站起来。“这很重要，爸爸，”她缓慢地说，“这对每个人都重要。”</p>
<p>'I know it is，Christine．But the paint factory's important too．It's given a lot to you，and me，and to the people of this town．Try to remember that，and forget about the seals for a while，can't you？'</p>
<p>“我知道它重要，克里斯停但是油漆厂也重要。它给了你很多，也给了我和这个城镇的居民很多。难道你就不能试着记住这点，而暂时忘却海豹吗？”</p>
<p>'There are more important things than money，Father．'</p>
<p>“有比钱更重要的东西，爸爸。”</p>
<p>'Are there？You tell that to all the people who work in the company，and live in this town．What are they going to live on，when the factory's closed because of Simon's stupid arti-cles？Can they give their children photographs of baby seals to eat？'</p>
<p>“有吗？你把这话告诉所有在公司工作、住在镇上的人。当工厂由于西蒙那些愚蠢的文章而关闭时，他们将靠什么生存？他们能给孩子们幼豹的照片充饥吗？”</p>
<p>Christine looked at him for a long moment before she went out of the door．'And what about children who play by the river，Father？What if they drink the river water？What then？'</p>
<p>克里斯汀望着他许久以后才走出门。“那么在河边玩的孩子们怎么办，爸爸？他们如果喝了河水怎么办？那时该怎么办？”</p>
<p>'Nobody drinks water from that part of the river，'he said．'And I've told you—it isn't dangerous to children．'</p>
<p>“没人会喝那个地方的河水，”他说，“并且我已告诉过你，那对孩子们没有危险。”</p>
<p>Christine closed the door quietly behind her．</p>
<p>克里斯汀轻轻地将门在身后关上。</p><a href='10.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
