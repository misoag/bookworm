<p><b>10 绿色世界 </b></p>
<p>Two days 1ater Christine and Simon arrived at John's house．It was very early—five o'clock in the morning —and they didn't knock at the door，or try to wake anyone up．In fact John wasn't there；Christine knew he had gone to Scotland to see Mary．He was coming back on the morning of the Enquiry．</p>
<p>两天过后克里斯汀和西蒙到达约翰的家。时间很早——早晨5点——他们没有敲门，也不想吵醒任何人。事实上约翰不在。克里斯汀知道他去苏格兰看玛丽了。他将在听证会那天早晨回来。</p>
<p>Christine and Simon walked quietly down to the boathouse by the river．Without talking，they put the boat in the water，and sailed away across the river．</p>
<p>克里斯汀和西蒙悄悄地走向河边的船屋。没有交谈，他们将船放入水中，向河对岸划去。</p>
<p>On the other side of the river they met two friends，Peter and Susan．Their friends were wearing white clothes，with Greenworld written on them．Simon and Christine also put on white clothes．Then they all got into the boat and sailed up-stream，towards the paint factory．</p>
<p>在河的另一边他们与两个朋友——彼得和苏珊——会面了。他们的朋友身穿白色衣服，上面写着绿色世界。西蒙和克里斯汀也穿上白衣服。然后他们全部上船向上游油漆厂的方向驶去。</p>
<p>It was a windy morning，and the waves on the river were quite big．But Christine was a good sailor，and in about half an hour，they reached the factory．Two photographers stood by the river，taking photos of them．</p>
<p>这天早晨风很大，河中波涛滚滚，但是克里斯汀是一个优秀的水手，大约半小时，他们就到达了工厂。两名摄影师站在河边拍下了他们。</p>
<p>'OK，Simon，where is it？'shouted Christine．</p>
<p>“好啦，西蒙，它在哪？”克里斯汀喊道。</p>
<p>'Over there，look—in front of that post！'he said．Chris-tine sailed the boat towards the post．When they were near it，they could see under the water．It was the pipe that took the waste products out of the factory．</p>
<p>“在那儿，看啊，在柱子前面！”他说道。克里斯汀将船向柱子划去。当他们靠近时，他们可以看见水下，那是从工厂排放出废料的管子。</p>
<p>'OK，here！'shouted Simon．Christine turned the boat to-wards the wind，and Susan caught hold of the post．Then Si- mon and Peter climbed out of the boat into the water．</p>
<p>“好啦，在这里！”西蒙喊道。克里斯汀把船转向顺风，苏珊抓住柱子。然后西蒙和彼得爬出船跳入水中。</p>
<p>The water was moving fast here，and they had to hold onto the pipe and the boat．Peter then took several strong paper bags out of the boat．The bags were small but very heavy，be-cause they were filled with building cement．Peter passed the bags one at a time to Simon，and Simon went down under the water and pushed each bag into the pipe．A few minutes later the mouth of the pipe was full of bags of cement．</p>
<p>这里的水流很急，他们不得不抓住管子和船。彼得这时从船中拿出一些结实的纸袋。这些袋子很小但很沉，因为它们充满了建筑水泥。彼得把袋子一个个地递给西蒙，而西蒙钻到水下，把每个袋子推进管子。几分钟后，管子口已塞满了水泥袋。</p>
<p>Simon came up out of the water for the last time．'It's OK！'he shouted．'We've done it！The cement is wet already，and in a few hours it'll be as hard as a rock．Nothing can come out of that pipe now！'the two men climbed back in-to the boat and smiled at the photographers．Then Simon stood up in the boat with Christine，and held up a long white sheet．On the sheet was written：</p>
<p>西蒙最后一次从水中出来。“行啦，”他喊道，“我们干完啦！水泥已经浸透，过几个小时它将跟岩石一样硬。现在管子里再也排不出任何东西了。”两个人爬回到船上，对着摄影师笑了。然后，西蒙和克里斯汀在船上站起来，举起一长幅白纸，上面写着：</p>
<p>GREENWORLD</p>
<p>绿色世界</p>
<p>This pipe kills seals！</p>
<p>这条管道残杀海豹！</p>
<p>At that moment two things happened．A man ran out of the factory，shouting angrily．And the wind suddenly became stronger．It caught the sail and sent it quickly from one side of the boat to the other．The back of the sail hit Christine hard on the back of the head．She fell into the water，like a bag of potatoes．Then the wind caught the sail again and threw it back across the boat．This time the boat fell over on its side and lay with its sail under the water．</p>
<p>在那一时刻发生了两件事情。一个人跑出工厂愤怒地叫喊。风突然刮得更猛。风扯倒了帆，迅速把它从船的一边刮到另一边。帆的尾部沉重地打在克里斯汀头的后部，她像一袋土豆一样栽入水中。然后风又把帆掀起抛到船的另一边。这次船侧翻与帆一同沉入水底。</p>
<p>Simon was under the sail．The sail and the sheet were all around him，and for several seconds he could see nothing．Then he came up，into the air．He saw a foot kicking hard in the water beside him．Someone was moving under the sail．Quickly，he went down under the water again，and tried to help Peter．But Peter caught hold of Simon，and pulled him under water too．There was a quick，frightening fight，and then Simon managed to pull them both up，into the air again ．They held onto the side of the boat together，breathing deeply．</p>
<p>西蒙在帆下面。帆和纸缠住了他，有几秒钟他什么也看不见。然后他摆脱出来，浮到水面。他看见在他身旁有只脚用力在水中踢着。有人在帆下动。他迅速再次钻入水中，试图帮助彼得。但是彼得抓住西蒙，把他也拽入水中。经过一番迅速而可怕的拼搏，西蒙设法使两人都又重新露出水面，他们一起抓住船帮，深深地吸气。</p>
<p>Simon saw Susan holding onto the back of the boat．Then he heard someone shouting．He looked behind him and saw the man from the factory．He was shouting and pointing down-stream．But Simon had water in his ears，and at first he couldn't hear the words very well．Then he understood．</p>
<p>西蒙看到苏珊抓住船尾。然后听到有人呼喊。他往身后看，看见那个从工厂来的人。那人一边喊，一边指向下游。但是西蒙耳朵里有水，一开始他听不太清楚。随后他明白了。</p>
<p>'Look！'the man said．'The girl！She's drowning！'</p>
<p>“看啊！”那人说。“那女孩！她要淹死了！”</p>
<p>Simon looked downstream，where the man was pointing．He saw something white，floating，far away．It was not doing anything，just floating round and round，like a bag of old clothes on the water．Christine！The river was taking her quickly downstream，towards the sea．</p>
<p>西蒙顺着那人所指的方向往下游望去。他看见远处有一个白色物体漂浮着。它一动不动，只是漂呀漂，像一袋旧衣服在水上漂。克里斯汀！河水正把她迅速地带向下游，通往大海。</p>
<p>Hurriedly，Simon began to swim after her．He was a good swimmer，but the white clothes slowed him down．He swam as fast as he could，but he seemed to go slowly，so slowly．The water seemed heavy，and held him back．For the rest of his life he would dream about that long，slow swim，towards a white body that floated quickly away in front of him．</p>
<p>西蒙马上跟着她游去。他是一个游泳健将，但是白衣服减慢了他的速度。他尽力游快，但他好像很慢，太慢了。河水好像很凶猛并且阻挡他前进。这辈子他都会常梦见这一漫长的游泳，他紧随眼前迅速漂走的白色躯体。</p>
<p>At last he reached Christine．She was floating with her face down，unconscious．He tried to turn her over，but it was so difficult．She was heavy，and her arms fell back in the water when he dropped them．He got her face out of the water but her head fell backwards，lifeless，and she was not breathing．He caught hold of her face then，put his mouth over hers，and blew into it．He rested，and then blew into her mouth again，and again．Nothing happened．</p>
<p>终于他追上了克里斯停她脸朝下漂浮着，已失去知觉。他设法把她翻过身来，但很困难。她很沉，而且当他一松手她的两臂又落入水中。他把她的脸托出水面，但她的头向后垂，没有生命，没有呼吸。他托住她的脸，把他的嘴贴在她嘴上，往里吹气。他歇一下，又往她嘴里吹，一次又一次，没有变化。</p>
<p>He looked around him．They were in the middle of the river，moving quickly downstream．Here，it was about twenty-five metres to the bank，but about two hundred metres downstream a second river came in from the left．The bank was further away there，and the water moved faster．Simon was tired，and afraid．It had rained last night，and there was a lot of water moving downstream to the sea．The strong wind blew little waves into his face．</p>
<p>他环视一下四围。他们在河中心，正迅速冲向下游。这里离岸边约二十五米，但大约两百米的下游从左边又有另一条河汇入。那儿的岸边更远，水流更急。西蒙又累又怕。昨夜下过雨，有大量雨水流向下游进入大海。强风在他脸上溅起小浪花。</p>
<p>He began to swim on his back，pulling Christine towards the trees on the bank．He swam for half a minute，then stopped，and blew four times into her mouth．Once，he thought he saw her breathe，but he couldn't be sure．Her face was very white，and he had no idea if her heart was beating．The river was taking them quickly to the sea．</p>
<p>他开始仰游，拖着克里斯汀向岸边的树游去。他游半分钟，停一下，向她嘴里吹4次气。有一次，他以为他看见她呼吸了，但他不敢肯定。她的脸色苍白，他不知道她的心脏是否还跳动，河水带着他们迅速流向大海。</p>
<p>He swam harder，kicking strongly with his legs．Nearer—only five metres to go now．But the bank was moving past very quickly．There was a tree near the bank．Its branches were low over the water．Simon kicked hard，caught the branch，and held onto it．The water tried to pull him away．He took a deep breath，and blew strongly into Christine's mouth again．And this time，he was sure，she took a breath by herself，afterwards．</p>
<p>他奋力地游，双腿用力蹬水。近了——现在只有5米远了。但是河岸飞快地移动。靠近岸边有一棵树。它的枝头低低地伸向水面。西蒙使劲一蹬，抓住树枝，并握住它。河水试图把他拖走。他深深地吸口气，再次用力吹进克里斯汀的嘴里。这一次，他确定，她自己紧接着吸了一口气。</p>
<p>It took him nearly five minutes to pull her on to the bank．When they got there，he put her on the ground，breathed into her mouth again，and then felt for her heart．At first he couldn't find it—his hands were too cold．Then—yes！—it was beating．</p>
<p>他大约花了五分钟把她拖上岸。当他们上岸后，他把她放在地上，再次往她嘴里吹气，然后摸她的心口。一开始他感觉不到，因为他的手太凉了。然后，感觉到了，心在跳动。</p>
<p>For another five minutes he helped her breathe，until he was sure she could do it by herself．Then he began to shiver．The wind made his wet clothes cold on his body．He wondered what to do．Then he looked down，and saw that Christine's eyes were open．</p>
<p>随后的5分钟他帮助她呼吸，直到他确信她能够自己呼吸。接着他开始发抖，风吹得他身上的湿衣服冰凉地贴在身上。他考虑该怎么办。这时他往下看，看到克里斯汀睁开了眼睛。</p>
<p>'Chris，'he said．'Are you all right？'</p>
<p>“克里斯汀，”他说，“你好吗？”</p>
<p>She said something，but very quietly and he could not hear it．He lay down，and put his arms around her，to keep her warm．He could feel her heart beating，and her body breath-ing under him．Simon began to cry．</p>
<p>她说了些什么，但非常轻，他听不到。他躺下身子，双臂搂住她，温暖她。他可以感到她的心在跳，她的身体在他下面喘气，西蒙开始哭了。</p><a href='11.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
