<p><b>4 海豹 </b></p>
<p>A few months later，John invited Mary to a meal in the new house．It was a difficult evening．He had never invited anyone to their old flat，and the children's friends nev-er came for meals．The new house was very untidy，and John was nervous about the food．He and Christine cooked a chick-en because they thought it was easy．But the chicken was tasteless and the rice was too soft．</p>
<p>几个月以后，约翰邀请玛丽到他的新居共进晚餐。这是一个不顺利的夜晚。他从没邀请过任何人到他们的旧寓所，孩子们的朋友也从未来聚过餐。新房子里非常凌乱，约翰对食物感到很担心。他和克里斯汀认为做鸡容易，于是就烧了鸡。但是鸡做得没有味道，米饭也太软了。</p>
<p>Mary smiled，and pretended not to notice．But the evening went badly．Christine was angry with her because she tidied up the kitchen，and Andrew was angry with her because she didn't want to watch TV．Both the children went to bed early，and thought about their mother．</p>
<p>玛丽微笑着，假装没注意到。但是晚上过得很糟糕。克里斯汀生她的气，因为玛丽收拾了厨房，安德鲁生她的气是因为她不愿看电视。两个孩子很早就上床睡觉，并且思念着他们的母亲。</p>
<p>But Mary came again，on a Sunday，and John took them all out in their new boat．That was much better．Mary didn't know how to sail，so the children had to tell her what to do．She did what she was told，and seemed to be happy．John sat at the back of the boat，and watched his children quietly．He felt proud of them， and he thought they were proud of him too．The first time Mary and the children laughed together，John felt a big smile come onto his face．</p>
<p>然而玛丽在一个星期天又来了，约翰带着所有的人乘着他们的新船出游。这次好多了。玛丽不知如何驾船，所以孩子们不得不告诉她如何去做。她按照指令操作，显得很快活。约翰坐在船尾，静静地注视着孩子们。他为他们感到骄傲，他想他们也为他感到骄傲。玛丽和孩子们第一次在一起欢笑，约翰觉得他自己脸上也绽开了笑容。</p>
<p>It was a beautiful，sunny day in the middle of May．There was a good wind，and the sailing was fun．The boat sailed fast，over small，white-topped waves．The sky was blue and clear．They sailed down to the mouth of the river，where there were lots of small islands and sandbanks．</p>
<p>那是5月中旬阳光明媚的一天，微风拂面，乘船游览很有趣。小船在泛泛微波上行驶得很快。天空蔚蓝无云。他们行驶到河口，那里有很多小岛和沙滩。</p>
<p>'Look，Dad，quick！Over there！What are they？'</p>
<p>“快看，爸爸！在那儿！它们是什么？”</p>
<p>Andrew pointed excitedly to one of the long，low sandbanks．</p>
<p>安德鲁兴奋地指着其中一个长长的低沙滩。</p>
<p>'Seals，'said John．'Haven't you seen them before？'</p>
<p>“海豹，”约翰答道。“你以前从没见过海豹吗？”</p>
<p>'No，'said Andrew．'Only in films．Not in real life．'His face was shining，excited，happy．'Do they really live here？'</p>
<p>“没有，”安德鲁说，“只在电影上见过。我没有在现实生活中见过。”他的脸闪着光、兴奋和喜悦。“它们真的住在这里吗？”</p>
<p>'Yes．It's a group of seal families．The mothers come here every year to have their babies．'</p>
<p>“是的。那是一群海豹家族。雌海豹每年到这里来产下它们的幼崽。”</p>
<p>They sailed closer to the sandbank，until they were only about twenty metres away from the seals． Wet，shiny seal mothers lifted their heads and looked at them with their blue eyes．The baby seals were drinking milk from their mothers，climbing over them， and playing in the shallow water． Then a big father seal lifted his head and stared angrily at them．</p>
<p>他们驶近沙滩，一直到离海豹只有约二十米远。湿润光滑的海豹妈妈们抬起它们的头，用它们的蓝眼睛注视着他们。幼海豹正在吸吮它们妈妈的奶，爬过它们妈妈的背，在浅水中戏耍。这时一只大雄性海豹抬起它的头愤怒地盯着他们。</p>
<p>'I think they're beautiful，'said Mary．'I never knew they lived here， so close to the town． It makes me feel really happy，just to see them．'</p>
<p>“我觉得它们很漂亮，”玛丽说，“我从来不知道它们住在这里，离镇这么近，仅仅是望着它们就足以使我感到非常快活了。”</p>
<p>'Yes，it does，doesn't it，'said Christine．'I think nothing can be really wrong with the world， if they can live here，all by themselves，with no one looking after them．'</p>
<p>“真是这样，难道不是吗？”克里斯汀说道。“我想这个世界真美好，它们能够在此生存，完全靠自己，没有任何人照顾它们。”</p>
<p>'Yes，'said Mary．'And they're really beautiful，too．Look！Did you see that little one， playing on his mother's back？ I wish I could do that！'</p>
<p>“是的，”玛丽说，“并且它们也确实很漂亮。看那儿！你看到那个在妈妈背上玩耍的小不点了吗？我希望我也能那样做！”</p>
<p>John smiled，as he watched Mary and his children laughing and talking together．He thought the world was a good place，too．</p>
<p>约翰看着玛丽和他的孩子们在一起欢声笑语，一边微笑着。他也认为这个世界是一个好地方。</p><a href='5.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
