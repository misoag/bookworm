<p><b>8 婚礼 </b></p>
<p>The disease among the seals got worse．Three more baby seals died，and one was born without a tall．Scientists came from London to look at them，and there were long arti-cles in the newspapers，but no one was sure what the reasons were．Some people said that it was a disease that was always in the water；some people said the seals were eating diseased fish；and some people said that it was the paint factory near the river．</p>
<p>海豹的疾病日趋严重。又有3只幼豹死亡，有一只生出来就没有尾巴。从伦敦来的科学家们察看了它们，报纸上也登载了长篇文章，但是没有人能肯定是什么原因。有些人说水中本来就有这种疾玻有些人说海豹是吃了有病的鱼。还有些人说是河附近的油漆厂。</p>
<p>There was a sewage works near the river too．The sewage from another small town came to it．One day，in the factory，John Duncan found two young chemists testing samples of wa-ter from the river．The water came from two kilometres up-stream，near the sewage works．</p>
<p>河附近还有一个污水处理厂。污水来自另一个小镇。一天，在工厂里，约翰&middot;邓肯发现两名年青的化学师在测试从河里提取的水样。水来自两公里以外的上游，靠近污水处理厂。</p>
<p>'Why are you doing that？'he asked，surprised．</p>
<p>“你们为什么做这事？”他惊奇地问。</p>
<p>'It's a special experiment，'one of them answered．'David Wilson asked us to do it himself．Didn't he tell you，sir？'</p>
<p>“这是一项特殊实验。”其中一个答道。“是大卫&middot;威尔逊亲自让我们做的，他没告诉你吗，先生？”</p>
<p>John didn't answer．He watched them quietly for several minutes．'What are the results？'he asked．</p>
<p>约翰没有回答。他静静地望着他们有几分钟。“结果怎样？”他问。</p>
<p>'They're bad，sir，'said the young man．But he didn't look worried；he looked pleased，proud of himself．</p>
<p>“非常糟糕，先生，”年青人说。但他看上去并不担忧。他显得很高兴，很自豪。</p>
<p>'That sewage works is putting a lot of nasty things into the river，you know．I think the newspapers will be very interested．'</p>
<p>“那个污水处理厂正在往河里放一些脏东西，你知道。我想报纸对此会非常感兴趣。”</p>
<p>'The newspapers？'John asked．The young man smiled．</p>
<p>“报纸吗？”约翰问。年青人笑了。</p>
<p>'Yes，Mr Duncan，of course．Our company cares about the environment，doesn't it？That's why we're doing this．We want to help those poor seals，if we can．'</p>
<p>“是的，邓肯先生，当然。我们公司关心环境，是吧？这就是我们为什么要做实验。如果能够的话，我们想帮助那些可怜的海豹。”</p>
<p>As John walked away，he listened for the sound of quiet laughter behind him．But he heard nothing．Perhaps the young man really believed what he said．</p>
<p>当约翰走开时，他等着听背后轻轻的笑声。但是他什么也没听到。也许年青人真的相信他所说的。</p>
<p>Christine and Simon were married on a fine day in June．When they came back from the church，they had a party in the gar-den at John's house．Everyone seemed very happy．John liked Simon's parents，and talked to them a lot．</p>
<p>克里斯汀和西蒙在6月一个明媚的日子里结了婚。当他们从教堂回来后，在约翰家的花园里举行了宴会。每个人好像都很快乐。约翰喜欢西蒙的父母，跟他们聊了很多。</p>
<p>'You're very lucky，Mr Duncan，'simon's father said．'You have a beautiful house with a lovely river at the end of the garden．'</p>
<p>“你很幸运，邓肯先生，”西蒙的父亲说，“你有一座漂亮的房子，花园尽头是可爱的河。”</p>
<p>'I haven't always been lucky，'John answered．'People used to say I was a very unlucky man．'He stood still，think-ing．He remembered how unhappy he had been in the little flat in the middle of the town．He had been unemployed then，with no money to buy good things for his children．But he had always been able to talk to them．Now he was a rich man，a success，and his children didn't want to talk to him．</p>
<p>“我不总是幸运，”约翰回答道。“人们曾经说我是一个很不幸的人。”他站在那儿不动，思考着。他记得他曾多么不幸福，住在小镇中部的一所小公寓里。然后他失业了，没钱给他的孩子们买好东西。但是他总能够跟他们交谈。现在他是一个富人、一个成功者，可他的孩子不愿跟他交谈。</p>
<p>He smiled at Mr and Mrs MacDonald．'Yes，'he said．'I'm a very lucky man．I have Simon for my son-in-law．I'm very pleased for my daughter．'</p>
<p>他冲着麦克唐纳夫妇笑着说：“是的，我是一个非常幸运的人，我有西蒙做我的女婿。我为我女儿感到非常高兴。”</p>
<p>Mrs MacDonald was pleased．'We're very pleased to have Christine for our daughter-in-law，too，'she said．'And I'm sure Simon will help you with this river，Mr Duncan．I under-stand there's a disease in it，which is making the seals ill．Simon told me he's going to work very hard to find the reason for that，and clean up the river．I'm sure you're pleased about that，Mr Duncan．'</p>
<p>麦克唐纳太太很满意。“能有克里斯汀做我们的儿媳，我们也非常高兴，”她说。“我相信西蒙会帮助你解决河的问题，邓肯先生。我知道河里有病菌使海豹得玻西蒙告诉我他将努力去查找原因，清理河流。我相信你会对此满意的，邓肯先生。”</p>
<p>'Yes，of course．'John had seen Simon's article in the newspaper last night，about the diseases that came from the sewage works．David Wilson had shown it to him．John didn't want to talk about it．</p>
<p>“这当然。”约翰昨晚已经看到报纸上西蒙写的关于疾病来自污水处理厂的文章。是大卫&middot;威尔逊拿给他看的。约翰不想说什么。</p>
<p>He saw his daughter laughing with Simon，Andrew and some friends．He had never seen her look so happy．He re-membered his own wedding，and the hopes he and Rachel had had．</p>
<p>他看到他女儿与酉蒙、安德鲁和一些朋友在一起欢笑。他从没看到过她有这么高兴。他想起了自己的婚礼，以及他和雷切尔曾有过的愿望。</p>
<p>'Let me get you another drink，Mrs MacDonald，'he said．'We must drink to our children's future，and wish them luck．'</p>
<p>“我再给你斟一杯，麦克唐纳太太，”他说。“我们要为我们孩子的将来干杯，祝他们好运。”</p>
<p>At the bar in the house he met Mary．She came back to the town sometimes，and twice he had visited her in Scotland．</p>
<p>在屋中的酒吧前他遇见了玛丽。她有时回到镇上，他也曾两次去苏格兰拜访她。</p>
<p>'This day's been a great success，John，'she said．'You must be a happy man．'</p>
<p>“这一天很成功，约翰，”她说。“你一定是个幸福的人。”</p>
<p>He touched her arm thoughtfully．'I'd like to be，Mary，'he said．'I've tried，you know．I've done my best．But it's their world now．They must do what they can with it． '</p>
<p>他深思地摸着她的胳臂。“我很想成为一个幸福的人，玛丽，”他说，“我努力过，你知道，我尽力了。但现在是他们的世界，他们应该为之努力。”</p><a href='9.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
