<p>Where was my spacesuit？</p>
<p>我的太空服哪儿去啦？</p>
<p>Eee-Eee found it up in a tree where another squirrel was living in it．Eee-Eee told the squirrel to get out of my spacesuit．</p>
<p>“噫噫”在一棵树上找到了它，另一只松鼠住在里面。“噫噫”叫那只松鼠从我的太空服里出来。</p>
<p>I was happy to wear the spacesuit．Hoo-Woo took me to the door where I first came in．</p>
<p>穿上太空服我很高兴。“呼呜”把我带到起初我进来的门那儿。</p>
<p>Hoo-Woo made his noise：'Hoo-woo！'as I opened the door．He was sad that I was going．</p>
<p>我开门的时候，呼呜叫了一声：“呼——呜！”。我要走了，它有些难过。</p>
<p>I said，'I'm coming back，'and I went out to my spaceship．</p>
<p>我说：“我会回来的。”然后就出去回到了我的飞船上。</p>
<p>I got in and said，'Take me home．'</p>
<p>我进了飞船，说道：“带我回家。”</p>
<p>The stars changed suddenly．I saw my world in space，all green and beautiful．A few minutes later the spaceship landed and I was home．</p>
<p>星星突然变了。我看见我的星球在太空中，全是绿色，很美。几分钟后飞船着陆，我回到了家。</p>
<p>My father ran from the house shouting，'Hummy！'</p>
<p>爸爸从房子里跑出来，喊道：“蜂儿！”</p>
<p>I kissed my father．</p>
<p>我亲了爸爸。</p>
<p>My mother was angry with me．'I didn't know if you were dead or alive！'she cried．'It's been a week！'</p>
<p>妈妈在生我的气。“我不知道你是死是活！”她大声说，“整整一个星期！”</p>
<p>A week！It felt like months to me．</p>
<p>一个星期！我觉得象是好几个月了。</p>
<p>'I've got some very exciting news for you，'I said．</p>
<p>“我给你们带来一个非常令人激动的消息，”我说。</p>
<p>'OK，'my mother said．'Let's sit in the theat and talk there．Oh yes，'she said to my father，'why don't you go to the house and bring us something to drink？'</p>
<p>“好，”妈妈说，“我们到麦田里坐下谈谈。哦，对了，”她对爸爸说，“你能不能到房子里给我们拿点喝的？”</p>
<p>Strange．Robots usually bring the drinks．But I just thought my mother wanted to be specially nice to me．</p>
<p>奇怪，一般是机器人拿饮料的。但我只以为妈妈是想对我特别地好些。</p>
<p>I told my mother what had happened．When my father came with drinks，I told my story anain．</p>
<p>我把所发生的事情跟妈妈说了。爸爸把饮料拿来后，我又把事情说了一遍。</p>
<p>Telling my story，I looked at the green fields of wheat moving in the wind．The wheat went on for thousands of miles，looking just the same everywhere．</p>
<p>我一边讲着我的经历，一边看着绿油油的麦田在风中摇曳。麦田绵延数千英里，哪儿看上去都一个样。</p>
<p>How different it was in the Star Zoo！Every time you turned your head， you saw something new．That had frightened me at first but now I thought the Star Zoo was wonderful．</p>
<p>星际动物园里就截然不同！每当你转过头，就能看到新的东西。一开始，还把我吓了一跳，可现在我觉得星际动物园真棒。</p>
<p>I explained that feeling to my parents．</p>
<p>我把我的感觉向父母说了。</p>
<p>'Yes，yes，Hummy，'my mother said，looking quickly at my father．</p>
<p>“好了，好了，蜂儿，”妈妈说，并很快地瞥了爸爸一眼。</p>
<p>I saw a spaceship land near the house．'Who's coming？'I asked．</p>
<p>我看到有一只飞船降落在房子旁边。“谁来了？”我问道。</p>
<p>My mother and father looked at each other．Then I knew．</p>
<p>妈妈和爸爸对视了一眼。我马上就明白了。</p>
<p>'It's Buff，isn't it？'I said．'You called him when you were getting the drinks！'I said to my father．I was really angry．'How could you？Wait！You don't believe me，do you？'</p>
<p>“是牛子，对不对？”我说，“你拿饮料的时候给他打电话了！”我对爸爸说。我真的生气了。“你怎么能这样？等一等！你们不相信我，是吗？”</p>
<p>'Your head is full of dreams， Hummy，'my father said．'You must be married to Buff，but only for a year．Then you can get married to someone you like．'</p>
<p>“你的脑子里充满梦想，蜂儿。”爸爸说，“你得嫁给牛子，不过是一年的事。然后你可以嫁给一个你喜欢的人。”</p>
<p>I jumped up．'I hate you！Why did I come back？Why didn't I go straight to the Star Council？'</p>
<p>我跳了起来。“我恨你们！我为什么要回来？我为什么不直接去星际理事会？”</p>
<p>Buff walked up to us．'Hello again，Kate，'he said．'I still remember the first name you told me．'</p>
<p>牛子朝我们走来。“又见面了，虫子。”他说，“我还记得你第一次告诉我的名字。”</p>
<p>I had an idea．'Listen to what happened to me，'I said，and Itold my story a third time．</p>
<p>我想出了个主意。“你听听我都经历了些什么。”我说。接着，我又把事情讲了一遍。</p>
<p>Buff laughed．' What a story！You can tell me stories like that every night．'</p>
<p>牛子笑了。“好一个故事！你每天晚上都可以给我讲这样的故事。”</p>
<p>'So you don't believe me？'I smiled．</p>
<p>“这么说你不相信我？”我笑道。</p>
<p>He just laughed．</p>
<p>他只是笑。</p>
<p>'OK，Buff，'I said．'Come with me．I'll show you the Star Zoo．If it's only a story， I'll marry you． I'll even get married for five years if you want．OK？'</p>
<p>“好，牛子，”我说，“跟我来。我带你去看星际动物园。如果是假的，我就嫁给你。如果你愿意，我可以嫁给你五年。行吗？”</p>
<p>'Why not？'Buff said．'I'll bring a robot to see what's really there．Robots never lie．'</p>
<p>“有什么不好？”牛子说，“我要带一个机器人去看看到底是怎么回事儿。机器人从不撒谎。”</p>
<p>Buff borrowed one of our family robots and we took off．My father watched us go with a worried face．</p>
<p>牛子带上我家的一个机器人，我们就起飞了。我爸爸面露愁容地看着我们走了。</p>
<p>It was black in the empty space far between stars and we couldn't see anything．Buff was surprised when we landed onthe Star Zoo．</p>
<p>星星之间的茫茫太空一片漆黑，我们什么也看不见。我们星际动物园着陆时牛子很吃惊。</p>
<p>We put on spacesuits and went out．Buff looked at the door，very surprised． We went in．</p>
<p>我们穿上太空服到了外面。牛子看着那扇门，惊讶万分。我们走了进去。</p>
<p>After we went through the second door，Buff stood without moving and he looked at the trees and didn't say anything． The robot closed the door behind us．</p>
<p>我们穿过第二道门，牛子一动不动地站住了，他看着那些树，没有说话。机器人在后面把门关上。</p>
<p>Hoo－Woo ran out of the trees to meet me． I was happy to see him and happy to be back in the Star Zoo again． I wasn't afraid at all．</p>
<p>“呼呜”从树林里跑出来迎接我。我很高兴看到它，也很高兴又回到星际动物园。我一点都不怕。</p>
<p>I looked round at Buff and my heart stopped．Buff's face was full of hate and he was holding a laser gun．The gun was pointing at Hoo－Woo．</p>
<p>我回头去看牛子，我的心差点儿停止了跳动。牛子满脸憎恶，他手里拿着一支激光枪。枪是对准“呼鸣”的。</p><a href='7.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
