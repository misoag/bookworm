<p><b>3 怪物 </b></p>
<p>There was a door at the other end of the tunnel．I went through and…</p>
<p>隧道的尽头有一个门。我进去了……</p>
<p>I was dreaming！I saw big things that grew out of the ground．They were much taller than me with long brown arms covered with green leaves．</p>
<p>我在做梦吧！我看见地上长出的很大的东西。它们比我高许多，长着长长的棕色臂膀，上面有绿色的叶子盖着。</p>
<p>I was very frightened as I remembered something in the Book of Remembering：'In those days there were trees…'</p>
<p>我怕极了，我想起《往事追忆》中说的：“那时候有树……”</p>
<p>Trees！</p>
<p>树！</p>
<p>I never thought a living thing could be so big．I covered my eyes with my hands．I was afraid to look…but I was afraid not to look．</p>
<p>我从没想过生物会长得这么大。我用手捂住眼睛。我不敢看……可不看我也害怕。</p>
<p>After a time I took my hands away from my eyes．The trees were still there．They weren't moving．</p>
<p>过了一会儿，我把手从眼前拿开。树还在那儿，它们一动不动。</p>
<p>I suddenly understood that the trees couldn't move．They were plants，like potatoes or rice．I was safe standing under them．</p>
<p>我马上明白了，树不会动。它们是植物，象土豆和水稻一样。我站在树下是安全的。</p>
<p>But I didn't feel safe．</p>
<p>可我感到并不安全。</p>
<p>The computer inside my spacesuit was checking the air for me．After a few seconds the red lights on my suit turned to green．The air here was safe for humans．So I took off my spacesuit．</p>
<p>我太空服里的电脑正在替我检查空气状况。几秒钟后，我太空服里的红灯变成了绿灯。这儿的空气对人类是安全的。于是我脱下了太空服。</p>
<p>Now I could touch and smell things．There was a soft wind．It was cool．I smelt…strange new smells．I smelt living things．Was I smelling the trees…or something else？</p>
<p>这样我就可以触摸和闻东西了。微风袭来，有些凉意。我闻到了什么气味，一种怪怪的、从没闻到过的气味。是生物的气味。我闻到的是树么，还是其他什么东西？</p>
<p>I heard a sound of crying．Then I thought I heard something moving in the trees—just behind one big tree．</p>
<p>我听到一阵叫声。然后我想我听见树后有东西在动——就在一棵大树后面。</p>
<p>Was something hiding behind the tree？I was frightened but I wanted to see，so I walked slowly towards the tree．</p>
<p>有东西藏在树后面么？我很害怕，可我又想看看，于是我慢慢地朝树走了过去。</p>
<p>There was light in this place but there were shadows in the trees．I looked round the tree…</p>
<p>这地方有光亮，但树丛里却有些黑影。我绕过树一看……</p>
<p>I was frightened almost out of my mind．I fell down and my body started shaking．</p>
<p>我几乎吓晕过去。我倒在地上，身体颤抖起来。</p>
<p>A grey thing came out from behind the tree and came towards me． It was big but it wasn't tall because it walked on four feet．It had no hands．</p>
<p>一个灰色的东西从树后闪出来，朝我而来。它很大，但不高，因为它是四条腿走路的。它没有手。</p>
<p>But the thing had teeth．Yes，it had a mouth full of teeth，yellow， shiny teeth． It had yellow eyes and grey hair all over its body．I could smell it…</p>
<p>那东西长着牙齿。对，长着满口黄色、闪亮的牙齿。它还长着黄色的眼睛，浑身上下都是灰色的毛。我能闻到它的气味。</p>
<p>Its mouth came towards my face．I closed my eyes and waited to die．</p>
<p>它的嘴巴凑到我脸上。我闭上眼睛，等死。</p>
<p>There was hot air on my face．I wanted to scream and scream but I was too frightened．I couldn't scream．</p>
<p>我感觉到脸上有热乎乎的气息。我想放声大叫，可我被吓呆了。我叫不出声来。</p>
<p>My mind exploded．I went crazy．I suddenly hit the grey thing and it fell back against the tree．I hit it again，as hard as I could．</p>
<p>我脑子吓懵了，变得狂乱。我猛击那个灰不溜秋的东西，它退后撞到树上。我又打了一下，使出了全身的力气。</p>
<p>I wanted to destroy the grey thing and I was screaming．Suddenly it was gone．</p>
<p>我想打死那个灰色家伙，我尖叫着。突然，它不见了。</p>
<p>Then I saw another monster．This one was very small with grey fur all over its body． It was holding on to the tree but I pulled it off．I could destroy this one！</p>
<p>然后我又看到另外一只怪物。这东西很小，全身都是灰色的皮毛。它伏在树上。我把它拉了下来。这一个我能消灭！</p>
<p>I pulled its short legs hard．The small monster bit me．Its teeth went right into my finger．The pain was terrible．</p>
<p>我使劲儿拽着它的短腿。这小怪物咬了我一口。它的牙齿咬进了我的手指。疼死了。</p>
<p>But my mind was exploding．I wanted to destroy it and I didn't care about the pain．I just wanted to kill it．</p>
<p>但我疯狂了。我一心想除掉它，顾不上疼痛。我就是想弄死它。</p>
<p>Then the big grey monster ran back through the trees，jumped at me and knocked me down．As I fell，I dropped the little monster and it escaped．</p>
<p>接着，那只大怪物从树丛里跑出来，扑向我，把我打倒了。这一摔，我放走了那小怪物，让它逃开了。</p>
<p>My head banged on a rock and everything went black．</p>
<p>我的头撞在了一块石头上，眼前的一切都变黑了。</p><a href='4.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
