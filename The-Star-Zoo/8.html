<p><b>8 造出了一只动物 </b></p>
<p>Arobot can do many different things from taking care of a baby to building a spaceship．It can do anything except think．The Star Zoo computer was the only one that could think．</p>
<p>从照看婴儿到制造飞船，机器人能做许许多多不同的工作。除了思维，它无所不能。星际动物园的电脑是唯一能思维的。</p>
<p>Well， our family robot could build a robot animal， easily． That was no problem．</p>
<p>没问题，我的家用机器人可以造一个机器动物，轻而易举。没有问题。</p>
<p>First we had to choose what animal to make， so we went round the Star Zoo to look at all．the animals．Hee-Haw carried me and Hoo-Woo came with us．The robot followed．</p>
<p>我们先得选择制造什么动物，于是我们在星际动物园走了一圈，把所有动物都看一看。“嘻嗬”驮着我，“呼呜”陪着我们。机器人跟在后面。</p>
<p>I don't know how many rooms the Star Zoo had； I couldn't count them all．Some rooms were filled with water where there were big fish and small fish．There were horrible monsters walking under the water and I felt a little afraid again．</p>
<p>我弄不清星际动物园有多少房间，我无法全数过来。有的房间装着水，里面养着大鱼和小鱼。水下面还有可怕的怪物在行走，让我又觉得有点害怕。</p>
<p>Some rooms were covered in snow and all the animals there had while fur．There were dry rooms， hot wet rooms， forest rooms…And animals and birds and trees and flowers！</p>
<p>有的房间被雪覆盖，所有的动物长着白色的皮毛。有干燥的房间、湿热的房间、森林房间……以及动物、鸟、树，还有花！</p>
<p>There were more living things than I had ever dreamt of！</p>
<p>这儿的动物比我所想象的多得多！</p>
<p>I sat on Hee-Haw's back as the donkey walked on．We went through a door into a room full of strange life， then we went through another door and into another room，It was like a dream．In a dream， things change suddenly，without reason．It was like that．</p>
<p>我坐在“嘻嗬”的背上，驴子继续往前走。我们穿过一扇门，进入一个满是千奇百怪的生命的房间。然后，我们穿过另一扇门进入另一个房间。象在做梦一样。在梦中，事物变幻莫测，讲不清道理。就象是那样。</p>
<p>We went back to the computer．I didn't know which animal to choose and neither did the robot．Hee-Haw and Hoo-Woo didn't understand the problem；they weren't intelligent in the human way．</p>
<p>我们回到电脑那儿。我还是不知道该选择哪种动物，机器人也不知道。“嘻嗬”和“呼呜”不明白是怎么回事；它们没有人类这样的智慧。</p>
<p>So I asked the computer．</p>
<p>于是我问电脑。</p>
<p>'Watch humans，'the computer said．'Humans enjoy playing with animals．Find an animal which enjoys playing with humans．'</p>
<p>“看看人类。”电脑说，“人类喜欢和动物玩，找一只喜欢陪人类玩的动物。”</p>
<p>So we went to see the humans．</p>
<p>于是我们去看人类。</p>
<p>The humans in the Star Zoo couldn't speak． I sat down and watched them while the humans played up in the trees，swam in the pool and played games in the grass．They played all the time．</p>
<p>星际动物园的人不会说话。我坐在地上观察他们，他们在树上玩耍，在池子里游泳，在草地上玩游戏。他们总是在玩乐。</p>
<p>Most other animals didn't play with the humans．But finally I saw one animal come through the grass to play． It liked playing with humans！</p>
<p>多数其他的动物都不和人玩。但最后我看见有只动物从草地里跑出来玩。它喜欢和人玩！</p>
<p>The humans played with the animal for an hour．The animal and the humans enjoyed playing together．</p>
<p>那些人和这只动物玩了一个小时。这只动物喜欢和那些人在一起玩。</p>
<p>'That's the animal you must make，'I told the robot．</p>
<p>“你得制造一个那样的动物。”我吩咐机器人。</p>
<p>The robot watched the animal and touched it and measured everything．In the end it was ready to build a robot just like that animal．</p>
<p>机器人观察这只动物，抚摸它，上下都做了测量。最后，它准备好了，可以制造一个跟这只动物一样的机器动物。</p>
<p>'What do you need to build it？'I asked．</p>
<p>“你需要用什么制造它？”我问。</p>
<p>'Plastic，'the robot answered．'I will use real fur on the outside．But I need some metal．Where can I find metal？'</p>
<p>“塑料，”机器人回答，“外面我打算用真皮毛。可我需要些金属。我能在哪儿找点金属？”</p>
<p>There was only one thing in the Star Zoo made of metal－the computer！</p>
<p>星际动物园里只有一样东西是用金属做的——电脑！</p>
<p>The computer told the robot to take off two small pieces of metal from its back．</p>
<p>电脑让机器人从它的后背上取下两小块金属。</p>
<p>The robot worked fast．Sometimes it needed a special tool．Then it opened its stomach because the tools were kept inside the body there．</p>
<p>机器人干活儿很快。有时它需要一些专门的工具。于是它就打开自己的肚皮，因为工具是放在身体里边的。</p>
<p>First，the robot made a plastic body which it covered with soft plastic，like a skin．Then it used fur to cover the skin．</p>
<p>首先，机器人做了一个塑料躯干，外面包上类似皮肤的软塑料。然后它又用皮毛盖住皮肤。</p>
<p>I left before the robot finished because I was worried about Buff．I didn't want him to die．</p>
<p>机器人还没有完工我就离开了，因为我担心牛子。我不希望他死。</p>
<p>Buff still wouldn't eat or drink But the worst thing was， he was still crazy．His mind wasn't getting better…</p>
<p>牛子还是不肯吃喝。但最糟糕的是他还在发狂。他的头脑还是没有好转……</p>
<p>If Buff stays in the Star Zoo，I thought，he'll die．</p>
<p>我想，要是牛子呆在星际动物园，他会死的。</p>
<p>I talked to him but he didn't answer．I knew he wanted to kill me．He wanted to kill all living things．</p>
<p>我跟他说话，可他不回答。我知道他想杀死我。他想把所有活的东西都杀死。</p>
<p>The robot finished its work and showed me a little animal．It looked，and sounded，and played like the real animal． I took it to the computer．</p>
<p>机器人完成了工作，把一只小动物给我看。它的样子、声音和玩相都很象真动物。我把它带到电脑那儿。</p>
<p>'Yes，it looks just like the animal，'the computer said．'It's very small-a baby animal．'the computer told me its name． It checked the animal，then said to the robot，'Make it warm．'</p>
<p>“好，它和真动物一模一样。”电脑说，“它非常小——是只小动物。”电脑告诉了我它的名字。它检查了这只动物，然后对机器人说：“给它体温。”</p>
<p>The little animal was cold．</p>
<p>这只小动物是冷的。</p>
<p>So the robot made the baby animal warm， like the real animal．We were ready．</p>
<p>所以机器人就让它身体象真动物一样温暖。我们准备好了。</p>
<p>The robot put Buff to sleep，then put the spacesuit on him and carried him to the spaceship．</p>
<p>机器人让牛子入睡，然后替他穿上太空服，并把他背到飞船上。</p>
<p>I was leaving the Star Zoo for the second time．Would our plan succeed， I wondered？ Before I went through the door，I looked back at all the life that existed only here in the Star Zoo，and in no other place in all the Galaxy！</p>
<p>我又要离开星际动物园了。我在想，我们的计划能成功吗？出门之前，我回头看了一眼——只有星际动物园才存在生命，银河系其他地方都没有！</p><a href='9.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
