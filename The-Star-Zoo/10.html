<p><b>10 做什么都是一对 </b></p>
<p>It was a strange prison with no doors and no police to watch me．Well，I didn't know the special number for making the lifts work， so I couldn't escape by the lifts．There were stairs but it was ten kilometres straight up to get to the surface．</p>
<p>这是个奇怪的牢房，没有门，也没有警察看管我。哎，我不知道能让电梯运行的密码，所以我不能从电梯逃跑。有楼梯，但要径直往上走十公里才能到地面。</p>
<p>I couldn't get out．</p>
<p>我逃不出去。</p>
<p>I found food and water．Nobody came to see me for three days．</p>
<p>我找到了食物和水。有三天没人来看我了。</p>
<p>Finally a soldier arrived and took me back to the Star Room．An old man with a very straight back sat at the Star Table．He was alone and looked tired．'Hummingbird，'he said and then stopped．</p>
<p>最后，来了个士兵把我带回星际室。一位腰板挺直的老者坐在星际会议桌旁。只有他一个人，显出疲惫的样子。“蜂鸟。”他说，然后就停住了。</p>
<p>'Who are you，please？'I asked．I hadn't seen him before．</p>
<p>“请问您是谁？”我问。我以前没见过他。</p>
<p>'I'm the new President，'he said，but he didn't sound happy about it ．</p>
<p>“我是新主席，”他说。可听上去他并不为此感到高兴。</p>
<p>'So the President and the Councillors are still…'</p>
<p>“这么说原来的主席和理事们还……”</p>
<p>'Still crazy- yes，'the old man said．'I think many of them will get better．They saw the animal only for a very short time．'</p>
<p>“还在发疯——对，”老者说，“我想很多人会好起来的。他们看见那只动物只是一瞬间的事。”</p>
<p>'It wasn't a real animal，'I said quickly．</p>
<p>“它不是真动物，”我连忙说。</p>
<p>'That didn't make any difference．You asked me who I am．I'm just one of the Star Councillors，but I wasn't in the Star Room when you showed them the animal． I was lucky． Now listen，Hummingbird．There is something I must tell you．Something difficult．'</p>
<p>“那没有什么不同。你问我是谁。我只是一个星际理事，但你给他们看那只动物时我不在星际室。我很幸运。现在听着，蜂鸟。我得跟你说些事。一些棘手的问题。”</p>
<p>'Is it about my family？'I asked，feeling afraid．</p>
<p>“是我家的事吗？”我问，觉得有些害怕。</p>
<p>'No，Hummingbird．You are the only person in the Galaxy who knows where the Star Zoo is．If other people know about the Star Zoo， there will be killing． People will be killed．The Star Zoo will be destroyed．It is very important to keep the Star Zoo alive and so it is necessary to keep it secret．I 'm sorry，Hummingbird．You must stay here，ten kilometres down，all your life． I know you're a young girl and I'm sorry．'</p>
<p>“不，蜂鸟。银河系中只有你知道星际动物园在哪儿。如果其他人知道了星际动物园的事，就会发生杀戮。人会被杀死，星际动物园会遭到毁灭。让星际动物园存活下去十分重要，所以需要保密。对不起，蜂鸟。你得呆在这儿，地下十公里，一辈子都呆在这儿。我知道你还是个小姑娘，对不起。”</p>
<p>'All my life？'I said．I couldn't believe it．</p>
<p>“一辈子？”我说道。我简直无法相信这一切。</p>
<p>'Yes，'the old man said．'This is the planet of the Star Council so there is always work here you can do．I'm sorry．'</p>
<p>“是的。”那老者说，“这是星际理事会所在的行星，这儿总有你能做的事。对不起。”</p>
<p>'What kind of work？'I asked．</p>
<p>“什么工作？”我问。</p>
<p>'Well， everything is going crazy now．For example， we have some little children down here that nobody is taking care of．A robot is doing the job now—but little children need real humans．Would you like to try taking care of them？'</p>
<p>“呃，现在什么都乱了。比如，我们下面有些小孩子没人照看。现在是个机器人在照看他们——但小孩子需要真人。你愿意尽力照顾他们吗？”</p>
<p>'OK，'I said．It was something to do．</p>
<p>“行！”我说。也算有事可做。</p>
<p>I went to see the children， who were playing quietly with a robot． I laughed，because the robot was our family robot． I thought this robot and I would do something wonderful．But we could only take care of little children！</p>
<p>我去看望了孩子，他们正安静地和一个机器人玩。我笑了，因为那个机器人正是我们家的机器人。我想，这个机器人和我可以做一些奇异的事情。可我们只能照看小孩子！</p>
<p>I sat on the floor and played with the children．They were all less than four years old．</p>
<p>我坐在地板上陪孩子们玩儿。他们都不到四岁。</p>
<p>They needed somebody．A few of the children were crying．They needed loving．Robots can sing and play games，but they can't love．</p>
<p>他们需要人。有几个孩子在哭。他们需要爱。机器人会唱歌，会玩游戏，可它们不会去爱。</p>
<p>Only the Star Zoo computer can love．</p>
<p>只有星际动物园的那台电脑会给予爱。</p>
<p>Soon one little boy was sitting on my stomach and another boy was running round and round me．A little girl was pulling my hair and another girl was biting my finger．There was a lot of noise．</p>
<p>没过多久，一个小男孩就坐在了我的肚子上，另一个男孩围着我跑。一个小女孩在拽我的头发，另一个女孩咬我的手指。一片吵闹声。</p>
<p>These children were more trouble than any animal in the Star Zoo！</p>
<p>这些孩子比星际动物园的任何动物都要麻烦！</p>
<p>'These girls and boys aren't going to be afraid of animals，'I said to the robot．'I can show them a robot animal and they won't go crazy． I just wish I had one．'</p>
<p>“这些女孩、男孩不会怕动物的。”我对机器人说，“我可以给他们看机器动物，他们不会发疯的。我多希望我有一只机器动物埃”</p>
<p>'You have，'the robot answered．'Shall I take out the other one？'</p>
<p>“你有。”机器人回答，“要我把另一只拿出来吗？”</p>
<p>'What！'I shouted．The little boy fell off my stomach and began screaming． I picked him up and kissed him until the screaming changed to crying．I said，'Another robot animal？'</p>
<p>“什么！”我叫道。那个小男孩从我肚子上掉了下来，开始尖叫起来。我把他抱起来，亲他，直到他的尖叫变成哭泣。我说：“还有一只机器动物？”</p>
<p>'Yes，'the robot said，touching its stomach．</p>
<p>“是的。”机器人说着，摸了摸它的肚子。</p>
<p>Of course the robot had another！Robots always make two of everything．You don't have to tell them．They do it automatically．</p>
<p>当然啦，机器人会有另一只机器动物！机器人做任何东西都做一对。不用你告诉它们。它们会自动去做。</p>
<p>The robot opened its stomach and the second robot animal jumped out． It was just like the first one．</p>
<p>机器人打开肚子，另一只机器动物跳了出来。它跟第一只一模一样。</p>
<p>The little boy stopped crying．He looked at the robot animal with big，round eyes．All the other children were looking，too．</p>
<p>那个小男孩不哭了。他瞪大圆圆的眼睛盯着机器动物。所有其他孩子也都在看着。</p>
<p>The animal began to play． It tried to bite its tail and fell over its own feet． It was a funny， sweet animal． After one minute the children were round it in a circle，laughing and playing with it，just like the humans in the Star Zoo．</p>
<p>动物开始玩耍。它想咬自己的尾巴，却摔倒了。它是只好玩、可爱的动物。很快，孩子们就把它围成了一圈，欢笑着和它玩耍，就像星际动物园的人一样。</p>
<p>I watched them．This was very important．These children hadn't learnt to be afraid of animals because they had never heard of Earth，the Burning，or the Book of Remembering．</p>
<p>我看着他们。这很有意义。这些孩子们还没有学会害怕动物，因为他们还没有听说过地球、大火灾和《往事追忆》。</p>
<p>I watched and thought． I spoke softly to my robot：'If these children go on playing with this robot animal， they will never become afraid of animals． They won't go crazy．'I thought some more， and said，'But if their parents see the animal， the parents will go crazy．'</p>
<p>我看着，想着，轻轻地对我的机器人说：“如果这些孩子就这么和这只机器动物玩下去，他们绝不会害怕动物。他们不会发疯。”我又想了一会儿，说道：“可要是他们的父母看见动物，父母们会发疯的。”</p>
<p>I thought carefully． Yes， there must be a special room in every house．A room which parents couldn't go in．A room for children only． Then children could play with robot animals in that room．</p>
<p>我认真地想了想，对了，每家都要有一间专门的房间，一个父母不能进去的房间。一个只给孩子用的房间。这样孩子们就可以和机器动物在房间里玩了。</p>
<p>'That's it！'I said．'The children will still be happy to be with animals when they are parents．It might take twenty，thirty，forty years，but then—'</p>
<p>“就这样！”我说，“当这些孩子做了父母，他们还会喜欢动物的。这可能要二十、三十、四十年，但以后——”</p>
<p>I heard the sound of somebody coming．I shouted to the robot，' Hide that animal， quick！'</p>
<p>我听见有人进来的声音。我向机器人喊道：“把动物藏起来，快！”</p>
<p>The robot opened its stomach and the animal went inside．</p>
<p>机器人打开肚子，动物跑了进去。</p>
<p>All the children began crying．They wanted to have their wonderful animal back again！</p>
<p>所有的孩子开始哭闹。他们希望那只好玩的动物再回来！</p>
<p>It was the President．He looked round at all the crying children．'Did I do this？'he asked．</p>
<p>来的是主席。他朝四周哭闹的孩子们看了看。“是我把他们弄哭了？”他问道。</p>
<p>'No，'I answered．'Please stay．I have fantastic news for you．Listen to what just happened．'</p>
<p>“不是。”我回答，“请呆会儿。我要告诉您一件奇妙的事。您听听刚才都发生了什么。”</p>
<p>The old man listened．First he was angry， then he was surprised but in the end he became very excited．</p>
<p>老人听着。开始他有些生气，后来有些惊奇，但最后他变得非常激动。</p>
<p>'Hummingbird，'the President said，'I must not see that robot animal． I don't want to go crazy．Your idea is…interesting．I think it will work．We must be very careful．We can begin with just one family and can learn from our mistakes． I think we can let you go free，Hummingbid．'</p>
<p>“蜂鸟，”主席说，“我决不看那只机器动物。我不想发疯。你的想法……有意思。我觉得能行。我们得特别小心。我们可以从一家开始，然后吸取教训。我想我们可以放你了，蜂鸟。”</p>
<p>'You can see the animal again soon，'I promised the children，and kissed the ones that were still crying．</p>
<p>“你们很快又能见到那只动物了。”我答应孩子们，亲了亲还在哭的几个。</p>
<p>'So the little children really liked this animal！'the President said．'What kind of animal was it？Does the Book of Remembering talk about it？'</p>
<p>“这么说小孩子们真喜欢这只动物喽！”主席说，“是种什么动物？《往事追忆》里提到了吗？”</p>
<p>'The Book of Remembering talks about cats，'I answered．'This is a baby cat． I can't remember what the computer called it．Oh yes I do-it's called a kitten．'</p>
<p>“《往事追忆》里提到猫，”我回答，“这是只小猫。我记不住电脑是怎么叫它的了。噢，我想起来了——它叫猫咪。”</p></body></html>
