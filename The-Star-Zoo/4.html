<p><b>4 还有怪物 </b></p>
<p>There was a long black nose in front of my face． It was smelling me．</p>
<p>一只长长的黑鼻子探到我面前，正在嗅我。</p>
<p>At first I couldn't understand what was happening．Then I remembered．The monster with teeth！</p>
<p>起初，我不知道发生了什么。接着就想了起来。那个长着牙齿的怪物！</p>
<p>I tried to hit the nose but my arm didn't move．Something was wrong with me．My body felt empty and I was hot inside，like a fire．My body ached and my skin was wet all over．</p>
<p>我想打它的鼻子，可我的胳膊动不了。我哪儿受伤了。我的身体什么也感觉不到，只觉得热，象火一样。我全身酸痛，身上的皮肤都湿了。</p>
<p>The big grey monster sat in front of me and it looked at me．</p>
<p>那只灰色的大怪物坐在我面前，看着我。</p>
<p>Then I saw the small monster too．It was lying on the ground．It was hurt．It was very small，just a little bigger than my hand．It had a beautiful soft tail and it made a sad sound：'Eee-eee！'</p>
<p>接着，我又看到那只小怪物。它躺在地上，受了伤。它非常小，比我的手大不了多少。它长着一条漂亮松软的尾巴，发出一声哀叫：“噫——噫！”</p>
<p>I felt two different things at the same time．I wanted to destroy it…but I also felt sorry for it．It was feeling pain，like me．</p>
<p>我同时有两种截然不同的感觉。我想除掉它，可又挺同情它。它觉得疼，象我一样。</p>
<p>I didn't know what to do so I started to cry．</p>
<p>我不知道该怎么办，于是哭了起来。</p>
<p>The big monster lay down next to me with its fur against my skin．I hated the feeling of its fur but my body couldn't move．</p>
<p>那只大怪物挨着我躺了下来，毛贴着我的皮肤。我讨厌它的皮毛的感觉，但我的身体动不了。</p>
<p>The fur made my skin dry and I began to feel better．I suddenly felt very tired and I was soon asleep．</p>
<p>皮毛弄干了我的皮肤，我开始感觉好些了。我突然觉得筋疲力竭，很快就睡着了。</p>
<p>I woke up feeling better．I wasn't hot inside and I could move again．</p>
<p>我醒来的时候感觉好多了。我身体里面不热了，而且又能动弹了。</p>
<p>The big monster sat down with me．I hit it with my hand but I still wasn't strong．I didn't hurt it．</p>
<p>那只大怪物和我坐在一起。我用手打了它一下，但我还是没劲儿。我伤不着它。</p>
<p>Then the monster opened its mouth and called：'Hoo-woo！'</p>
<p>于是，那怪物张开嘴吼叫道：“呼呜！”</p>
<p>Some time passed．Then more monsters came．More and more．Most of the monsters walked on four legs．A very big one licked me with its tongue．It was a hard tongue，not like my soft tongue．But I felt better afterwards．That monster made a noise like this：'Hee-haw！'</p>
<p>过了一段时间后，又来了些怪物，越来越多。多数怪物都是四条腿走路的。有一只非常大的还用舌头舔我。那舌头很硬，不象我的舌头软软的。但后来我觉得好一些。那只怪物发出一种“嘻——嗬！”的声音。</p>
<p>There was a very small monster that could fly．It had wings and a long hard mouth．It made a noise like this：'Cheepcheep！'</p>
<p>有一只很小的会飞的怪物，它长着翅膀和一只又长又硬的嘴巴。它发出一种“嘁——嘁”的声音。</p>
<p>It cleaned my finger where Eee-Eee had bitten me．CheepCheep's hard little mouth was good at that．</p>
<p>它把“噫噫”咬我手指的地方弄干净了。“嘁嘁”的小硬嘴正好擅长干这个。</p>
<p>I must tell the truth．I wanted to take a laser gun and kill all those monsters． They weren't hurting me．They were helping me．They were nice．</p>
<p>我得说实话。我想拿起一支激光枪把这些怪物都杀掉。它们并不伤害我。它们帮助我。它们挺好的。</p>
<p>But something in my mind hated them．I didn't want to have to think about them．</p>
<p>但我头脑中的不知什么东西讨厌它们。我不愿被迫去想它们。</p>
<p>But I didn't have a laser gun so I couldn't destroy them．</p>
<p>可我没有激光枪，所以不能消灭它们。</p>
<p>One monster brought me water．Another monster gave me some fruit to eat．A few monsters lay against my body and made me warm．They helped me in many ways but there was something sick in my mind．</p>
<p>一只怪物给我弄来了水，另一只怪物给我些果子吃。有几个怪物靠着我的身体躺下，给我保暖。它们用各种办法帮助我，但我的头脑中总有恶心的念头。我还是恨它们。</p>
<p>I still hated them． I will try to explain．For twenty thousand years the Galaxy had belonged to humans．Everything in the Galaxy belonged to us．</p>
<p>我要解释一下。两万年了，银河系都是属于人类的，银河系里的所有东西都属于我们。</p>
<p>When a new baby comes into a family，the first child hates the baby．The first child wants to be the most important， and to keep everything for itself．It is afraid the baby will take things away from it．</p>
<p>当一个家庭新降生了一个婴儿，第一个孩子就会恨这个婴儿。第一个孩子想成为最重要的，想把什么都留给自己。他害怕新婴儿会把什么东西拿走。</p>
<p>It was like that with me．I wanted to fight these monsters．I didn't want them living with me，in my Galaxy．</p>
<p>我就象这样。我想同这些怪物争抢。我不想让它们和我一起，生活在我的银河系里。</p>
<p>One day two humans came through the trees．I stood up．I was stronger now．'Oh，thank Earth-and-animals！'I said and ran towards them．</p>
<p>一天，有两个人从树林里出来。我站了起来。我现在强壮多了。“噢，感谢地球及其动物们！”我说着跑向他们。</p>
<p>The humans looked at me with big round eyes． One human was a man with long hair．He said，'Gug-gug-gug！'</p>
<p>那两个人睁圆了眼睛看着我。一个是头很长发的男人。他说道：“咕——咕——咕！”</p>
<p>Then he went down on the ground on his hands and knees，like a baby．He ran round me，smelling me．</p>
<p>然后他手脚伏在地上，象个孩子似的。他边围着我跑，边嗅我。</p>
<p>The woman said，'Yee-yee-yee！'she jumped up on a branch of a tree．</p>
<p>那个女人说着：“咦——咦——咦！”，跳到了一根树枝上。</p>
<p>They were humans but they were just like the monsters．They couldn't talk to me．</p>
<p>他们虽然是人，却和动物一样。他们不能和我说话。</p>
<p>I started to feel miserable．The monsters tried to give me food but I didn't care about eating．</p>
<p>于是，我觉得十分难过。怪物们想办法给我吃的，可我不想吃。</p>
<p>The monster that said'Hee-haw！'carried me on its back and we went to a little river．Hee－Haw dropped me into the water．I didn't care if I was clean or dirty，but Hee－Haw kicked water over me and washed me．</p>
<p>“嘻——嗬！”叫的那个怪物把我驮在它背上，我们一起走到一条小河边。“嘻嗬”把我扔到水里。我并不在乎自己是干净还是脏，可“嘻嗬”向我身上踢水，为我冲洗。</p>
<p>The big grey monster that said'Hoo-woo！'was worried about me．I didn't eat very much and I didn't wash myself．I just sat．</p>
<p>“呼呜”叫的那只灰色大怪物为我担心。我吃的不多，也不洗漱。我只是傻坐着。</p>
<p>One day Hoo-Woo came with Hee-Haw．Hee-Haw carried me through the trees and the three of us travelled a long way．Finally we came to a high plastic wall．</p>
<p>一天，“呼呜”和“嘻嗬”一起走来。“嘻嗬”驮着我穿过树林，我们三个走了很远。最后我们来到一堵高高的塑料墙面前。</p>
<p>Hoo-Woo pushed open a door in the wall and we went through．On the other side the air was hot and wet and the trees were bigger．There were monsters but they were different．</p>
<p>“呼呜”推开墙上的一扇门，我们走了过去。墙的另一面空气很湿热，树也要大一些。也有怪物，但长的不一样。</p>
<p>Hee-Haw carried me a long way through this forest．In the end we arrived at another plastic wall where there was another door．</p>
<p>“嘻嗬”驮着我在这片森林里走了很远。最后我们来到另一堵塑料墙前，墙上也有一扇门。</p>
<p>Hoo－Woo opened the door and we entered a long tunnel．At the end of the tunnel was another door．At first Hoo-Woo waited outside this door，looking worried．I looked at the door．What was on the other side？Why was Hoo-Woo so worried？In the end he opened the door．</p>
<p>“呼呜”打开门，我们进入了一条长长的隧道。隧道的尽头又有一扇门。开始“呼呜”等在门外，面露愁容。我看着那扇门。墙那边是什么？为什么“呼呜”这么忧心忡忡的？最后他还是打开了门。</p>
<p>I saw a small round room just for a second．Then a terrible bright light came out．After that I couldn't see inside any more；it was too bright．I was very frightened．I felt this fear deep inside me．</p>
<p>我看见一个小圆房间，但只是一瞬间的事。接着，一束耀眼的灯光射出来。后来，里面亮得我都不敢看了。我非常害怕，从心底里感到恐惧。</p>
<p>Hee-Haw's head touched the ground．Hoo－Woo's head touched the ground too．I understood．This was their God！I understood because I felt the same fear as they did．</p>
<p>“嘻嗬”的头伏到地上，“呼呜”的头也伏到了地上。我明白了。这是它们的上帝！我明白了，因为我同它们一样感到恐惧。</p>
<p>Hoo-Woo pushed me towards the light．</p>
<p>“呼呜”把我推向那盏灯。</p><a href='5.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
