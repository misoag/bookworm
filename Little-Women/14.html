<p><b>14 快乐的日子 </b></p>
<p>Christmas Day was very different that year．Beth felt much better and was carried to the window to see the snowman which Jo and Laurie had made．It had a basket of fruit and flowers in one hand and a new piece of music in the other．Laurie ran up and down，bringing in the presents， and Jo sang a funny song．</p>
<p>那年的圣诞节非同寻常。白丝感觉好多了，她被抬到窗前看琼和罗瑞堆起的雪人。它一只手拿着一篮水果和鲜花，另一只手拿着一张新歌谱。罗瑞跑上跑下地送来礼物，琼唱着一首有意思的歌。</p>
<p>'I'm so happy！'laughed Beth，as Jo carried her back to the other room to rest after the fun．'Oh，I do wish that Father was here too！'</p>
<p>“我真高兴！”玩乐过后、琼把白丝抱到另一个房间休息时白丝笑着说。“噢，我真希望爸爸也在这儿！”</p>
<p>Half an hour later，Laurie came to the house and opened the door quietly．'Here's another Christmas present for the March family！'he called out．</p>
<p>半个小时以后，罗瑞来到屋里，静悄悄地打开门。“这儿有给马奇一家的另一份圣诞礼物！”他喊道。</p>
<p>He moved away，and in his place appeared a tall man holding the arm of another tall man，who tried to say something but couldn't．</p>
<p>他挪开了，在他的位子上出现了一个高大的男人，他扶着另一个高大的男人，这个人试图说些什么，但没有说出来。</p>
<p>'Father！'cried Meg and Jo together-and Mr March disappeared under lots of loving arms and kisses．Mr Brooke kissed Meg-by mistake，as he tried to explain．</p>
<p>“爸爸！”麦格和琼同声喊道——然后马奇先生就沉浸在许多爱的拥抱和亲吻中了。布鲁克先生吻了麦格——是个误会，他试图这样解释。</p>
<p>Suddenly， the door to the other room opened， and there was Beth， running straight into her father's arms．There were tears of happiness on many faces before all the excitement died down．Then Mrs March thanked Mr Brooke for taking care ofher husband，and he and Laurie left the family to themselves．</p>
<p>突然，另一个房间的门打开了，是白丝，她径直奔向了父亲的怀抱。兴奋消散之前，许多人脸上都淌下了欢乐的眼泪。马奇太太感谢布鲁克先生照顾了她丈夫，然后他和罗瑞就离开了，剩下了一家人在一起。</p>
<p>Mr March and Beth sat in one big armchair， and the others sat around them．'I wanted to surprise you all，and the doctor let Mr Brooke bring me home，'said Mr March．'John has been so good to me．He is an excellent young man．'Mr March looked at Meg， who was staring at the fire， then he smiled at his wife．She smiled back．Jo understood exactly what the smiles were saying， and went out to the kitchen complaining to herself about 'excellent young men with brown eyes！'</p>
<p>马奇先生和白丝坐在一张大椅子上，其他人围坐在他们身边。“我想让你们所有人都吃一惊，医生让布鲁克先生带我回家了，”马奇先生说。“约翰一直对我很好。他是个很出色的人。”马奇先生看了看麦格，她正盯着炉火，于是他对妻子笑了笑。她也笑了。琼十分明白这微笑的含义，她走出来往厨房去，一边对自己抱怨着那“有着出色的棕色眼睛的年轻人”。</p>
<p>There never was a Christmas dinner like the one they had that day． Mr Laurence and his grandson ate with them， and so did Mr Brooke．Jo gave the tutor many black looks and would not speak to him， which amused Laurie．</p>
<p>往年的圣诞节晚餐从来都没有像他们那天吃过的那样。劳伦斯先生和他的孙子同他们一起吃的饭，布鲁克先生也去了。琼给了这位家庭教师许多的白眼，不肯跟他讲话，这让罗瑞觉得很有意思。</p>
<p>The guests left early and the happy family sat together around the fire．</p>
<p>客人们很早就离开了，快乐的一家围坐在炉火边。</p>
<p>'A year ago we were complaining about the awful Christmas we expected to have，do you remember？'said Jo．</p>
<p>“一年以前我们曾抱怨我们将要度过的那个糟糕的圣诞节，你们还记得吗？”琼说。</p>
<p>'It's been quite a good year，'said Meg， thinking about Mr Brooke．</p>
<p>“这一年真好，”麦格说道，心里想着布鲁克先生。</p>
<p>'I think it's been a hard one，'said Amy．</p>
<p>“我觉得这一年过得很艰辛，”艾米说。</p>
<p>'I'm glad it's over， because we've got Father back，'whispered Beth，who was sitting on his knee．</p>
<p>“我很高兴它终于结束了，因为父亲回来了，”白丝轻声说，她坐在他的膝头。</p>
<p>'I've discovered several things about you young ladies today，'said Mr March．</p>
<p>“今天我发现了你们这些年轻姑娘的一些事。”马奇先生说。</p>
<p>'Oh，tell us what they are！'cried Meg．</p>
<p>“噢，告诉我们是什么？”麦格喊道。</p>
<p>'Here's one，'he said， taking her hand． It had a small burnon the back and two or three little hard places on the front．'I remember when this hand was white and smooth．It was pretty then， but to me it's much prettier now．I'm proud of this hard-working hand，Meg．'</p>
<p>“这儿有一个，”他说，说着拿起她的手。那手背上有一小块烫痕，手心上有两三块硬块。“我记得这手曾经又白又嫩。它那时很美，可对我来说它现在更美，我为这双劳动的手而感到骄傲，麦格。”</p>
<p>'What about Jo？'whispered Beth．'She's tried so hard，and has been very， very good to me．'</p>
<p>“琼怎么样？”白丝轻声问道。“她那么努力，还对我非常非常好。”</p>
<p>He smiled and looked at Jo sitting opposite．'Her hair maybe short，but I see a young lady now． Her face is thin and white from worrying， but it has grown gentler．Perhaps I'll miss my wild girl，but I'm sure I'll love the warm-hearted woman who has taken her place．'</p>
<p>他笑了笑，看着坐在对面的琼。“她的头发可能是短了些，可我现在看到了一位年轻的淑女。她的脸削瘦，因为焦虑而苍白，可它变得更温柔了。也许我会想念我那个爱疯跑的孩子，可我肯定会爱这个取而代之的热心的妇人。”</p>
<p>Jo's face was red in the firelight as she listened．</p>
<p>琼听着，脸色在火光中变红了。</p>
<p>'Now Beth，'said Amy．</p>
<p>“该说白丝了，”艾米说。</p>
<p>'She's not as shy as she used to be，'said her father lovingly，and he held Beth close when he remembered how near they had come to losing her． Then he looked down at Amy by his feet．'I've noticed today that Amy has helped everyone patiently and with a smile．She's learned to think more about other people，and less about herself．'</p>
<p>“她不像从前那么害羞了，”她的父亲充满爱意地说，当他想起他们差点失去她时，他把白丝搂得很紧。然后他看了看坐在他脚边的艾米。“我今天注意到艾米耐心地、面带微笑地帮助每个人。她已经学会了多为别人着想，少想些自己。”</p>
<p>Beth moved out of her father's arms and went to the piano．She touched the keys softly and began to sing．Soon， the others joined her in a happy Christmas song．</p>
<p>白丝从父亲怀里下来，来到钢琴旁边。她轻轻地触动了琴键，开始唱歌。不久，其他人就跟她一起唱起了一支圣诞歌。</p>
<p>The next afternoon，Jo and Meg were sitting at the window when Laurie went by． When he saw Meg， he fell on one knee in the snow， beat his chest， and put out his arms towards her．When Meg told him to go away，he pretended to cry before walking away looking miserable．</p>
<p>第二天下午，琼和麦格正坐在窗边时，罗瑞正好路过。当他看见麦格的时候，他单膝跪倒在雪地里，捶打自己的胸口，并向她伸出双臂。当麦格告诉他走开时，他假装哭泣，然后面带痛苦地走了。</p>
<p>Meg laughed．'What was he doing？'she said．</p>
<p>麦格笑了。“他在干什么？”她问。</p>
<p>'He was showing you how your John will act，'answered Jo，crossly．</p>
<p>“他在向你演示你的约翰会对你怎么样。”琼面带怒气地说。</p>
<p>'Don't say my John，it isn't right．'But Meg said the words again silently inside her head．</p>
<p>“别说'我的约翰'，这不对，”可麦格在脑海里默默地又重复了那句话。</p>
<p>'If he asks yon to marry him，you'll cry or look stupid，in-stead of saying a loud No，'said Jo．</p>
<p>“如果他让你嫁给他，你会哭，或者看上去很蠢，而不会大声说不。”琼说。</p>
<p>'No，I won't，'said Meg．'I'll say，“Thank you，Mr Brooke，you are very kind，but I am too young to marry you．Please let us be friends，as we were．”'</p>
<p>“不，我不会的，”麦格说。“我会说，'谢谢你，布鲁克先生，你很好，可我太年轻了，不能嫁给你。让我们做朋友吧，就像从前那样。'”</p>
<p>'I don't believe it，'said Jo．</p>
<p>“我不相信，”琼说。</p>
<p>'It's true．Then I'll walk out of the room with my head high．'Meg got up and pretended to do it-but ran back to her seat when she heard someone knock on the door．</p>
<p>“是真的。我会高高地抬起头走出房间。”麦格站起来假装那样做——可当她听到有人敲门时她就跑回了座位。</p>
<p>Jo opened it with an angry look．</p>
<p>琼带着怒容打开了门。</p>
<p>'Good afternoon，'said Mr Brooke．'I came to get my umbrella，which I left behind yesterday．'</p>
<p>“下午好，”布鲁克先生说。“我来取我的伞，我昨天落在这儿了。”</p>
<p>'I'll get it，'said Jo，pushing past him．'Now Meg can tell him，'she thought．</p>
<p>“我去拿来，”琼说，赶快走过他。“现在麦格可以跟他讲了。”她想。</p>
<p>But Meg was moving to the door．'I expect Mother will want to see you，'she said．'I'll call her．'</p>
<p>可麦格正朝门走过来。“我想妈妈一定想见你，”她说。“我去叫她。”</p>
<p>'Don't go，'he said．'Are you afraid of me，Meg？''How can I be afraid when you've been so kind to Father，said Meg．'I wish I could thank you for it．''You can，'he said． And he took Meg's small hand in his and looked at her lovingly．</p>
<p>“别走，”他说。“你是不是怕我，麦格？”“你对父亲这么好，我怎么会怕你呢，”麦格说。“我想我要为此感谢你。”“你可以，”他说。他把麦格的小手放在他的手里，面带爱意。</p>
<p>'Oh，please don't，'she said，looking frightened．</p>
<p>“噢，请别这样，”她说，面带惧色。</p>
<p>'I only want to know if you love me a little，Meg，'he said gently．'I love you so much．'</p>
<p>“我想知道你是不是爱我一点点，麦格，”他温柔地说，“我太爱你了。”</p>
<p>This was the moment to repeat the words she had told Jo，but Meg forgot them all．'I don't know，'she said，so softly that John had to move closer to hear her reply．</p>
<p>此时正是她重复她刚才跟琼讲的话之时，可麦格把它们都忘了。“我不知道，”她说，她的声音太轻，以至于约翰得凑得更近一些，才能听见她的回答。</p>
<p>He smiled gratefully．'Will you try to find out？'</p>
<p>他感激地笑了。“你会试着弄明白吗？”</p>
<p>'I'm too young，'she said， hesitating but feeling her heart beating rather fast．</p>
<p>“我太年轻了，”她犹豫不决地说，可她感到自己的心跳得非常快。</p>
<p>'I'll wait while you learn to like me，'he said．'Will it be very difficult？'</p>
<p>“我会等着你学会喜欢我，”他说。“那会很困难吗？”</p>
<p>'Not if I choose to learn，'she said．</p>
<p>“如果我选择学就不难，”她说。</p>
<p>'Please choose，Meg．I love to teach，and this is easier than German，'said John， taking her other hand．</p>
<p>“那你就选择学吧，麦格，我喜欢教你，教这个比教德语容易，”约翰说着把她的另一只手也拿起来。</p>
<p>She looked at him and saw that he was smiling．He seemed so sure of success that Meg became a little annoyed．She felt excited and strange，and taking her hands away from his， she said，' I don't choose．Please go away！'</p>
<p>她看看他，见到他在微笑。他看上去必胜的样子使麦格感到有些生气。她感到激动和陌生，把她的手从他的手里抽回，她说：“我不选择。请走吧！”</p>
<p>Poor Mr Brooke looked shocked．'Do you mean that？'</p>
<p>可怜的布鲁克先生看上去很震惊。“你是当真？”</p>
<p>'Yes，'she said，rather enjoying the game she was playing．'I don't want to think about these things． It's to soon．''I'll wait until you've had more time，'he said，and looked so unhappy that Meg began to feel sorry for him．</p>
<p>“是的，”她说，对她玩的游戏感觉很有意思。“我不想想这些事。这来得太快了。”“我会等到你有更多的时间，”他说。他看上去那么不开心，麦格开始为他感到难过。</p>
<p>It was at this moment that Aunt March came in．She hadcome to see Mr March and was hoping to surprise the family．She did surprise two of them．Meg，with her face bright red，just stared at her aunt，while Mr Brooke hurried into another room．</p>
<p>正在这时，马奇姑妈走了进来。她来看马奇先生，希望使这家人大吃一惊。她确实使这两人吃了一惊。麦格脸涨得通红，只是瞪着她的姑妈，而布鲁克先生则赶紧走进了另一个房间。</p>
<p>'Goodness me， what's all this？'cried Aunt March．'It's Father's friend，said Meg hurriedly．'I'm so surprised to see you，Aunt March．'</p>
<p>“天哪，这都是怎么回事？”马奇姑妈喊道。“是爸爸的朋友，”麦格很快地说，“看见您真让我吃惊，马奇姑妈。”</p>
<p>'I can see that，'said Aunt March，sitting down．'What has he said to make your face turn pink？'</p>
<p>“我看得出来，”马奇姑妈说，边说边坐下来。“他说了些什么，让你的脸变红了？”</p>
<p>'Mr Brooke and I were just…talking，'said Meg．</p>
<p>“布鲁克先生和我只是在……谈话。”麦格说。</p>
<p>'Brooke？The boy's tutor？I understand now．I know all about it because I made Jo tell me．You haven't promised to marry him，have you，Meg？If you have，you won't get one bit of my money，do you hear？'</p>
<p>“布鲁克？那男孩的家庭教师？我现在明白了。我知道所有的一切，因为我让琼告诉我了。你没答应嫁给他，是吧，麦格？如果你答应了，你就不会从我这儿得到一点钱了，听到了吗？”</p>
<p>It was exactly the wrong thing to say．When Meg was ordered not to marry John Brooke，she immediately decided that She would．'I'll marry whoever I want to，Aunt March，and you can give your money to anyone you like！'she said．'You'll be sorry！'said Aunt March．'Why don't you mar-ry a rich man to help your family？'</p>
<p>那话恰恰说得不对。当麦格被命令不许嫁给约翰&middot;布鲁克时，她立即决定她要嫁给他。“我想嫁给谁就嫁给谁，马奇姑妈，你可以把你的钱给任何你喜欢的人！”她说。“你会后悔的！”马奇姑妈说。“你为什么不嫁给一个富人，帮帮你的家人？”</p>
<p>'Father and Mother like John，although he's poor，'said Meg．</p>
<p>“爸爸和妈妈喜欢约翰，虽然他穷。”麦格说。</p>
<p>'Be sensible，Meg，'said her aunt．'He knows I have money，and that's why he likes you，I suspect．'</p>
<p>“理智点，麦格，”她的姑妈说，“他知道我有钱，我怀疑他正是为此而喜欢你。”</p>
<p>'Don't say that！'said Meg．'My John wouldn't marry for money any more than I would！We'll work and wait，and I'll132be happy with him because he loves me，and Meg stopped as she remembered that she had told'her John'to go away．</p>
<p>“不许那么说，”麦格说。“我的约翰不会为钱而结婚，我也不会！我们会工作，会等待，我和他在一起会感觉很幸福，因为他爱我，还有——”麦格停了下来，因为她想起她已经告诉“她的约翰”走开了。</p>
<p>Aunt March was very angry．'Just don't expect anything from me when you are married！'she said．And she went out of the room，banging the door behind her．</p>
<p>马奇姑妈非常生气。“等你结婚时别想从我这儿得到任何东西！”她说，然后摔门而去。</p>
<p>Meg didn't know whether to laugh or cry． Before she could decide，Mr Brooke came back in from the next room and puthis arms around her．'Oh Meg，I could hear your voices，'he said．'Thank you for proving that you do love me a little．''I didn't know how much until she said those things about you，'said Meg．</p>
<p>麦格不知道该笑还是该哭。在她做出决定之前，布鲁克先生从隔壁房间走回来，用双臂搂住她。“噢，麦格，我能听到你的声音，”他说。“谢谢你证明了你确实有一点爱我。”“在她说那些关于你的话之前我不知道有多少，”麦格说。</p>
<p>'So I can stay， and be happy？' he said．</p>
<p>“那么我能留下来高兴高兴了？”他说。</p>
<p>'Yes，John，'she whispered，and hid her face on John's chest．</p>
<p>“是的，约翰，”她轻声说，将她的脸埋在约翰胸前。</p>
<p>Jo returned and found them like that．Meg jumped and turned round，but John Brooke laughed and kissed the shocked Jo，saying，'Sister Jo．Wish us luck！'</p>
<p>琼回来了，发现他们在那样。麦格跳起来转过身，可约翰&middot;布鲁克笑了，他吻了吻受了惊吓的琼，说：“琼妹妹，祝我们好运吧！”</p>
<p>Jo ran upstairs to find her parents．'Go down quickly！'she said．'John Brooke is behaving terribly and Meg likes it！'Mr and Mrs March left the room in a hurry，while Jo threw herself on the bed and told the awful news to Beth and Amy．But the little girls thought it was all most interesting and delightful．</p>
<p>琼跑上楼找到她的父母。“快下楼去！”她说，“约翰&middot;布鲁克表现很不好，麦格却很喜欢！”马奇先生和马奇太太赶紧离开了房间，琼扑倒在床上，又把这糟糕的消息告诉了白丝和艾米。可小女孩们觉得这很是有趣和令人高兴。</p>
<p>Nobody knew what was said that afternoon，but a lot of talking was done． The quiet Mr Brooke managed to persuadehis friends that his plans were good and sensible，then he proudly took Meg in to supper．Everyone looked so happy that Jo tried to look pleased too．</p>
<p>没人知道那天下午都有些什么谈话，可大家谈了许多。文静的布鲁克先生成功地说服了他的朋友，他的计划是很好的，有理智的，然后他骄傲地把麦格带进来吃晚饭。每个人看上去都很高兴，琼也尽力看上去很高兴。</p>
<p>After supper， Laurie arrived with some flowers for'Mrs John Brooke'，then he followed Jo into the corner of the room while the others went to welcome old Mr Laurence．</p>
<p>晚饭后，罗瑞带着给“约翰&middot;布鲁克太太”的鲜花来了。当其他人去迎接劳伦斯先生的时候，他跟着琼来到屋子的一个角落。</p>
<p>'What's the matter，Jo？' said Laurie．'You don't look very happy．'</p>
<p>“出什么事了，琼？”罗瑞说。“你看上去不太高兴。”</p>
<p>'Nothing will ever be the same again，'said Jo sadly．'I've lost my dearest friend．'</p>
<p>“一切都跟从前不再相同了，”琼悲伤地说。“我失去了最好的朋友。”</p>
<p>'You've got me，'said Laurie．'I'm not good for much，but I promise I'll always be your friend，Jo．'</p>
<p>“你有我呢，”罗瑞说。“我不一定很好，可我发誓我会永远是你的朋友，琼。”</p>
<p>'I know you will，'answered Jo，gratefully．</p>
<p>“我知道你会的，”琼感激地说。</p>
<p>'Then don't be sad，'he said．'I'll be back from college in three years time， and then we'll go abroad，or on a nice trip somewhere．Wouldn't that cheer you up？'</p>
<p>“那别伤心了，”他说。“我三年之后就会大学毕业，然后我们就出国，或者去什么地方好好旅行一番。那会让你高兴一点吗？”</p>
<p>'Anything can happen in three years，'said Jo．</p>
<p>“三年里什么都会发生，”琼说。</p>
<p>'That's true，'said Laurie．'Don't you wish you knew what was going to happen？'</p>
<p>“是的，”罗瑞说。“你希望知道将会发生什么吗？”</p>
<p>'I don't think so，'said Jo．'It may be something sad，and everyone looks so happy now．'As she spoke，she looked round the room，and her face brightened at the sight．</p>
<p>“我不希望，”琼说。“可能会是伤心的事，现在每个人看上去都很高兴。”当她说这话时，她环顾屋内，她看到的景象使她高兴起来。</p>
<p>Father and Mother sat happily together．Amy was drawing a picture of Meg and John， who were looking lovingly at each other．Beth lay on the floor，talking to her old friend，Mr Laurence．Jo sat in her favourite chair with a serious，quietlook on her face . Laurie smiled at her in the long mirror that was opposite them both . And Jo smiled back.</p>
<p>爸爸和妈妈快乐地坐在一起。艾米在为麦格和约翰画画，那两个人相互爱恋地对望着。白丝躺在地板上和她的老朋友劳伦斯先生聊天。琼在她最喜欢的椅子上坐下，面带严肃安静的表情。罗瑞从他们对面的长镜中对她微笑，琼也朝他微笑。</p></body></html>
