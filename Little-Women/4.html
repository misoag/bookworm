<p><b>4 隔壁的房子 </b></p>
<p>'It's so nice to go to parties and drive home in carriages．'said Mea，the next morning．'Other people live like that all the time，and I wish we could．I wish we were rich．'</p>
<p>“去参加舞会然后坐马车回家真好，”第二天早晨麦格说道。“其他人一直都是这样生活的，真希望我们也是。真希望我们是富有的。”</p>
<p>'Well， we're not，'said Jo．' So we must do our work with a smile，the way Mother does．'</p>
<p>“哎，我们不富有，”琼说，“所以我们必须面带微笑做我们的工作，就像妈妈那样。”</p>
<p>Mr March had lost most of his money helping a friend．When the two older girls discovered this，they wanted to do something to earn some money for the family， and as soon as they were old enough，they found work．Meg got a job teach ing four small children．It was hard for her to be poor because she could remember the time when their home had been beautiful，with every thing they wanted． And every day at Mrs King's house she saw pretty dresses，and heard talk of parties and the theatre-all the things which Meg loved．</p>
<p>马奇先生为了帮助一位朋友失去了他的大部分钱。当两个年长的女孩子发现这件事时，她们就想要做些事来帮家里挣钱。她们等年龄一到，就去找工作。麦格找到了一份给四个小孩教课的工作。对她来说贫困是艰难的，因为她能记得当初家里是多么漂亮，她们要什么有什么。每天在金太太的家里她都能看到漂亮的衣服，听到有关舞会和剧院的议论——这些都是麦格所热衷的。</p>
<p>Jo went to Aunt March，who needed someone to fetch and carry things，and read to her．She was a difficult old lady who complained a lot，but Jo did her best．</p>
<p>琼到了马奇姑妈家，她需要有人帮她拿取东西，给她读文章。她是个很难缠的老太太，经常抱怨，可琼尽力而为。</p>
<p>Beth was much too shy to go to school with other children，so she studied at home with her father． When he went away，and her mother was busy with war work， Beth continued to study by herself and helped Hannah keep the home tidy for the others． She also spent long，quiet hours alone，talking to her dolls or playing the old piano．Beth loved music and，although the family could not afford music lessons or a good piano for her， she tried hard to make herself a better musician．</p>
<p>白丝太害羞，不愿跟其他孩子一起上学，于是她呆在家里跟父亲学习。父亲走了之后，母亲忙于战争方面的工作，白丝就继续自学，同时帮助海娜为其他人整理房间。她也常常花很长时间安静地独处，和她的玩具娃娃说话，或者弹那架旧钢琴。白丝热爱音乐，虽然家里不能供她上音乐课或买架好钢琴给她，她还是努力使自己成为一名更好的音乐家。</p>
<p>Amy drew the most beautiful pictures and wanted to be a fa mous painter one day．She was a favoturite with everyone， except when she complained abut having to wear her cousin's old clothes because her mother could not afford to buy new ones for her．</p>
<p>艾米会画最漂亮的画，她希望有一天能成为名画家。她很讨大家的喜欢，不过当母亲由于买不起新衣服而让她穿上表姐的旧衣服、她发牢骚的时候，情形就不同了。</p>
<p>One afternoon a week or two later， Jo went outside to clear the snow away from some of the garden so that Beth could walk there when the sun came out．She looked across to the house next door-a big stone house with lovely things inside that Jo occasionally saw through the open curtains at the windows．But it seemed a lonely， lifeless kind of house， as no children played outside， no motherly face smiled at the windows， and not many people went in and out， except the old gentleman and his grandson．</p>
<p>一两个星期以后的一个下午，琼到外面去，想把花园里的部分雪清扫掉，这样白丝就可以在太阳出来时到那儿去散步了。她朝隔壁的房子看过去——那是座大砖房，里面有很多漂亮的东西，琼有时会从那些打开窗帘的窗户看到里面。可它看上去像是一座孤独的毫无生气的房子，没有孩子在外面玩，没有窗边慈母的笑脸，也没有许多进进出出的人，只有那个老先生和他的孙子。</p>
<p>She had not seen the Laurence boy lately and wondered if he was away， but suddenly she saw him looking out of an upstairs window ．She threw up a handful of soft show and called out，'Are you ill？'</p>
<p>她后来一直没有见到劳伦斯家的男孩，她怀疑他已经走了，可突然间，她见到他正从楼上的一扇窗户朝外张望。她向上扔了一把松软的雪，喊道：“你是病了吗？”</p>
<p>Laurie opened the window'm almost better， thank you，'he said．'I've had a bad cold．'</p>
<p>罗瑞打开窗户。“我好多了，谢谢，”他说。“我得了重感冒。”</p>
<p>'What do you find to do？'said Jo．</p>
<p>“你都做些什么？”琼问。</p>
<p>'Nothing，'he said．'They won't let me．'</p>
<p>“什么都不做，”他回答。“他们不让我做。”</p>
<p>'Why don't you get someone to come and see you？'</p>
<p>“你为什么不让别人去看你呢？”</p>
<p>'I don't know anyone．'</p>
<p>“我谁也不认识。”</p>
<p>'You know us，'said Jo．</p>
<p>“你认识我们啊，”琼道。</p>
<p>'So I do！'laughed Laurie．'Will you come，please？'</p>
<p>“那当然！”罗瑞笑了。“你愿意来吗？”</p>
<p>'I'll come if Mother will let me． I'll go and ask her． Shut the window and wait until I come．'</p>
<p>“如果妈妈同意我就来。我去问她。关上窗户等着我。”</p>
<p>Laurie was excited and began to get ready for Jo's visit．He brushed his hair and tried to make his room tidy．Soon after， he heard voices downstairs，then a surprised servant ran up to his room．</p>
<p>罗瑞很兴奋，开始为琼的来访做准备。他梳了头，尽量把他的房屋弄整齐。过了不久，他听到楼下有动静，然后一个吃了一惊的仆人跑上他的房间。</p>
<p>There's a young lady to see you， sir，'she said．</p>
<p>“有位年轻的女士来看您，先生，”她说。</p>
<p>A moment later，Jo appeared with a box in one hand and Beth's three small cats in the other． 'Mother sends her love，'she said．'Meg asked me to bring some of her cake， and Beth thought you would like to play with her cats． Isn't she funny？'</p>
<p>片刻，琼出现了，一只手抱着一个盆子，另一只手抱着白丝的三只小猫。“妈妈向你问好，”她说。“麦格叫我给你带些好的蛋糕来。白丝认为你会喜欢跟她的小猫玩儿。她是不是很有意思？”</p>
<p>Laurie laughed How kind you all are，'he said．</p>
<p>罗瑞笑着说：“你们真好。”</p>
<p>'Shall I read to you？'sald Jo．</p>
<p>“我给你读文章怎么样？”琼说。</p>
<p>'I'd rather talk，'he said．</p>
<p>“我宁愿聊聊天。”他答道。</p>
<p>'I can talk all day，'said Jo，smiling．'Beth says I never know when to stop．'</p>
<p>“我可以聊一整天，”琼笑答。“白丝说我总是不知道在哪儿告一段落。”</p>
<p>'Is Beth the one who stays at home？'</p>
<p>“白丝是那个呆在家里的孩子吗？”</p>
<p>'Yes，that's Beth．She's a good girl．'</p>
<p>“是的，那是白丝。她是个好孩子。”</p>
<p>'The pretty one is Meg，and the curly－haired one is Amy， is that right？' he said．</p>
<p>“漂亮的那个是麦格，卷头发的那个是艾米，对吗？”罗瑞问。</p>
<p>'Yes．How did you know？'</p>
<p>“是的，你怎么知道？”</p>
<p>Laurie's face became red．'I hear you calling to each other，and you always seem to be having so much fun．Sometimes，in the evenings，you forget to close your curtains and I can see you sitting round the fire with your mother．I haven't got a mother．'</p>
<p>罗瑞的脸红了。“我听到你们互相喊对方。你们看起来总有很多有趣的事。有时候，晚上你们忘记拉窗帘，我能看见你们和母亲一起坐在炉火边。我没有母亲。”</p>
<p>Jo saw the sadness in his eyes．'Why don't you come over and see us？ Would your grandfather let you？'</p>
<p>琼看到了他眼中的悲伤。“你干吗不到我家来看我们？你祖父会让你来吗？”</p>
<p>'Perhaps，if your mother asked him，'said Laurie．'He spends a lot of time among his books，and Mr Brooke，my tutor，doesn't live here．So I haven't anyone to go out with．Do you like your school？'</p>
<p>“可能，如果你母亲跟他讲的话，”罗瑞说，“他花很多时间看书，而我的家庭教师布鲁克先生不住在这儿，所以没人和我一起出去。你喜欢你的学校吗？”</p>
<p>'I don't go to school．I go out to work-to my aunt's，'said Jo．She described the difficult old lady and made him laugh with her stories． She told him all about her sisters，the plays they acted，and their hopes and fears for their father．Then they talked about books， and Jo discovered that Laurie loved them as much as she did．</p>
<p>“我没上学。我去工作——到我姑妈家，”琼回答。她描述了那个难缠的老太太，她的故事让他发笑。她告诉他关于她的姐妹的所有事，她们演过的剧，以及她们对父亲的期盼和担忧。然后他们谈到了书籍，琼发现罗瑞像她一样爱书。</p>
<p>'Come and see our library，'he said．'Grandfather is out，so you needn't be afraid．'</p>
<p>“到我们的图书室来，”他说。“祖父出门了，所以你不用怕。”</p>
<p>'I 'm not afraid of anything，' replied Jo．</p>
<p>“我什么也不怕，”琼答道。</p>
<p>He took her down to a room where the walls were covered with books and pictures．</p>
<p>他带她来到楼下的一个房间，那里四壁都为书籍和画所遮盖。</p>
<p>'You should be the happiest boy in the world！'said Jo，sitting in a big armchair and looking round．</p>
<p>“你应该是世界上最幸福的男孩！”琼叹道，边说边坐进一张大扶手椅，环顾四周。</p>
<p>'A person can't live on books，'he said．</p>
<p>“一个人不能靠书生活，”他说。</p>
<p>Suddenly，a bell rang．</p>
<p>突然，铃响了。</p>
<p>Jo jumped up out of the chair．It's your grand father！'she said．</p>
<p>琼从椅子上跳起来。“是你祖父！”她说。</p>
<p>'What if it is？'said Laurie， with a smile．'You're not afraid of anything， remember？'</p>
<p>“是又怎样？”罗瑞笑着说，“你什么都不怕，记得吗？”</p>
<p>'Perhaps I am a little bit afraid of him，'said Jo．</p>
<p>“也许我有一点点怕他，”琼说。</p>
<p>The servant came in at that moment．'The doctor is here to see you， sir，'she said to Laurie．</p>
<p>此时仆人走进来。“医生来看您了，先生，”她对罗瑞说。</p>
<p>'Can I leave you for a minute or two， Jo？'he said．</p>
<p>“我能离开一两分钟吗，琼？”他说。</p>
<p>'Yes， I'm very happy here，'said Jo．</p>
<p>“可以，我很高兴呆在这儿，”琼答道。</p>
<p>He went away and Jo was staring at a large picture of the old gentleman when the door opened again without turning，she said，'I won't be afraid of him， because he's got kind eyes，although his mouth looks hard and cold．He's not as handsome as my grandfather， but I like him．'</p>
<p>他走开了。当琼正在端详那位老先生的一大幅画像时，门又开了。她没有转过身，说道：“我不害怕他，因为虽然他的嘴巴看上去又硬又冷，他的眼睛却很和善。他不像我祖父那么英俊，可我喜欢他。”</p>
<p>'Thank you，'said a deep voice behind her．</p>
<p>“谢谢你，”她背后有一个深沉的声音说。</p>
<p>She turned quickly-and saw old Mr Laurence！</p>
<p>她很快转过身——看到了老劳伦斯先生！</p>
<p>Jo's face turned a bright red and she wanted to run away．But the old man's eyes looked kinder than those in the picture and seemed to have a smile in them ．</p>
<p>琼的脸变得通红，她想跑掉。可那位老先生的眼睛看上去比画像里的还要和善，好像还带着笑意。</p>
<p>'So you're not afraid of me，eh？'he said．</p>
<p>“看来你不怕我，啊？”他问道。</p>
<p>'Not much，sir．'</p>
<p>“不太怕，先生。”</p>
<p>'But I'm not as handsome as your grandfather？'</p>
<p>“可我不如你祖父长得英俊？”</p>
<p>'Not quite，sir．'</p>
<p>“不如，先生。”</p>
<p>'But you like me．'He laughed and shook hands with her．</p>
<p>“可你喜欢我。”他笑着和她握握手。</p>
<p>'Now，what have you been doing with my grandson？'</p>
<p>“现在告诉我，你和我孙子一起干了些什么？”</p>
<p>'Trying to cheer him up， sir，' said Jo．'He seems a bit lonely．'</p>
<p>“我尽力使他高兴起来，先生。”琼答道。“他看上去有些孤独。”</p>
<p>'Then come and have some tea with us．'</p>
<p>“那来和我们一起喝点茶吧。”</p>
<p>Laurie was very surprised to see Jo with his grandfather，but was soon talking and laughing happily with Jo．The old man watched the two young people and noticed the change in his grandson．'She's right，'he thought．The boy does need cheering up．'</p>
<p>罗瑞看到琼和他祖父在一起很吃惊，可不久就高兴地和琼说说笑笑起来。老人望着两个年轻人，察觉到了他孙子的变化。“她是对的，”他想，“这孩子需要高兴起来。”</p>
<p>After tea， they went into a room where there was a large and beautiful piano．</p>
<p>喝过茶，他们来到一个房间，里面摆着一架漂亮的大钢琴。</p>
<p>'Do you play？'Jo asked Laurie．</p>
<p>“你弹琴吗？”琼问罗瑞。</p>
<p>'Sometimes，'he answered．</p>
<p>“有时弹，”他答道。</p>
<p>'Play now． I want to hear it so I can tell Beth．'</p>
<p>“现在就弹吧，我得听听，好去告诉白丝。”</p>
<p>So Laurie played and Jo listened．Afterwards，Mr Laurence said，'He plays quite well，but I want him to do well in more important things． Now， I hope you'll come again．'He shook hands with her．'Goodnight，Jo．'</p>
<p>然后罗瑞弹起钢琴，琼听着，之后，劳伦斯先生说：“他弹得很好，可我要他把更重要的事情做好。那好，希望你能再来。”他跟她握了握手。“晚安，琼。”</p>
<p>Laurie walked to the door with her．'He doesn't like to hear me play，'he said．</p>
<p>罗瑞随她走到门口。“他不喜欢我弹琴，”他说。</p>
<p>'why not？' said Jo．</p>
<p>“为什么不？”琼问。</p>
<p>'I'll tell you one day，'he said．</p>
<p>“我改天会告诉你的。”他回答。</p>
<p>When Jo told the family of her afternoon's adventures， they all wanted to go and visit the big house．</p>
<p>当琼告诉家人她下午的经历后，她们也都很想去看看那座大房子。</p>
<p>'Mother，why doesn't Mr Laurence like to hear Laurie play the piano？'asked Jo．</p>
<p>“妈妈，为什么劳伦斯先生不喜欢听罗瑞弹琴？”琼问。</p>
<p>'Laurie's father married an Italian lady， a musician，' said Mrs March．'The old man didn't like her， and never saw his son after they were married．Laurie was born in Italy， but his parents died when he was a child，and his grandfather brought him home．Laurie loves music and I expect his grand father is afraid he'll want to be a musician like his mother．'</p>
<p>“罗瑞的父亲娶了一个意大利女人，她是个钢琴师，”马奇太太说。“老人不喜欢她，自从他们结婚后就再也没见他的儿子。罗瑞出生在意大利，可在他小时候他父母就去世了。他祖父把他接到家里来。罗瑞很喜欢音乐。我想他祖父一定是怕他想成为他母亲那样的音乐师。”</p>
<p>Laurie should be a musician if he wants to be，'said Jo．'Sending him to college will just make him unhappy．'</p>
<p>“罗瑞如果愿意，他就应该做音乐师，”琼说。“把他送到大学去只会让他不快乐。”</p><a href='5.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
