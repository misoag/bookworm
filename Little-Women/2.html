<p><b>2 快乐的圣诞节 </b></p>
<p>Jo was the first to wake up on Christmas morning，but soon they were all awake and they went downstairs．</p>
<p>圣诞节清晨，琼是第一个醒来的，可随后她们就都醒了，然后下了楼。</p>
<p>'Where's Mother？'asked Meg．</p>
<p>“妈妈在哪儿？”麦格问。</p>
<p>'I don't know，'said old Hannah．She had lived with the family since Meg was born，and was more like a friend than a servant．'Some poor woman came to the door and your mother went off to see what was needed．'</p>
<p>“我不知道，”老海娜答道。她从麦格一出世就和全家住在一起，就像是一个朋友，而不像仆人。“有个可怜的女人来到门口，你们的母亲随她去了，好看看她需要什么。”</p>
<p>'She'll be back soon，'said Meg． She looked at the presents for her mother which were in a basket under a chair， ready to bring out at the right time．'Where is Amy's bottle of perfume？'</p>
<p>“她很快就会回来的，”麦格说。她看了看那些给母亲的礼物，它们被装在一个篮子里，放在椅子下面，时刻准备拿出来。“艾米的那瓶香水呢？”</p>
<p>She went to put some pretty paper round it，I think，'said Jo．</p>
<p>“我想她是想拿去包上些漂亮的纸，”琼答道。</p>
<p>Suddenly， they heard the outside door close．</p>
<p>突然，她们听到外面的门被关上了。</p>
<p>'Here's Mother！ Hide the basket， quick！' said Jo．</p>
<p>“妈妈来了，把篮子藏起来，快！”琼说。</p>
<p>But it was Amy．She came in quickly．</p>
<p>但那是艾米。她匆匆走进屋。</p>
<p>'Where have you been，and what's that behind you？'asked Meg．</p>
<p>“你到哪儿去了，藏在你身后的是什么？”麦格问。</p>
<p>'I ran to the shop and changed the little bottle of perfume for a big one，'said Amy．'I spent all my money to get it，and I'm not going to be selfish any more！'</p>
<p>“我跑到商店去了，把那瓶香水换成了一大瓶，”艾米说，“我花掉了所有的钱，我再也不自私了！”</p>
<p>Meg smiled proudly and put her arms around her sister．Then there was another bang from the outside door， and the basket was pushed back under the chair．The girls ran to the table， ready for their breakfast．</p>
<p>麦格骄傲地笑了，伸出双臂拥抱她的妹妹。然后外面的门又有响动了，篮子被推到了椅子下面。女孩子们跑到桌边坐定，准备吃早餐。</p>
<p>'Happy Christmas， Mother！'they shouted．</p>
<p>“圣诞快乐，妈妈！”她们喊道。</p>
<p>Happy Christmas，little daughters！'said Mrs March．</p>
<p>“圣诞快乐，小女儿们！”马奇太太应道。</p>
<p>Then the smile disappeared from her face．'Girls，listen．Not far away is a poor woman，Mrs Hummel，with a new baby．Her six children are in one bed， trying to keep warm，as they have no wood for a fire．There is nothing to eat and they are hungry and cold．Will you give them your breakfast as a Christmas present？</p>
<p>随后笑容从她脸上消失了。“孩子们，听着，不远处有个穷妇人，哈梅尔太太，她有个刚降生的婴儿。她的六个孩子挤在一张床上取暖，因为他们没有木柴生火。他们没有吃的，又饿又冷。你们把你们的早餐送给他们做圣诞礼物怎么样？”</p>
<p>For a minute no one spoke．Then Jo said，'Mother， I'm so glad you came back before we began to eat！'And the girls quickly began to put their breakfast in a basket．</p>
<p>有一阵子没人说话。然后琼说：“妈妈，我很高兴你在我们开始吃饭之前回来！”孩子们开始很快地将她们的早餐放到一个篮子里。</p>
<p>'I knew you would do it，'said Mrs March，smiling．</p>
<p>“我知道你们会这样做的，”马奇太太微笑着说。</p>
<p>She took the girls and Hannah to a cold ， miserable little room in an old building， where they found a sick mother， a crying baby，and a group of children with white，frightened faces．The children were on the bed under a blanket，trying to keep warm．</p>
<p>她把孩子们和海娜带到位于一座旧楼里的一间又冷又破的小屋里。在那里她们见到了一位生病的母亲，一个正在啼哭的婴儿，和一帮面容苍白、满脸恐惧的孩子。那些孩子挤在床上的一张毛毯里，试图以此取暖。</p>
<p>The woman almost cried with happiness when she saw the girls．Hannah，who had brought wood，made a fire． Mrs March gave the mother tea and hot food，then she dressed the little baby gently．The girls put the children round the fire and fed them like hungry birds．</p>
<p>那妇人见到女孩子们后高兴得几乎哭出来。海娜带来了木柴，燃起了炉火。马奇太太把茶和热气腾腾的食物交给了那位母亲，并轻柔地给婴儿穿衣服。女孩子们则把其他孩子抱到炉火旁边，然后像喂小鸟一样喂给他们东西吃。</p>
<p>It was a very happy meal， although the girls ate none of it．But no one was happier than those hungry young ladies who gave away their breakfast on Christmas morning．</p>
<p>那顿饭吃得很高兴，虽然女孩子们并没有吃到东西。可没有任何人能比这些在圣诞节早晨将早餐送给别人的饿肚子的女孩子更高兴了。</p>
<p>Mrs March was surprised and pleased when she saw her presents later．There was a lot of laughing and kissing and explaining．Then，for the rest of the day，the girls were busy．Jo liked to write plays，and the four of them were going to act one that evening．They had learned their words， and had worked hard to make strange and wonderful clothes for all the different characters in the play．</p>
<p>马奇太太随后看到她的礼物时又惊又喜。此后是一阵大笑、亲吻和解释。然后，那天剩下的时光里女孩子们都忙忙碌碌的。琼喜欢写剧本，那天晚上她们四个就要演其中一个剧。她们已经记住了台词，还费力地为剧中的不同人物做了怪异和精彩的服装。</p>
<p>On Christmas night， some other girls came to watch． At first，there was a lot of whispering and laughing from the four sisters behind the curtains．Then the curtains were opened and the play began．</p>
<p>圣诞节晚上，其他一些女孩子都来看表演。一开始，幕后传出了四姐妹的许多低语和笑声，然后，幕帘开启，演出开始。</p>
<p>It was an exciting story about Hugo（acted by Jo wearing a black beard！）， beautiful Zara and brave Roderigo．There were also two ghosts，a cruel king，and a tall castle made of paper and wool-which unfortunately fell down just as Roderigo and Zara were escaping from it．There were screams of laughter from everyone， but the actors picked the mselves up and carried on through more dangers and mysteries until the happy ending was reached．</p>
<p>那是一个关于雨果、美丽的赞拉和勇敢的罗德里歌的激动人心的故事（雨果由琼扮演，她戴着一撮黑胡子！）。还有两个鬼魂、一个残暴的国王以及一个由纸和木头做成的城堡。不幸的是，当罗德里歌和赞拉从城堡中出逃时，城堡塌了下来。所有观众都尖声大笑，可演员们将城堡扶起，又历经许多的风险和神秘，最终获得了幸福的结局。</p>
<p>All the visitors loved the play，and after the excitement and fun came a surprise for everyone．</p>
<p>每个来访者都十分喜欢那出剧。这件令人激动、妙趣横生的事件过后，发生了一件令每个人都吃惊的事。</p>
<p>'would the young ladles like to stay for supper？'asked Hannah．</p>
<p>“你们这些年轻小姐都留下来吃晚饭好吗？”海娜问道。</p>
<p>And when the girls saw the supper table，they could not believe their eyes！There was ice-cream， cake，fruit，and French chocolate！ And in the middle of the table were flowers for each of the four actors．</p>
<p>当女孩子们看见餐桌的时候，她们简直不敢相信自己的眼睛！冰淇淋、蛋糕、水果和法国巧克力！在桌子正中还摆着给四位演员每人一束鲜花！</p>
<p>'Where did it all come from？'asked Amy．</p>
<p>“哪来的？”艾米问。</p>
<p>'From Father Christmas， perhaps？'said Beth．</p>
<p>“可能是圣诞老人送来的，”白丝说。</p>
<p>'Mother did it，'said Meg．</p>
<p>“妈妈做的，”麦格说。</p>
<p>Aunt March sent it，'said Jo．</p>
<p>“马奇姑妈送来的，”琼说。</p>
<p>'You're all wrong，'laughed Mrs March．'Old Mr Laurence sent it！'</p>
<p>“你们都错了，”马奇太太笑着说，“是老劳伦斯先生送来的！”</p>
<p>'The Laurence boy's grandfather？'said Meg．'But we don't know him．'</p>
<p>“是那个劳伦斯家的小男孩的祖父？”麦格问，“可我们不认识他呀。”</p>
<p>'Hannah told his servant about your breakfast party， and that pleased him，'said Mrs March．'He knew my faher many years ago，and he sent me a note this afternoon，asking if he could send my cbildren a few small Christmas presents．'</p>
<p>“海娜给他的仆人讲了你们的早餐聚会，那让他感到很高兴，”马奇太太说，“很多年前他就认识我父亲。今天下午他送来张纸条，问他可否给我的孩子送些圣诞礼物。”</p>
<p>'The idea came from that boy，I know it did！'said Jo．'I'm sure he wants to know us，but he's shy，and Meg won't let me speak to him when we pass him in the street．She says that it's not at all polite for young ladies to introduce themselves to strangers．</p>
<p>“这一定是那个男孩的主意，我知道，”琼说，“他一定是想认识我们，可他很怕羞。我们在街上碰到他时麦格不让我跟他讲话。她说女孩子主动跟陌生人搭讪太没礼貌。”</p>
<p>'You mean the people who live in the big house next door，don't you？'said one of the other girls．'My mother knows old Mr Laurence． She says he keeps his grandson in the house when the boy isn't riding or walking with his tutor， and makes him study very hard．We invited the boy to our party but he didn't come．'</p>
<p>“你是说住在隔壁大房子里的人吗？”其他女孩子中的一个问。“我妈妈认识劳伦斯先生。她说除了骑马和跟家庭教师散步，他总让孙子呆在屋里，让他用功学习。我们曾邀请那男孩参加我们的聚会，可他没来。”</p>
<p>'That boy needs to have some fun，'said Jo．</p>
<p>“那个男孩需要些乐趣，”琼说。</p><a href='3.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
