<p><b>7 麦格听到了闲言碎语 </b></p>
<p>Annie Moffat did not forget her promised invitation，and one April day Meg went to stay at the Moffats'large house．Meg thought it was wonderful．She loved riding in fine carriages，wearing her best dress every day，and doing nothing except enjoy herself．She soon began to talk about fashionable clothes and hairstyles in the way that the other girls did．And the more Meg saw of Annie's pretty things，the more she wished that she，too，was rich．</p>
<p>安妮&middot;墨菲没有忘记她答应过的邀请，一个春日，麦格来到了墨菲家的大房子里。麦格觉得这太好了。她喜欢坐漂亮的马车，每天都穿着她最好的衣服，除了玩乐以外不做任何事情。不久她就开始像其他女孩子一样谈论起时髦的衣服和发型来。麦格见到安妮的漂亮东西越多，她就越希望自己也一样地富有。</p>
<p>Annie's older sisters，Belle and Clara，were fine young ladies；Mr Moffat was a fat，friendly gentleman；and Mrs Moffat was a fat，friendly lady．They were all very kind to Meg and did their best to make her feel at home．</p>
<p>安妮的姐姐白拉和克拉拉都是很好的姑娘；墨菲先生是个胖胖的友好的绅士；墨菲太太是个胖胖的友好的女士。他们对麦格都很好，并且尽他们的所能使麦格就像在家里一样舒适。</p>
<p>When the evening for a'small party'came，Meg's best dress looked very old next to Sallie's new one，but no one said anything about it．The girls were getting ready when a servant brought in a box of flowers．</p>
<p>晚上小型聚会的时候，麦格最好的衣服比起萨丽的新衣服来显得很旧，可没有任何人说起这件事。女孩子们正在做准备，这时仆人送来一盒花。</p>
<p>'For Miss March，'she said．'And here's a letter．'</p>
<p>“给马奇小姐的，”她说，“这儿有封信。”</p>
<p>'What fun！Who are they from？'said the girls．'We didn't know you had a young man．'</p>
<p>“多有意思！是谁送的？”女孩子们问，“我们可不知道你还有个年轻的绅士。”</p>
<p>'The letter is from Mother and the flowers are from Laurie，'said Meg，simply．</p>
<p>“信是妈妈送来的，花是罗瑞送的，”麦格简单地说。</p>
<p>'Oh，'said Annie，with a strange look．</p>
<p>“噢，”萨丽说，带着一种奇怪的表情。</p>
<p>Her mother's loving words and Laurie's kindness made Meg feel much happier and she enjoyed the party very much．</p>
<p>母亲充满爱的话语和罗瑞的善良使麦格感到更加高兴，舞会上她玩得很开心。</p>
<p>Annie made her sing，and someone said that Meg had a fine voice．So Meg was having a nice time—until she heard some one say，on the other side of a large table of flowers：'How old is the Laurence boy？'</p>
<p>安妮让麦格唱歌，有人说她有一副好嗓子。于是麦格很愉快——直到她听到一大桌子花的那边有人在说话：“劳伦斯家的男孩有多大了？”</p>
<p>'Sixteen or seventeen，I think，'said another voice．</p>
<p>“十六七岁吧，我觉得，”另一个声音说。</p>
<p>'It would be an excellent thing for one of those girls，'said a third voice．'Sallie says they are very friendly，and the old man thinks they are all wonderful．'</p>
<p>“这对那几个女孩子之中的一个倒是太合适了，”第三个声音说，“萨丽说她们都很友好，那个老头也觉得她们都很不错。”</p>
<p>'I expect Mrs M．has made her plans，'said Mrs Moffat's voice，'but do you think the girl knows of them？'</p>
<p>“我觉得马奇太太是早有打算了，”墨菲太太说，“可你们觉得那女孩子知道这些吗？”</p>
<p>'She told that little lie about her mother，and her cheeks went pink．I'm sure the note was from the boy really．Poor thing！She'd be very pretty if she had some nice clothes．Do you think she'll mind if we offer to lend her a dress for Thursday？'</p>
<p>“她拿她母亲撒了个小小的谎，她的脸都红了。我敢肯定那封信其实是那个男孩写的。可怜的孩子！如果她有些好衣服，她会很漂亮的。你们觉得如果星期四晚会时我们借给她一件衣服她会介意吗？”</p>
<p>'I shall ask young Laurence to come，and we'll have some fun with her afterwards．'</p>
<p>“我会请小劳伦斯来，然后我们再跟她逗趣。”</p>
<p>Meg tried to forget what she'd heard，but could not．The gossip made her angry，and she was glad when the party was over and she was alone in her bed．She cried quietly to herself．Why did people have to say those things？She and Laurie were just friends，but now that friendship felt damaged by the unkind gossip．</p>
<p>麦格试图忘记她所听到的话，可是不行。那些闲言碎语使她很生气，所以晚会结束、她独自躺到床上时她很不高兴。她静静地哭了。人们为什么要那么说呢？她和罗瑞只是朋友，现在那份友谊像是要被那些不友好的闲话毁了。</p>
<p>The next day，Miss Belle said，'Meg，dear，we've sent an invitation to your friend，Mr Laurence，for Thursday．'</p>
<p>第二天，白拉小姐说：“麦格，亲爱的，我们给你的朋友劳伦斯先生发了份邀请，请他参加星期四的舞会。”</p>
<p>Meg pretended to misunderstand．'You're very kind，but I'm afraid he won't come．He's nearly seventy．'</p>
<p>麦格假装误会了：“你们真好，可我想他不会来的。他都快70岁了。”</p>
<p>Miss Belle laughed．'I mean the young man．'</p>
<p>白拉小姐笑了。“我是说那个年轻的先生。”</p>
<p>'There isn't one，'said Meg．'Laurie is only a boy．'</p>
<p>“没有年轻的先生，”麦格说，“劳瑞还是个孩子。”</p>
<p>'Isn't he about your age？'said Clara．</p>
<p>“他不是和你差不多大吗？”克拉拉问。</p>
<p>'Nearer Jo's，'said Meg．'I'm seventeen in August．'</p>
<p>“他离琼更近些。”麦格说。“我八月份就17岁了。”</p>
<p>'It's nice of him to send you flowers，'said Annie．</p>
<p>“他送你花真好，”安妮说。</p>
<p>'He often does，to all of us，'said Meg．'My mother and old Mr Laurence are friends，you know．'</p>
<p>“他经常这样，给我们大家都送，”麦格说。“你们知道，我妈妈和老劳伦斯先生是朋友。”</p>
<p>'What will you wear on Thursday？'asked Sallie．</p>
<p>“你星期四穿什么？”萨丽问。</p>
<p>'My white dress again，I haven't got any others．'</p>
<p>“还是我那件白衣服，我没有别的了。”</p>
<p>'No others？'said Sallie．'How funny—'</p>
<p>“没有别的衣服？”萨丽道，“这太有意思了——”</p>
<p>'I have a pretty blue dress I can't wear any more，Meg，'said Belle．'It will please me if you wear it．'</p>
<p>“我有一件很漂亮的蓝裙子，我穿不下了，麦格，”白拉说，“你如果穿上它我会很高兴。”</p>
<p>'You're very kind，but—，'began Meg．</p>
<p>“你太好了，可是——”麦格开始说。</p>
<p>'Please，do，'said Belle．'You'll look quite beautiful in it．'</p>
<p>“穿上吧，”白拉说。“你穿上会非常漂亮的。”</p>
<p>Meg couldn't refuse this kind offer and，on the Thursday evening，Belle helped to change Meg into a fine lady．She brushed and curled her hair，reddened her lips，then helped her to get into the sky-blue dress．The neck of the dress was cut very low，and Meg was quite shocked when she saw herself in the mirror．A necklace and earrings were added，and Meg was ready for the party．</p>
<p>麦格无法拒绝这份好心，星期四晚上，白丝帮忙把麦格变成了一个漂亮的淑女。她替她梳了头，卷了头发，上了唇色，然后帮她穿上那件天蓝色的衣裙。那件衣服的领子开得很低，当麦格从镜子里看到自己时，她感到十分震惊。戴上项链和耳环后，麦格就准备好参加舞会了。</p>
<p>At first，she felt strange in all the fine clothes，but she soon discovered that people who did not usually notice her now came to speak to her．Several young men who had only stared before now asked to be introduced．</p>
<p>刚开始，她穿着那些好衣服感觉很别扭，可不久她发现那些平常不注意她的人开始跟她攀谈了。几个年轻人原先只盯着她看，现在都希望被介绍给她。</p>
<p>Suddenly，Meg saw Laurie across the room．He was staring at her，and he didn't look very pleased．Meg began to feel uncomfortable，and she wished that she had worn her old dress．As she walked up to Laurie，she saw Belle and Annie watching them both and smiling．</p>
<p>突然，麦格看见了屋子那头的罗瑞。他正盯着她瞧，看上去不太高兴。麦格开始感到很不舒服，她希望她穿的是自己的旧衣服，她朝罗瑞走过去，她看见白拉和安妮看着他俩在笑。</p>
<p>'I'm glad you came，'Meg said to Laurie，in her most grown-up voice．'I was afraid you wouldn't．'</p>
<p>“我很高兴你来了，”麦格尽量用成熟的声音对罗瑞说，“我以为你不会来呢。”</p>
<p>'Jo wanted me to come and tell her how you looked，'said Laurie．</p>
<p>“琼让我来的，她让我告诉她你看上去怎么样，”罗瑞说。</p>
<p>'What will you tell her？'</p>
<p>“那你会怎样告诉她？”</p>
<p>'1'll say I didn't know you，because you look so unlike yourself．I'm quite afraid of you，'he said．</p>
<p>“我会告诉她我不认识你，因为你看上去不像你自己。我很怕你，”他说。</p>
<p>'The girls dressed me up for fun，'said Meg．'Don't you like it？'</p>
<p>“那些姑娘把我打扮成这样玩儿的，”麦格说，“你不喜欢吗？”</p>
<p>'No，I don't，'came the cool reply．</p>
<p>“不，我不喜欢，”回答是冷冷的。</p>
<p>Meg became angry．'Then I shan't stay with you！'And she walked off towards the window．</p>
<p>麦格感到很生气。“那我就不跟你在一起了！”她随后朝窗户走去。</p>
<p>A moment or two later，an older man went past her and she heard him say to his friend，'That girl has been dressed up like a doll．'</p>
<p>一两分钟之后，一个年长些的绅士从她身边走过，她听见他对他的朋友说：“那个女孩被打扮得像个玩具娃娃。”</p>
<p>'Oh dear，'thought Meg．'Why didn't I wear my own things？'</p>
<p>“噢，天哪，”麦格想，“我为什么不穿我自己的衣服？”</p>
<p>She turned and saw Laurie behind her．'Please forgive me，'he said．'Come and have something to eat．'</p>
<p>她转过身，看见罗瑞站在她身后。“请原谅我吧，”他说。“来吃点东西吧。”</p>
<p>Meg tried to look annoyed．</p>
<p>麦格尽力装做不开心。</p>
<p>'Please come，'he said again．'I don't like your dress，but I do think you are—wonderful．'</p>
<p>“来吧，”他又说，“我不喜欢你的衣服，可我确实觉得你——很出色。”</p>
<p>Meg smiled and found it impossible to stay angry with him．'Please don't tell them at home about my dress，'she said．'They won't understand that it was just for fun，and it will worry Mother．I was stupid to wear it，but I'll tell them myself．'</p>
<p>麦格笑了，她发现根本不可能跟他生气。“千万别告诉家里人我的衣服的事，”麦格说。“她们不会明白那只是为了好玩儿，妈妈会担心的。我穿这身衣服真是愚蠢，可我会亲自告诉她们。”</p>
<p>'I won't say anything，'he promised．</p>
<p>“我什么也不会说。”他发誓说。</p>
<p>He did not see her again until supper time，when she was drinking wine with two other boys．</p>
<p>他直到晚饭时才又见到她，她正在跟另外两个男孩喝葡萄酒。</p>
<p>'You'll feel ill tomorrow，if you drink much of that，Meg，'Laurie whispered to her．</p>
<p>“如果你喝得多了，你明天会难受的，麦格，”罗瑞轻声对她说。</p>
<p>'I'm not Meg tonight，'she said．'I'm a doll who does crazy things．Tomorrow，I'll be good again．'</p>
<p>“我今晚不是麦格，”她说。“我是一个做疯狂事的玩具娃娃。明天我就变好了。”</p>
<p>Meg danced and laughed and talked to as many young men as she could manage，but went to bed feeling that she hadn't enjoyed herself as much as she had expected．</p>
<p>麦格又跳又笑，尽可能地跟很多年轻绅士谈话，可她上床睡觉时并没像她期待的那样感觉玩得很开心。</p>
<p>She was sick all the next day， and on Saturday went home，quite tired of her fortnight's fun．</p>
<p>第二天她一整天觉得很不舒服。星期六她回家了，由于前一天的玩乐，她感到很累。</p>
<p>'I'm glad to be home，'she said to her mother and Jo，after telling them how she was dressed up like a doll，drank too much wine，and was ill afterwards．She had laughed while telling them the story，but her face still looked worried at the end．</p>
<p>“真高兴回家来，”当她向母亲和琼讲述了她怎样被打扮得像个玩具娃娃、怎样喝了太多的葡萄酒、后来感到难受的事后，她说。她在向她们讲她的故事时笑过，但最后她的表情还是显得忧虑。</p>
<p>'There is something else，I think，'said Mrs March，smoothing Meg' s cheek，which suddenly became rose-red．</p>
<p>“我觉得还有些别的事，”马奇太太边说边抚摸着麦格的脸颊。那张脸突然变得通红。</p>
<p>'Yes，'Meg said slowly．'I hate people saying and thinking awful things about us and Laurie．'Then she told them the gossip she had heard．</p>
<p>“是的，”麦格慢慢地说，“我讨厌人们说些和想些关于我们和罗瑞的坏话。”之后她向她们讲述了她听到的闲话。</p>
<p>'What rubbish！'said Jo．'Just wait until I see Annie Moffat！How stupid to think that Mother has “plans”，and that we are kind to Laurie because he is rich and may marry one of us one day．He'll laugh when I tell him！'</p>
<p>“废话！”琼说，“等我看见安妮&middot;墨菲时再说！这有多愚蠢，觉得妈妈早有'打算'，还认为我们对罗瑞好是因为他有钱，将来会跟我们其中的一个结婚。如果我告诉他他会笑坏了的！”</p>
<p>'No，Jo，'said her mother．'You must never repeat wicked gossip．</p>
<p>“不许，琼，”她母亲说，“你永远不许重复不好的闲话。”</p>
<p>'Do you have “plans”，Mother？'asked Meg．</p>
<p>“你早有'打算'吗，妈妈？”麦格问。</p>
<p>'All mothers do，dear，'said Mrs March．'But my plans are different from Mrs Moffat's，I suspect．I want my daughters to be loved，and I want people to think well of them．I want them to marry well，but not to marry rich men just because they are rich．I'd rather you were poor men's wives，if that meant you had happy，peaceful lives．But your father and I believe that we'll always be proud of our daughters，whether they are married or single．'</p>
<p>“所有的母亲都有打算的，亲爱的，”马奇太太说。“可我认为我的打算跟墨菲太太的有所不同。我要我的女儿们被爱，我要大家都喜欢她们。我要她们婚姻美满，可不是只为了富有而嫁给富人。如果你们成为穷人的妻子，可那意味着你们拥有幸福宁静的生活，我倒宁愿你们那样做。不过你们的父亲和我相信我们会永远为我们的女儿自豪，无论她们是单身还是已婚。”</p>
<p>'You will，you will！said Meg and Jo，together．</p>
<p>“你们会的，你们会的。”麦格和琼异口同声地说道。</p><a href='8.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
