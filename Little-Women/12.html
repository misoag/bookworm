<p><b>12 爱和布鲁克先生 </b></p>
<p>When Beth woke from her long sleep，she looked into her mother's face and smiled．Then she slept again，but Mrs March held on to her daughter's thin little hand．</p>
<p>当白丝从她的长觉中醒来，她望着母亲的脸，笑了。然后她又睡去了，可马奇太太依旧握着女儿瘦瘦的小手。</p>
<p>Hannah made breakfast while Meg and Jo listened as their mother told them about their father's health，and Mr Brooke's promise to stay with him．Then Meg and Jo closed their tired eyes and were able to rest at last．</p>
<p>海娜做早餐的时候，麦格和琼听她们的母亲讲述父亲的健康状况，她还说布鲁克先生答应和他呆在一起。然后麦格和琼合上了眼睛，终于能休息了。</p>
<p>Laurie went to give the good news to Amy at Aunt March's house． He， too， was tired after the long night， and just man-aged to finish telling his story before he fell asleep in the chair．Amy began to write a short letter to her mother， but before she could finish it， she saw Mrs March coming towards her aunt's house！Amy ran to meet her．</p>
<p>罗瑞去把好消息告诉在马奇姑妈家的艾米，经过那个长夜，他也太累了，刚一讲完他的故事，他就在椅子上睡着了。艾米开始给母亲写一封短信，可还没等写完，她就看见马奇太太正朝马奇姑妈家走来！艾米跑过去迎接她。</p>
<p>There were probably many happy little girls in the city that day，but Amy was the happiest of them all as she sat on her mother's knee．'I've been thinking a lot about Beth，'she said．'Everyone loves her because she isn't selfish．People wouldn't feel half so bad about me if I was sick， but I'd like to be loved and missed．I'm going to try and be like Beth as much as I can．'</p>
<p>那天城里大概有许多幸福的女孩，可当艾米坐在母亲的膝头上时，她就是她们中最幸福的一个。“我一直在惦念白丝，”她说。“每个人都喜欢她，因为她不自私。如果是我病了，大家一定不会有这个一半的感觉，可我希望被爱、被惦念。我一定努力像白丝那样。”</p>
<p>Her mother kissed her．'I'm sure you will succeed，'she said．'Now I must go back to Beth． Be patient， little daughter， and we'll soon have you home again．'That evening， while Meg was writing to her father， Jo went upstairs to Beth's room and found her mother beside the bed，as the little girl slept．</p>
<p>她的母亲吻了她。“我肯定你会成功的，”她说。“现在我得回到白丝那儿去。耐心点，小女儿，我们不久就让你回家。”那天晚上，在麦格给父亲写信的时候，琼走上楼，来到白丝的房间，她发现母亲正在床边，白丝睡着了。</p>
<p>'I want to tell you something， Mother，'said Jo．</p>
<p>“我想告诉你些事，妈妈，”琼说。</p>
<p>'Is it about Meg？'said Mrs March．</p>
<p>“是关于麦格的吧？”马奇太太问。</p>
<p>'How quickly you guessed！'said Jo．'Yes， it's about her．Last summer，Meg lost one of her gloves at the Laurences'picnic，and later Laurie told me that Mr Brooke had it，and kept it in his coat pocket． It fell out once， and Laurie saw it．Mr Brooke told Laurie that he liked Meg but was afraid to tell her because she was so young and he was so poor． Isn't it all awful？'</p>
<p>“你猜得真快！”琼说，“是的，是关于她。夏天，麦格在劳伦斯家的野餐会上丢了一只手套，后来罗瑞告诉我布鲁克先生拿了，把它放在他的外套口袋里。有一次它掉了出来，罗瑞看到了。布鲁克先生告诉罗瑞他喜欢麦格，却不敢告诉她，因为她太年轻而他又那么穷。这是不是很糟糕？”</p>
<p>'Do you think Meg likes and cares about him？'asked Mrs March，with a worried look．</p>
<p>“你觉得麦格喜欢他、在乎他吗？”马奇太太面带忧虑地问。</p>
<p>'I don t know anything about love！'said Jo．</p>
<p>“我对爱一无所知！”琼说。</p>
<p>'Do you think she's not in interested in John？'said Mrs March．</p>
<p>“你认为她对约翰不感兴趣？”马奇太太问。</p>
<p>'Who？'said Jo， staring．</p>
<p>“谁？”琼瞪着眼问。</p>
<p>'Mr Brooke，' said her mother．'I call him John because we became good friends at the hospital．'</p>
<p>“布鲁克先生，”她母亲说。“我管他叫约翰，因为我们在医院成了好朋友。”</p>
<p>'Oh，dear！' said Jo．'He's been good to Father， and nowyou'll let Meg marry him，if she wants to．'</p>
<p>“噢，天哪！”琼说。“他对爸爸好，现在你又让麦格嫁给他，如果她想的话。”</p>
<p>'My dear，don't be angry，' said Mrs March．'John told us quite honestly that he loved Meg， but said he would earn enough money for a comfortable home before he asked her to marry him． He wants very much to make her love him if hecan．He's an excellent young man，but your father and I will not agree to Meg marrying before she is twenty．'</p>
<p>“我亲爱的，别生气，”马奇太太说。“约翰非常诚恳地告诉我们说他爱麦格，可他说他要等到赚了足够的钱建一个舒适的家时才向麦格求婚。他非常想尽他所能让她爱他。他是个很出色的人，可你爸爸和我在麦格20岁之前不会同意她结婚。”</p>
<p>'I want her to marry Laurie， and be rich，' said Jo．'I'm afraid Laurie isn't grown-up enough for Meg，' said Mrs March．'Don't make plans， Jo．Let time and their own hearts bring your friends together．'</p>
<p>“我要让他嫁给罗瑞，变得富有，”琼说。“恐怕罗瑞对麦格来说还没长大，”马奇太太说。“别做任何打算，琼。让时间和他们自己的心把你的朋友们带到一起。”</p>
<p>Meg came in with the letter for her father．</p>
<p>麦格走进来，手里拿着给她父亲的信。</p>
<p>'Beautifully written，my dear，'said her mother，looking at the letter．'Please add that I send my love to John．''Do you call him John？'said Meg，smiling．</p>
<p>“写得很棒，亲爱的，”她母亲看着信说。“请加上我带给约翰我的爱。”“你管他叫约翰吗？”麦格笑着问。</p>
<p>'Yes， he's been like a son to us and we are very fond ofhim，'said Mrs March，watching her daughter closely．</p>
<p>“是的，他就像个儿子那样对我们，我们都很喜欢他，”马奇太太说，同时仔细地观察着女儿。</p>
<p>'I'm glad of that， because he's so lonely，'was Meg's qui-et answer．'Goodnight，Mother dear．'</p>
<p>“我很高兴是那样，因为他太孤单了。”麦格很安静地答道。“晚安，亲爱的妈妈。”</p>
<p>Mrs March kissed her gently．'She does not love John yet，'she thought，'but she will soon learn to．'</p>
<p>马奇太太温柔地吻了她。“她还不爱约翰，”她想，“可她很快就会学会的。”</p><a href='13.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
