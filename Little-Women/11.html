<p><b>11 白丝 </b></p>
<p>Ten days after their mother went away，Beth came home late after one of several visits to a sick baby at the Hummels'house．She went straight to her mother's room and shut herself inside．Half an hour later，Jo found her sitting there，looking very ill．</p>
<p>母亲离开10天以后，白丝很晚才回家，她已几次去哈梅尔家看望一个生病的婴儿。她径直走进母亲的房间，把自己关在里面。半个小时以后，琼发现她坐在那儿，看上去病得很厉害。</p>
<p>'Beth，what's the matter？'cried Jo．</p>
<p>“白丝，怎么了？”琼叫道。</p>
<p>Beth put out a hand to keep her away．'You've had scarlet fever，haven't you？she said．</p>
<p>白丝伸出一支手，让她离远点。“你得过猩红热，是不是？”她说。</p>
<p>'Years ago，when Meg did，'said Jo．'Why？'</p>
<p>“几年以前得过，那是麦格得病时传染了我，”琼说，“怎么了？”</p>
<p>'Oh，Jo！Mrs Hummel's baby is dead，'said Beth．'It died in my arms before Mrs Hummel got home．'</p>
<p>“噢，琼！哈梅尔的婴儿死了，”白丝说，“它在哈梅尔太太回家前死在我怀里。”</p>
<p>'My poor Beth，how awful for you！'said Jo，putting an arm around her sister．'What did you do？'</p>
<p>“我可怜的白丝，这对你太糟了！”琼说，用一只胳膊搂住她的妹妹。“你做了什么？”</p>
<p>'I just sat and held it until Mrs Hummel came with the doctor．He looked at Heinrich and Minna who were also feeling sick．“It's scarlet fever，”he said．Then he told me to come home and take some medicine quickly or I would catch it，too．'</p>
<p>“我就那么坐在那儿抱着它，直到哈梅尔太太带着医生来。他看看海因里奇和米娜，他们也觉得不舒服。'是猩红热，'他说。然后他告诉我回家来赶快吃点药，要不然我也会得病的。”</p>
<p>'I'll fetch Hannah，'said Jo．</p>
<p>“我去找海娜，”琼说。</p>
<p>'Don't let Amy come，'said Beth．'She hasn't had it，and I don't want to give it to her．'</p>
<p>“别让艾米来，”白丝说。“她没得过，我不想传染给她。”</p>
<p>It was decided that Amy must go to Aunt March's house，so Laurie took her there．Poor Amy did not like this plan at all and only agreed to go when Laurie said he would visit her every day to bring her news of Beth．</p>
<p>大家决定艾米必须去马奇姑妈家，于是罗瑞把她带到那儿。可怜的艾米一点也不喜欢这个主意，直到罗瑞说他每天都会会看她，带给她白丝的消息，她才同意去。</p>
<p>When Laurie got back，he asked Jo and Meg if he ought to send a telegram to Mrs March．</p>
<p>罗瑞回来的时候，问琼和麦格他是不是应该给马奇太太发封电报。</p>
<p>'Hannah says Mother can't leave Father and would only worry，'said Meg．'She says Beth won't be sick long，and that she knows what to do，but it doesn't seem right．'</p>
<p>“海娜说妈妈不能离开爸爸，只会为这事着急担心，”麦格说。“她说白丝不会病很久，她知道该怎么做，可这好像不对。”</p>
<p>Mr Laurence was not allowed to see Beth，and Meg felt unhappy writing letters to her mother saying nothing about Beth's illness．Jo nursed Beth night and day，but the time came when Beth did not know her and called for her mother．Jo was frightened，and Meg begged to be allowed to write the truth，but Hannah said there was no danger yet．Then a letter came saying that Mr March was worse and could not think of coming home for a long time．</p>
<p>他们不准劳伦斯先生来看望白丝。麦格为给妈妈的信中不能提白丝的病感到很不高兴。琼日夜照看白丝，可不久白丝不认识她了，喊叫着要母亲。琼害怕了，麦格恳求允许她把真情写在信里，可海娜说还不会有危险。之后来了一封信，说马奇先生病情加重，在很长一段时间内她还不能考虑回家。</p>
<p>How dark the days seemed．How sad and lonely The sisters worked and waited as the shadow of death lay over the once happy home．It was then that Meg realized how rich she had been in the things which really mattered—love，peace，good health．And Jo，watching her little sister，thought about how unselfish Beth always was—living for others and trying to make home a happy place for all who came there．Amy，sad and lonely at Aunt March's house，just wanted to come home so that she could do something to help Beth．</p>
<p>那些日子看起来多阴暗哪。那么悲伤和孤独，女孩子们工作着，等待着死亡的阴影笼罩着这个一度欢乐的家。就在那时，麦格意识到她曾经多么富有，那些东西才是真正应该在意的——爱，和平，健康。琼看着她的妹妹，想起白丝一直是那么无私——为别人而生活，努力为来到家里的人把家变成一个快乐的地方。艾米在马奇姑妈家又伤心又孤单，只想回家为白丝帮点忙。</p>
<p>On the first day of December，the doctor came in the morning．He looked at Beth，then said quietly，'If Mrs March can leave her husband，I think she should come home now．'</p>
<p>12月的第一天，医生一早就来了。他看了看白丝，然后缓缓地说：“如果马奇太太能离开她的丈夫，我认为她现在就应该回家来。”</p>
<p>Jo threw on her coat and ran out into the snow to send a telegram．When she arrived back，Laurie came with a letter saying that Mr March was getting better again．This was good news，but Jo's face was so unhappy that Laurie asked， What is it？Is Beth worse？</p>
<p>琼穿上外衣跑到外面的雪地里，去发电报。当她回来时，罗瑞带来一封信，说马奇先生又有好转了。这是好消息，可琼的脸上看上去是那么不开心，于是罗瑞问：“怎么了？是不是白丝病重了？”</p>
<p>'I've sent for Mother，'said Jo，beginning to cry．'Beth doesn't know us any more．'</p>
<p>“我已经叫妈妈回来了，”琼说道，开始哭泣起来，“白丝已经不认识我们了。”</p>
<p>Laurie held her hand and whispered，'I'm here，Jo．Hold on to me．Your mother will be here soon，and then everything will be all right．'</p>
<p>罗瑞握住她的手，小声说：“我在这儿，琼。有我呢。你妈妈就会回来了，然后所有的事都会好了。”</p>
<p>'I'm glad Father is better，'said Jo．'Now Mother won't feel so bad about coming home．'</p>
<p>“我很高兴爸爸好些了，”琼说。“现在妈妈回家里心情也不会很糟。”</p>
<p>'You're very tired，'said Laurie．'But I'll tell you something to cheer you up better than anything．'</p>
<p>“你很累了，”罗瑞说。“可我要告诉你一些事使你高兴起来。”</p>
<p>'What is it？'said Jo．</p>
<p>“是什么？”琼问。</p>
<p>Laurie smiled．'I sent a telegram to your mother yesterday，and Mr Brooke answered that she'd come at once．She'll be here tonight and everything will be all right！'</p>
<p>罗瑞笑了。“我昨天就已发了一封电报给你妈妈，布鲁克先生说她会马上回来。她今天晚上就会回来，一切都会好的！”</p>
<p>Jo threw her arms around him．'Oh，Laurie！Oh，Mother！I am so glad！'She did not cry again，but held on to her friend．He was surprised，but he smoothed her hair and followed this with a kiss or two．</p>
<p>琼用双臂搂住他。“噢，罗瑞！噢，妈妈！我太高兴了！”她不再哭了，可还是搂着罗瑞。他很吃惊，可他理了理她的头发，然后吻了她一两下。</p>
<p>Jo pushed him gently away．'Oh，don't！I didn't mean—！'</p>
<p>琼轻轻把他推开。“噢，别这样，我并不是说想——！”</p>
<p>'I enjoyed it！'laughed Laurie，then，went on，'Grandfather and I thought your mother ought to know．She wouldn't forgive us if Beth—well，if anything happened．Her train will be in at two o'clock in the morning，and I'll meet her．'</p>
<p>“我很喜欢！”罗瑞笑了，然后继续说，“祖父和我认为你母亲应该知道。万一白丝——哦，如果发生什么事，她不会饶恕我们的。她乘坐的火车早晨两点到，我去接她。”</p>
<p>All that day，the snow fell and the hours went slowly by．The doctor came，then said he would come back after midnight when he expected there to be some change in Beth's condition，for better or worse．Hannah fell asleep in a chair beside Beth's bed．Mr Laurence waited downstairs，while Laurie lay on the floor pretending to rest．The girls just waited，unable to sleep．</p>
<p>那一整天，下着雪，时间缓慢地过去。医生来了，然后说他午夜以后再来，那时白丝的情况会有变化，变好或变坏。海娜坐在白丝床边的椅子上睡着了。劳伦斯先生等在楼下，罗瑞躺在地上权当休息。女孩子们只有等待，她们睡不着。</p>
<p>At twelve o'clock，a change seemed to pass over Beth's face．Hannah slept on，but the girls saw the shadow which seemed to fall upon the little bed．An hour went by and Laurie left quietly for the station．</p>
<p>12点钟，似乎白丝脸上有了变化。海娜继续睡着，可女孩子们却似乎看到降临到那张小床上的阴影。一小时过去了，罗瑞离开去了车站。</p>
<p>At two o'clock，Jo was standing at the window，watching the snow．She heard something and turned to see Meg kneeling beside her mother's chair．A cold feeling of fear passed over Jo．'Beth is dead，'she thought．</p>
<p>两点钟，琼站在窗边看雪。她听到了一点声音，转过身来看见麦格跪在妈妈的椅子旁边。一种冰冷的恐惧感传遍琼的全身。“白丝死了，”她想。</p>
<p>She ran to the bed．The pain had gone from Beth's face，and now there was a look of peace instead．Jo kissed her and softly whispered，'Goodbye，Beth，goodbye！'</p>
<p>她朝床跑过去。痛苦已从白丝脸上消失，取而代之的是一种安详的表情。琼吻了吻她，轻柔地低语：“再见，白丝，再见！”</p>
<p>Hannah woke up and looked at Beth．'The fever's gone！'she cried．'She's sleeping and breathing easily！'</p>
<p>海娜醒了过来，看了看白丝。“热退了！”她喊道，“她睡着了，呼吸很顺畅！”</p>
<p>The doctor came soon after．'I think she'll be all right，'he said．'Keep the house quiet and let her sleep．'</p>
<p>医生不久就来了。“我想她会好的，”他说。“让这房子保持安静，叫她睡觉。”</p>
<p>Meg and Jo held each other close，their hearts too full for words．Beth was lying as she used to，with her cheek on her hand，and breathing quietly．</p>
<p>麦格和琼紧紧地拥抱，她们的心情难以言表。白丝就像她从前一样躺着，手托着脸颊，平静地呼吸着。</p>
<p>'I wish Mother would come now，'whispered Jo．</p>
<p>“我希望妈妈能现在就回来，”琼低声说。</p>
<p>And a moment later，they heard the sound of the door below，a cry from Hannah，then Laurie's happy voice saying，'Girls，she's come！She's come！'</p>
<p>片刻之后，他们听到了楼下的门声，海娜喊了一声，然后是罗瑞快乐的声音说：“女孩们，她来了，她来了！”</p><a href='12.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
