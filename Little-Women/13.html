<p><b>13 罗瑞惹麻烦琼平息事端 </b></p>
<p>Laurie quickly realized that Jo was keeping a secret which she refused to tell him,but he guessed the secret was about Meg and Mr Brooke, and was annoyed that his tutor had said nothing.He began to make some private plans of his own.</p>
<p>罗瑞很快意识到，琼有秘密在瞒着他，她拒绝向他透露，可他猜想那秘密是关于麦格和布鲁克先生的。他也因老师什么都不说而感到有些生气。他开始制定他自己的计划。</p>
<p>Meg,meanwhile,was busy getting things ready for her father's return, but a change suddenly seemed to come over her.For a day or two,she jumped when she was spoken to,and there was a worried look on her face.</p>
<p>与此同时，麦格忙着为父亲的归来做准备，可是她似乎突然有了某种变化。有一两天，一有人跟她说话她就跳起来，脸上带着焦虑的神色。</p>
<p>Then a letter arrived for her, and a few minutes later Mrs March and Jo saw Meg staring at it with a frightened face.'My child,what is it?'said Mrs March.</p>
<p>然后有封给她的信，几分钟以后马奇太太和琼看见麦格眼盯着那封信，面露惧色。“我的孩子，那是什么？”马奇太太问。</p>
<p>'It's a mistake-he didn't send it.Jo, how could you do it?'Meg hid her face in her hands and cried.</p>
<p>“是个误会——他没发那封信。琼，你怎么能那样做？”麦格用手捂住脸哭了。</p>
<p>'Me?I've done nothing,'said Jo.'What's she talking about?'</p>
<p>“我？我什么也没做呀，”琼说，“她在说什么？”</p>
<p>Meg pulled another letter from her pocket and threw it at Jo.'You wrote it, and that bad boy helped you. How could you be so cruel and mean to us both?'</p>
<p>麦格从她口袋里抽出另一封信扔给琼。“是你写的，那个坏男孩帮了你。你们怎么能这么无情，对我们俩这么坏？”</p>
<p>Jo and her mother read the letter which had been in Meg's pocket.</p>
<p>琼和母亲读了那封装在麦格口袋里的信。</p>
<p>My dearest Meg,I can no longer hide my love for you,and must know your answer before I return.I cannot tellyour parents yet, but I think they will agree if they know that we love one another.Mr Laurence will help me find a good job,and then, my sweet girl, you will make me happy.Say nothing to your family yet, but send a word of hope tome through Laurie.Your loving John.</p>
<p>我最亲爱的麦格，我再也不能隐瞒对你的爱，在我回来之前我一定要得到你的答覆。我还不能告诉你的父母，可我想如果他们知道我们相爱的话他们是会同意的。劳伦斯先生会帮我找一份好工作，然后，我心爱的姑娘，你会让我幸福的。先不要对你父母讲，但通过罗瑞给我一句希望的话吧。爱你的约翰。</p>
<p>'That terrible boy!'said Jo.'I'll make him sorry.'</p>
<p>“那个可恶的男孩！”琼说，“我会让他后悔的。”</p>
<p>But her mother said,'Wait,Jo.Are you sure this is nothing to do with you?'</p>
<p>可她母亲说：“等等，琼。你肯定这事与你无关吗？”</p>
<p>'I never saw the letter before!'said Jo.'But Mr Brooke wouldn't write stupid things like that.'</p>
<p>“我以前从来也没见过这封信！”琼说。“可布鲁克先生不会说像这样的蠢话。”</p>
<p>'It's like his writing,'said Meg unhappily, looking at the second letter in her hand.</p>
<p>“这像他的笔迹，”麦格看着她手上的第二封信。”</p>
<p>'Oh,Meg,you didn't answer it?'said Mrs March.</p>
<p>“噢，麦格，你没回这封信吧？”马奇太太问。</p>
<p>'Yes,I did!'cried Meg,hiding her face again.</p>
<p>“不，我回了！”麦格哭着说，又把头埋进双手里。</p>
<p>'Let me get that wicked boy!'shouted Jo.</p>
<p>“让我抓住那个坏男孩！”琼大喊。</p>
<p>Mrs March sat beside Meg.'Tell me everything.'</p>
<p>马奇太太坐在麦格耳边：“把一切都告诉我。”</p>
<p>'Laurie brought the first letter,'said Meg. 'He didn't seem to know anything about it. I was going to tell you, but I remembered how you liked Mr Brooke and thought it would be all right to keep my little secret for a while.Now I can never look him in the face again.'</p>
<p>“罗瑞带来了第一封信，”麦格说，“他看上去什么都不知道。我本来想告诉你，可我记得你是那么喜欢布鲁克先生，就想，让我自己把这个小秘密保守一段时间也没关系。现在我再也不能面对他了。”</p>
<p>'What did you write to him?'asked Mrs March.</p>
<p>“你给他写了什么？”马奇太太问。</p>
<p>'I only said that I was too young to do anything,and that I didn't wish to have secrets from you so he must speak to Father.I thanked him for his kindness and said I would be his friend,but nothing more,for a long time.'Mrs March smiled and looked pleased.</p>
<p>“我说我太年轻了，什么都不能做。我说我不希望对你保守秘密，所以他必须要对爸爸讲。我感谢他的好意，说我会成为他的朋友，但在很长时期内不会有更进一步的关系。”马奇太太笑了，看上去很高兴。</p>
<p>Jo laughed.'What did he reply to that?'</p>
<p>琼笑了。“他怎么答覆的？”</p>
<p>'He writes here that he never sent any love letter, and is sorry that my sister Jo should play games with us like this,'said Meg.'It's a very kind letter, but imagine how awful I feel.'</p>
<p>“他在这儿写道，他从没发过什么情书，说他因为我妹妹琼对我们俩做游戏感到很遗憾，”麦格说，“这是一封好心的信，可想想看我感觉有多糟糕。”</p>
<p>'I don't believe Brooke saw either of those letters,'said Jo.'Laurie wrote them both and he's keeping yours because I won't tell him my secret.'</p>
<p>“我不相信布鲁克先生看见过这两封信的任何一封，”琼说。“两封都是罗瑞写的，他把你的信留下了，因为我不告诉他我的秘密。”</p>
<p>'Go and fetch Laurie,Jo,'said Mrs March.'I'll put a stop to all this at once.'</p>
<p>“去把罗瑞找来，琼，”马奇太太说，“我要这一切立刻停下来。”</p>
<p>Away ran Jo,and Mrs March gently told Meg Mr Brooke's real feelings.'Now,dear, do you love him enough to wait until he can make a home for you?'</p>
<p>琼跑了，马奇太太轻柔地给麦格讲了布鲁克先生的真实感觉。“现在，亲爱的，你爱他足以到愿意等他给你建个家吗？”</p>
<p>'I'm frightened and worried,'answered Meg.'I don't want anything to do with love for a long time-perhaps never.If John doesn't know about all this, don't tell him, and please make Jo and Laurie keep quiet.'</p>
<p>“我又害怕又担心，”麦格答道。“我在很长时间内也不想让任何事与爱有关——也许永远不想。如果约翰不知道这些，就别告诉他，请让琼和罗瑞也别说出去。”</p>
<p>Mrs March tried to calm her daughter, but as soon as Meg heard Laurie coming back with Jo, she ran out of the room,and Mrs March saw the boy alone. When Laurie saw Mrs March's angry face,he guessed the reason.Jo waited outside the room as,inside,the voices rose and fell for half an hour.But the girls never knew what was said.</p>
<p>马奇太太尽力安慰女儿，可当麦格一听到罗瑞正和琼回来，她就跑出了房间，马奇太太单独见了那男孩。罗瑞一看到马奇太太愤怒的面容，他就猜到了原因。琼在房间外面等着，只听里面的声音高一声低一声地持续了半个小时。可女孩们并不知道都说了些什么。</p>
<p>When they were called in,Laurie apologized to Meg,and told her that Mr Brooke knew nothing about either of the two letters.'Please forgive me,Meg,'he said.</p>
<p>当她们被叫进去以后，罗瑞向麦格道了歉，告诉她布鲁克先生根本不知道那两封信的事。“请饶恕我，麦格，”他说。</p>
<p>'I'll try,'said Meg,'but I didn't think you could be so unkind.'</p>
<p>“我会试试，”麦格说，“可我没想到你会那么不友好。”</p>
<p>Laurie looked so sorry that Jo wanted to forgive him straight away,but she said nothing and refused even to look at him.When he went away,looking hurt and unhappy,Jo wished she had been more forgiving.She could never stay angry for long,so after a while she hurried over to the big house,taking with her as an excuse one of Mr Laurence's books that she had borrowed.</p>
<p>罗瑞看上去非常后悔，琼很想直接就饶恕他，可她什么话也没说，甚至拒绝看他。当他离开时，他看上去受到了伤害，并且非常不开心，琼希望自己更仁慈一些。她从来不会生很长时间的气，于是过了会儿她就借口借过劳伦斯先生一本书，急匆匆赶到那座大房子里去。</p>
<p>'Is Mr Laurence in?'Jo asked a servant.</p>
<p>“劳伦斯先生在吗？”琼问一个仆人道。</p>
<p>'Yes,miss, but you can't see him,'said the servant.'Why?Is he ill?'said Jo.</p>
<p>“是的，小姐，可你不能见他，”仆人说。“为什么？他病了吗？”琼说。</p>
<p>'No,miss,but he's been arguing with Mr Laurie.''Where's Laurie?'said Jo.</p>
<p>“不是，小姐，可他刚跟罗瑞生过气。”“罗瑞在哪儿？”琼问。</p>
<p>'He's shut in his room,and he won't come out.''I'll go and see what's the matter,'said Jo.'I'm not afraid of either of them.'</p>
<p>“他关在自己房间里不出来。”“我要去看看是怎么回事，”琼说，“他们俩我谁也不怕。”</p>
<p>She went upstairs and knocked on Laurie's door.</p>
<p>他走上楼敲了敲罗瑞的门。</p>
<p>'Stop that!' shouted Laurie.</p>
<p>“别敲了！”罗瑞喊道。</p>
<p>Jo immediately knocked again and the door flew open.She stepped inside before Laurie could stop her.'I've come to say that I forgive you,'she said,'and I won't stay angry with you.'</p>
<p>琼马上又敲，门一下子开了。没等罗瑞制止她，她就迈进了房间。“我来向你说我原谅你了，”她说，“我不生你的气了。”</p>
<p>'Oh,'said Laurie.'Thank you.'</p>
<p>“噢，”罗瑞说。“谢谢你。”</p>
<p>'What's wrong?'she said, seeing his unhappy face.'I wouldn't tell Grandfather why your mother wanted to see me, because I promised her not to tell anyone,' he said.'But then Grandfather tried to shake the truth out of me,so I came up here and shut myself in.'</p>
<p>“怎么了？”她问。她发觉了他不高兴的神色。“我不告诉祖父你母亲为什么叫我去，因为我答应她不告诉任何人，”他说，“可是祖父摇晃我，非要知道真相不可，我就跑上来把自己关起来了。”</p>
<p>'I expect he's sorry he did that,'said Jo.'Go down and say you're sorry.I'll help you.'</p>
<p>“我想他后悔那么干了，”琼说。“下楼去说你很抱歉。我会帮你的。”</p>
<p>'No,I won't!'said Laurie angrily.'I was sorry about Meg,and I asked her to forgive me,but I won't do it again when I'm not the one who is wrong.He ought to believe me when I say I can't tell him something.I don't like being shaken like that,and I won't go down until he apologizes.'</p>
<p>“不，我不！”罗瑞生气地说，“我的确对麦格很抱歉，我请她饶恕我，可如果不是我做错了事，我就不会再道歉。当我告诉他我不能说出一些事时他应该相信我。我不喜欢被那样摇晃，如果他不道歉我就不下楼。”</p>
<p>'Listen,if I get your grandfather to apologize for shaking you,will you go down?'said Jo.</p>
<p>“听着，如果我让你祖父为摇晃了你而道歉，你会下楼吗？”琼问道。</p>
<p>'Yes, but you won't do it,'answered Laurie.</p>
<p>“是的，可你做不到，”罗瑞答道。</p>
<p>'If I can manage the young one,then I can manage the old one,'Jo said to herself as she went downstairs.</p>
<p>“如果我能制服小的，我就能制服老的，”下楼的时候琼自言自语。</p>
<p>'Come in!'said Mr Laurence, when she knocked on his door.</p>
<p>“进来！”当她敲门时，劳伦斯先生说。</p>
<p>'It's me, sir,' said Jo.'I'm returning a book.''Do you want any more?'said the old man, looking annoyed but trying not to show it.</p>
<p>“是我，先生，”琼说，“我来还一本书。”“你还要吗？”老先生说，他看上去有些生气，但尽力不显露出来。</p>
<p>'Yes,please,'said Jo.And she pretended to look for an-other book while Mr Laurence stared at her crossly.</p>
<p>“是的，”琼说。当劳伦斯先生生气地盯着她时她假装在找另一本书。</p>
<p>'What's that boy been doing?'he asked suddenly.'He won't tell me.'</p>
<p>“那孩子干了什么？”他突然问。“他不告诉我。”</p>
<p>'He did do something wrong and we forgave him,'said Jo,'but we all promised not to say a word to anyone.''He must not hide behind a promise from you soft-hearted girls,'said the old gentleman.'Tell me,Jo.'</p>
<p>“他确实做了件错事，我们原谅了他，”琼说，“可我们都发誓不把这件事对任何人讲。”“他不能因为答应了你们这些心软的女孩子而隐瞒真相，”老先生说。“告诉我，琼。”</p>
<p>'I can't,sir, because Mother has ordered me not to,'said Jo.'And if I tell you,it will make trouble for someone else,not Laurie.'</p>
<p>“我不能，先生，因为妈妈命令我不准说，”琼说。“如果我告诉了你，就会给别的人带来麻烦，而不是罗瑞。”</p>
<p>This seemed to calm the old man.'Then I'll forgive him,'he said after a moment.'He's a difficult boy and hard to manage,you know.'</p>
<p>这话看起来让老人放心了。“那我就原谅他，”他过了片刻说道，“他是个很难缠的孩子，很难驾驭，你知道的。”</p>
<p>'So am I,'said Jo,'but a kind word always helps.'</p>
<p>“我也是，”琼说。“可一句好话总是会有帮助的。”</p>
<p>'You think I'm not kind to him?'he said sharply.</p>
<p>“你认为我对他不好吗？”他尖刻地说。</p>
<p>'Too kind,very often,'said Jo,a little afraid,'but just a bit quick to be angry with him sometimes.'</p>
<p>“常常是太好了，”琼说，她有点害怕，“可有时太容易跟他生气。”</p>
<p>The old gentleman looked a little ashamed.'You're right, I am.Although I love the boy, I find it hard to be patient with him sometimes.Bring him down and tell him it's all right. I'm sorry I shook him.'</p>
<p>老先生看上去有点羞愧。“你是对的。我是那样。虽然我爱那孩子，可有时我发现很难对他有耐心。把他带下来，告诉他没事了，我很抱歉摇晃了他。”</p>
<p>'Why not write him an apology,sir?'said Jo.'He says he won't come down until he's got one.'</p>
<p>“为什么不给他写个条子道歉呢，先生？”琼说。“他说只有收到了道歉信他才会下来。”</p>
<p>Mr Laurence gave her another sharp look,but then smiled and put on his glasses.'Here, give me a bit of paper,' he said.</p>
<p>劳伦斯先生又尖刻地看了她一眼，可然后就笑了，戴上了他的眼镜。“来，给我张纸，”他说。</p>
<p>The words were written and Jo kissed the old man's cheek.Then she went upstairs and put the letter under Laurie's door.But he came out before she was gone.</p>
<p>纸条写好了，琼吻了老人的脸颊，然后她跑上楼把信放到罗瑞的门下。可他还没等她走开就出来了。</p>
<p>'Well done,Jo,'he said.'Did he shout at you?'</p>
<p>“干得好，琼，”他说。“他对你叫嚷了吗？”</p>
<p>'No,he was quite calm,'said Jo.'Now, go and eat your dinner.You'll both feel better after it.'</p>
<p>“不，他很平静，”琼说。“现在去吃饭吧。然后你们俩都会感觉好些。”</p>
<p>Everyone thought the matter was ended,but although others forgot it,Meg remembered.She never talked about Laurie's tutor but she thought of him often and dreamed her dreams.And once,when Jo was looking for something in her sister's desk,she found a bit of paper with'Mrs John Brooke written on it over and over again.</p>
<p>每个人都认为这件事情已经结束了，可虽然其他人都忘了，麦格还记得。她从不谈起罗瑞的老师，可她常想起他，做她自己的梦。有一次，琼到她姐姐桌子里找东西，她发现一小张纸上一遍一遍地写着“约翰&middot;布鲁克太太”。</p>
<p>'Oh, dear!'said Jo.</p>
<p>“噢，天哪！”琼说。</p><a href='14.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
