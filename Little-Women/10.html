<p><b>10 一封电报 </b></p>
<p>Mrs March，the girls and Laurie were sitting together on a dull November afternoon when Hannah hurried into the room with a telegram Mrs March read it，then dropped it to the floor，her face white and her hands shaking．Jo picked up the telegram and read it to the others in a frightened voice．Mrs March：Your husband is very ill．Come at once．S．Hale，Blank Hospital，Washington．</p>
<p>11月一个多云的下午，马奇太太、女孩子们和罗瑞正围坐在一起，海娜拿着一封电报匆匆走进屋来。马奇太太读了电报，然后把它掉落在地上，脸色煞白，双手颤抖。琼把电报拾起来，用惊恐的声音读给其他人听。“马奇太太，你的丈夫病得很重。马上来。华盛顿圣黑尔布兰克医院。”</p>
<p>The girls moved close to their mother．All their happiness had disappeared in a moment．</p>
<p>女孩子们靠近母亲。她们的快乐刹时消失了。</p>
<p>'I shall go at once，'said Mrs March，'but it may be too late．Oh，my children！'</p>
<p>“我得马上去，”马奇太太说，“可也许太迟了。噢，孩子们！”</p>
<p>For several minutes，there was only the sound of crying，then Hannah hurried away to get things ready for the long journey．</p>
<p>几分钟之内，只有啼哭的声音，然后海娜赶快去为这漫长的旅程收拾行装。</p>
<p>'Where's Laurie？'Mrs March asked．</p>
<p>“罗瑞在哪？”马奇太太问。</p>
<p>'Here，'said the boy．'Oh，let me do something！'</p>
<p>“在这儿，”那男孩说，“噢，让我做点事吧！”</p>
<p>'Send a telegram and say that I'll come at once，'said Mrs March．'The next train goes early in the morning． Now，I must write a note to Aunt March Jo，give me that pen and paper．</p>
<p>“去发封电报说我马上就来，”马奇太太说。“下一班火车清晨开出。现在我得给马奇姑妈写个便条。琼，给我拿支笔，还有纸。”</p>
<p>Jo knew that the money for the journey must be borrowed from Aunt March，and she too wanted to do something—anything—to help her father．</p>
<p>琼知道这次旅行的钱一定得从马奇姑妈那儿借，她也想为帮她父亲做些事，任何事都行。</p>
<p>Laurie went off to take the note to Aunt March and to send the telegram．Jo went to fetch some things from the shops，and Amy and Meg helped their mother to get ready．</p>
<p>罗瑞走了，去给马奇姑妈送条子和发电报。琼去商店买东西，艾米和麦格帮母亲做准备。</p>
<p>'Father will need good food and wine to help him get better，and there won't be much at the hospital，'said Mrs March．'Beth，go and ask Mr Laurence for a couple of bottles of wine．I'm not too proud to beg for Father．'</p>
<p>“爸爸一定需要好的食品和酒帮他恢复健康，医院里肯定不会有什么，”马奇太太说。“白丝，去向劳伦斯先生要几瓶酒。我可没有傲气到不能为你们父亲乞讨的地步。”</p>
<p>Mr Laurence came back with Beth．He offered to go with Mrs March，but she wouldn't let the old gentleman make the long，tiring journey，although he could see that she would like to have somebody with her．He went away again，saying，'I'll be back．</p>
<p>劳伦斯先生和白丝一起回来了。他表示要和马奇太太一起去，可她不让老先生做那么漫长疲劳的旅行，虽然他看得出她希望能有人陪她一起去。他再一次走开，说着：“我就回来。”</p>
<p>Soon after，Meg saw Mr Brooke by the door．</p>
<p>一会儿工夫，麦格看见布鲁克先生站在门口。</p>
<p>'I'm very sorry to hear your news，Miss March，'he said gently．'Mr Laurence and I think it will be a good idea if I travel with your mother．'</p>
<p>“我听到你们的消息感到很难过，马奇小姐，”他轻柔地说，“劳伦斯先生和我都觉得，如果让我和你母亲一起去会是个好主意。”</p>
<p>'How kind you all are！'said Meg．'It will be so good to know that there is someone to take care of Mother．Thank you very much！'She put out her hand and smiled gratefully up into his warm brown eyes．</p>
<p>“你真好！”麦格说，“能有个人照顾母亲简直太好了！非常感谢！”她伸出手，望着他那温和的棕色眼睛，感激地笑了。</p>
<p>Laurie came back with a letter and money from Aunt March，but Jo did not return．It was late afternoon when she came walking in and gave her mother some money．</p>
<p>罗瑞回来了，带来一封信和马奇姑妈的钱，可琼还没回来。下午很晚的时候，她回来了，交给母亲一些钱。</p>
<p>'That's to help make Father comfortable and to bring him home，'she said．</p>
<p>“把这钱拿去让爸爸感到舒适些，再把他带回家来。”她说。</p>
<p>'Twenty-five dollars！'said Mrs March．'My dear，where did you get it？'</p>
<p>“二十五块钱！”马奇太太说，“我亲爱的，你从哪儿弄来的？”</p>
<p>Jo took off her hat．</p>
<p>琼把帽子摘了下来。</p>
<p>'Your hair，your beautiful hair！'cried Amy．</p>
<p>“你的头发！你漂亮的头发！”艾米喊道。</p>
<p>All Jo's lovely，thick，long hair was cut short．</p>
<p>琼那一头漂亮的、又浓密又长的头发不见了。</p>
<p>'Jo，how could you？'cried Meg．</p>
<p>“琼，你怎么能这样做？”麦格叫道。</p>
<p>'My dear girl，there was no need for this，'said Mrs March．</p>
<p>“我亲爱的孩子，你不必这么做，”马奇太太说。</p>
<p>'She doesn't look like my Jo，but I love her dearly for doing it！'said Beth，and began to cry．</p>
<p>“她看起来不像我的琼了，可我因为她这样做而爱她！”白丝说道，随即开始哭起来。</p>
<p>'Don't cry，Beth，'said Jo．'I wanted to do something for Father，and selling my hair was the only thing I could think of doing．I'll soon have a curly head again，which will be short and easy to keep tidy．'</p>
<p>“别哭了，白丝，”琼说，“我想为爸爸做点什么，卖掉我的头发是我唯一能想得出来的事，我不久就会又有一头卷发了，又短又容易梳理。”</p>
<p>But later，when Amy and Beth were asleep and Meg was lying awake， she heard Jo crying．</p>
<p>可过一会儿，当艾米和白丝都睡着了，麦格躺着却睡不着，她听到琼在哭。</p>
<p>'Are you crying about Father，Jo？'she asked．</p>
<p>“你是在为爸爸哭吗，琼？”她问。</p>
<p>'No，not now．It's my hair，'cried Jo．'I'd do it again， if I could．But I did love my hair，and the selfish bit of me is making me cry．Don't tell anyone．I'll be all right in the morning．'</p>
<p>“不，现在不是。我是为我的头发，”琼哭道，“如果我能够，我还会再做一次的，可我确实很爱我的头发，我自私的一面在使我哭泣。别告诉别人。我早晨就会好的。”</p>
<p>During the days after their mother and Mr Brooke went away，Meg aud Jo went back to their jobs，and Beth and Amy helped Hannah to keep the house tidy．Everyone tried very hard to be good and hard-working and helpful．</p>
<p>她们的母亲和布鲁克先生走后的日子里，麦格和琼回去工作了，白丝和艾米帮海娜整理房子。每个人都非常努力，想要做好，想要勤奋工作，想要帮助别人。</p>
<p>News of their father came through，at first telling them he was dangerously ill，but then saying he was slowly getting better．</p>
<p>关于父亲的消息传来，一开始说他病情很危险，可后来说他正在慢慢地好转。</p><a href='11.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
