<p><b>2．三幽灵中的第一位 </b></p>
<p>When Scrooge woke up，it was very dark in the room．He heard the church clock start striking，and listened to see what the time was．To his great surprise，the heavy bell went on striking up to twelve，then stopped．Twelve o'clock！ It was past two in the morning when he had gone to bed．The clock must be wrong！He looked at his watch．It said twelve o'clock too！</p>
<p>当斯克罗吉醒来的时候，房间里黑极了。他听见教堂的钟声响了，他听着想知道是几点了。令他大吃一惊的是，沉重的钟声一直敲了12下，然后停了。12点了！他上床睡觉的时候已经是凌晨2点了。一定是钟出了问题！他看了看他的手表，也是12点。</p>
<p>‘Have I slept all day？Is it the next night already？’scrooge asked himself．‘Or has something happened to the sun？Perhaps it's midday，not midnight！But that's impossible！’</p>
<p>“我睡了一整天吗？难道已经是第二天夜里了吗？”斯克罗吉问自己。“或者是太阳出了问题？也许是正午而不是午夜！但那又不太可能。”</p>
<p>He climbed out of bed，and felt his way to the window．But there was nobody outside in the dark，foggy streets，and he realized it must be night-time．He went back to bed again，but could not sleep．He was worried，because he could not understand what was happening．‘Was Marley's ghost a dream？’he wondered．‘But it seemed very real…’</p>
<p>他下了床，摸黑来到窗前，但外面漆黑的、雾蒙蒙的街上一个人也没有，他知道一定是晚上。他又上了床，但是却睡不着。他忧心忡忡，因为他不明白正在发生的一切。“马利的鬼魂是梦吗？”他想知道。“但它似乎是真的。”</p>
<p>He lay awake until he heard the clock striking a quarter to the hour．Suddenly he remembered．The ghost had warned him that a spirit would visit him at one o'clock．He decided to stay awake until one o'clock had passed．The quarter of an hour passed very slowly，but at last he heard the clock striking the four quarters．</p>
<p>他睁着眼睛躺着直到听见钟敲45分。突然他记起了。鬼魂曾警告过他1点钟时有个幽灵要来见他。他决定睁眼等到1点钟过去。15分钟过得极慢，但最后他终于听到钟敲了4刻。</p>
<p>‘It's one o'clock！’cried Scrooge delightedly，‘and nothing has happened！’But he spoke before the hour bell had sounded．The clock now struck a deep，sad ONE，and immediately light shone into Scrooge's bedroom．The curtains round his bed were pulled open．Scrooge sat up in bed，and stared at his ghostly visitor．</p>
<p>“1点了！”斯克罗吉高兴地大叫道，“而且什么也没发生！”但他是在整点的铃响之前说这番话的。现在钟敲了沉闷悲伤的1点，立刻就有亮光照进了斯克罗吉的卧室。他床周围的帘子被扯开了。斯克罗吉从床上坐起注视着鬼魂般的来访者。</p>
<p>A strange figure，half like a child，half like an old man， looked back at him．It had long，white hair，but its skin was soft and young．It wore a short，white robe，covered with both summer and winter flowers．But the strangest thing about it was that from the top of its head shone a bright，clear light．</p>
<p>一个奇怪的影子，一半像孩子，一半像老头儿，回头看着他。它的头发又长又白，但它的皮肤柔软而富有弹性。它穿着白色的短袍子，上面满是夏季和冬季的花儿。但最奇怪的是它的头顶上闪耀出明亮的光。</p>
<p>Perhaps this light was sometimes too bright，because under one arm it carried a hat，which looked like a large extinguisher．</p>
<p>也许这光有时太亮了，因为它的一只胳膊下夹着一顶帽子，看上去像是一个大的灭火工具。</p>
<p>‘Who and what are you，sir？’asked Scrooge．</p>
<p>“你是谁，是干什么的，先生？”斯克罗吉问。</p>
<p>‘I am the ghost of Christmas Past，’replied the spirit，in a soft，gentle voice．</p>
<p>“我是昔日圣诞鬼魂，”幽灵用柔弱、温柔的声音回答说。</p>
<p>‘Do you mean long ago in the past？’asked Scrooge．</p>
<p>“你是指过去很久以前吗？”斯克罗吉问。</p>
<p>‘No．Your past．’</p>
<p>“不。是你的过去。”</p>
<p>‘Spirit，please tell me why you are here．’</p>
<p>“幽灵，请告诉我你为什么来这儿。”</p>
<p>‘I am here for your own good，’answered the ghost．</p>
<p>“我来这儿纯粹是为了你好，”鬼魂说。</p>
<p>‘Thank you，’replied Scrooge politely．But secretly he thought，‘Bah！A night of unbroken sleep is a more useful thing to have！’</p>
<p>“谢谢你，”斯克罗吉礼貌地回答说，但他心里想，“呸！睡个一晚上没人打扰的觉比什么都强。”</p>
<p>The spirit seemed to hear him thinking，and said at once，‘I am here to help you change your life！Watch and listen！’It put out a strong hand，and held Scrooge by the arm．‘Get up，and come with me！’</p>
<p>幽灵似乎懂得了他在想什么，便立刻说，“我来这儿是帮助你改变你的生活的！看好了，听清楚！”它伸出一只强有力的手，抓住斯克罗吉的胳膊。“起来跟我走！”</p>
<p>It was dark and cold outside．Scrooge did not want to go anywhere，and for a moment he thought about pretending to be too ill to go out．But he did not like to refuse，so he said nothing，and got out of bed．Together they passed through the wall of the house out into the darkness．</p>
<p>外面又黑又冷。斯克罗吉哪儿也不想去，所以一时间他想装成病入膏盲的样子无法出去，但他又不愿拒绝，所以他什么也没说就下了床。他们一起穿过房子的墙壁来到了夜色中。</p>
<p>Suddenly Scrooge realized they were standing on an open country road，with fields on each side．London，the fog，and the darkness had all disappeared，and it was a clear，cold， winter day，with snow on the ground．</p>
<p>忽然斯克罗吉发觉他们来到了一条空旷的乡间马路上，两边都是田野。伦敦、浓雾和黑夜都已消失，现在是一个晴朗、寒冷的冬日，地上覆盖着积雪。</p>
<p>‘Good Heavens！’cried Scrooge．‘I was born near here！I rememher it well！’</p>
<p>“天哪！”斯克罗吉喊道。“我出生在这儿附近，我记得很清楚！”</p>
<p>The spirit looked kindly at the old man．‘How strange that you've forgotten it for so many years！What is that on your face？Are you crying？’</p>
<p>幽灵友善地看着这位老人。“奇怪得很，这么多年你都把这忘记了！你脸上是什么？你哭了吗？”</p>
<p>Scrooge put a hand over his eyes．‘It's nothing—I've got a cold，that's all．Take me where you want，spirit！’</p>
<p>斯克罗吉用一只手捂住他的眼。“没事儿——只是我得了感冒。幽灵，带我去你想去的地方吧！”</p>
<p>Scrooge recognized every field，post，and tree，as they walked along the road towards a little market town．All around thgm were young schoolboys on horses and in farmers’carts，laughing and wishing each other a merry Christmas，as they travelled to their homes for the Christmas holiday．</p>
<p>在他们去往一个小集镇的路上，斯克罗吉认出了每一片田野，每一处城堡和每一棵树木。他们周围到处都是学校的男孩子们，他们有的骑在马上，有的坐在农夫的马车里，在他们赶回家过圣诞节的路上，他们笑着并彼此祝愿圣诞快乐。</p>
<p>‘They are only shadows from the past，’said the spirit．‘They cannot see us．’</p>
<p>“他们只不过是过去的影子，”幽灵说。“他们看不见我们。”</p>
<p>Scrooge knew and named all of them．Why was he so delighted to see them？Why did his cold heart beat faster when they went past，shouting‘Merry Christmas！’？What was‘merry Christmas’to Scrooge？What good had it ever done to him？</p>
<p>斯克罗吉全都认识他们，并能叫出他们的名字。为什么他看见他们这么高兴？为什么当他们走过，高喊着“圣诞快乐”时，他冷酷的心跳得快了？“圣诞快乐”对斯克罗吉意味着什么？它给他带来了什么好处？</p>
<p>‘Not everyone has left the school，’said the ghost．‘There is one lonely child there still，one child whose friends have all gone．’</p>
<p>“不是所有的孩子们都离开了学校，”鬼魂说。“那儿还有一个孤独的孩子，他的朋友们全都走了。”</p>
<p>‘I know！’said Scrooge．And now he was crying openly．</p>
<p>“我知道！”斯克罗吉说。现在他毫不掩饰地哭了。</p>
<p>They turned into a smaller road，and soon came to the school．Inside，in the long，cold，silent classroom，a lonely boy sat reading near a small fire．When he saw his poor forgotten past self，Scrooge sat down at one of the desks，put his head in his hands and cried．</p>
<p>他们拐到了一条更小的路上，不一会儿就来到了学校。在那间狭长、寒冷、寂静的教室里，一个孤独的孩子正坐在微弱的火旁着书。当他看见自己那寒酸的、已被忘却的过去的自己时，斯克罗吉坐在一张课桌旁，双手抱头哭了。</p>
<p>‘Poor boy！I wish—but it's too late now．’</p>
<p>“可怜的孩子啊！我希望——但现在太晚了。”</p>
<p>‘What's the matter？’asked the spirit．</p>
<p>“什么事？”幽灵问。</p>
<p>‘There was a boy singing Christmas carols at my door yesterday．I'm sorry I didn't give him anything，that's all．’</p>
<p>“昨天有一个男孩子在我的门口唱圣诞颂歌，很抱歉我什么也没给他，就是这事儿。”</p>
<p>The ghost smiled，and lifted its hand，saying，‘Let's see another past Christmas！’</p>
<p>鬼魂笑了，举起一只手说，“咱们再去看看另外一个昔日圣诞节。”</p>
<p>The schoolroom became darker and dirtier．There was the young Scrooge again，a little older and bigger than before．He was not reading this time，but was walking up and down， looking very unhappy．The door opened，and a little girl， much younger than him，came running in．Putting her arms round his neck，she said lovingly to him，‘I've come to bring you home，dear brother！Father is so much kinder than he used to be！The other day I asked him if you could come home，and he said yes！And we're going to spend Christmas together，and have the merriest time！’she was laughing delightedly as she began to pull him towards the door．They went out happily together，hand in hand．</p>
<p>教室变得更暗更脏了，又出现了年轻的斯克罗吉，比以前稍微长大了一些而且个头高了一些。这次他没在看书，而是来回踱着步，看上去很不高兴。门开了，跑进来一个比他小得多的女孩儿。她双手搂着他的脖子亲昵地对他说，“我是来带你回家的，亲爱的哥哥！父亲比从前慈爱多了。不久前的一天，我问他你可不可以回家，他答应了！我们可以一起过圣诞节了，而且会过得比以前都快活！”她开始把他往门口拉并开心地笑着。他们手拉着手，一起高兴地出去了。</p>
<p>‘What a warm heart she had！’said the ghost．</p>
<p>“她真是热心肠！”鬼魂说。</p>
<p>‘You're right，’said Scrooge．‘I agree with you，spirit！’</p>
<p>“你说得对。”斯克罗吉说。“我同意你的看法。”</p>
<p>‘She married，I understand，’continued the ghost，‘and had children，I think，before she died．’</p>
<p>“她结婚了，我知道，”鬼魂继续说，“而且我想，在她死之前有了孩子。”</p>
<p>‘One child，’answered Scrooge．</p>
<p>“有一个孩子，”斯克罗吉回答说。</p>
<p>‘True，’said the ghost．‘Your nephew！’</p>
<p>“对，”鬼魂说。“你的外甥！”</p>
<p>Scrooge did not answer at once．‘Yes，’he said at last．</p>
<p>斯克罗吉没有马上回答。“是的，”他最后说。</p>
<p>Now the school had disappeared，and they were in the middle of a busy town，with shadowy crowds and carts all around them．Here it was Christmas time again，but it was evening， and there were lights in the shops and streets．</p>
<p>现在学校不见了，他们来到了一座繁忙的镇子中心，周围都是模糊的人群和马车。这里也是圣诞节的日子，但已是夜晚，商店和大街上都亮起了灯。</p>
<p>The ghost stopped at an office door．‘Do you know this place，Scrooge？’he asked．</p>
<p>鬼魂在一个办公室的门前停下。“你认识这个地方吗，斯克罗吉？”它问。</p>
<p>‘Know it！’cried Scrooge．‘Why，I was a clerk here！’</p>
<p>“认识！”斯克罗吉大声说。“怎么了，我曾是这儿的一名雇员啊！”</p>
<p>They went in，and when they saw a large，kind-looking old gentleman sitting at a high desk，Scrooge cried excitedly，‘Good Heavens，it's old Fezziwig！God bless him！It's Fezziwig alive again！’</p>
<p>他们走了进去，当他们看见一位身材魁梧、慈眉善目的老绅士坐在一张高高的桌子旁时，斯克罗吉兴奋地喊道，“天哪，他是老费泽威格！上帝保佑他！费泽威格又活了！”</p>
<p>Old Fezziwig put down his pen，and looked at the clock．Fastening his coat buttons over his fat stomach，he started laughing as he called out in a rich，deep，happy voice， ‘Ebenezer！Dick！Seven o'clock！No more work tonight！It'sChristmas Eve，remember！’</p>
<p>老费泽威格放下笔，看了看表。系好覆于其胖肚子上的外衣扣子，他一边用圆润、低沉、幸福的声音大声说，“埃比尼泽！迪克！7点了！今晚就干到这儿了。记得吗，今天是圣诞节！”一边开始笑了起来。</p>
<p>The young Scrooge hurried in，with another clerk．</p>
<p>年轻的斯克罗吉带着另一个雇员匆匆地进来了。</p>
<p>‘That's Dick Wilkins！’said Scrooge quietly to the ghost．</p>
<p>“这是迪克&middot;威尔金斯！”斯克罗吉悄悄地告诉鬼魂。</p>
<p>‘He always liked me．Oh dear！poor Dick！’</p>
<p>“他一直都喜欢我。噢，亲爱的。可怜的迪克！”</p>
<p>Together the two young clerks put away all the pens and papers，and，following Fezziwig's orders，cleared all the furniture away from the centre of the room．In came a fiddler．In came Mrs Fezziwig，fat and smiling．In came the three Fezziwig daughters，sweet and pretty．In came the six young men who were in love with them．In came the cook，with her young man，the milkman．In came the boy from next door， with the girl from the house opposite．In they came，some quietly，some noisily，but all happy because it was Ghristmas Eve．The fiddler started playing，and away they all went in the dance，twenty pairs at the same time，round and round， down the middle and up again．When they were all tired，old Fezziwig cried out，‘Well done！Now，have something to eat and drink！’there was cake and hot meat and bread and cold meat and fruit，and all kinds of drinks，on a long table near the door．And after they had eaten，they danced again．</p>
<p>两个年轻的雇员一起把所有的笔和文件都收拾好放到了一边，并按照费泽威格的吩咐把所有的家具都从屋子中央挪开。一个小提琴手走了进来；费泽威格走了进来，胖胖的，面带笑容；费泽威格的三个女儿走了进来，她们长得甜甜的而且很漂亮；六个爱着这三位姑娘的年轻人走了进来；厨师和她年轻的丈夫，送奶工走了进来；隔壁家的男孩，带着对面房子里的女孩走了进来。他们都进来了，有的静悄悄的，有的吵吵嚷嚷的，但都兴高采烈，因为今天是圣诞节。小提琴手开始演奏，他们全都加入到跳舞者的行列，同时有20对儿，来回地转着圈跳着。当他们都跳累了的时候，老费泽威格大声说，“跳得好极了！现在吃点东西或喝点什么吧！”在门口的一张长桌子上摆着蛋糕、烧好的热乎乎的肉、面包、冻肉、水果和各种喝的。他们吃过之后又重新跳舞。</p>
<p>When the clock struck eleven，the dancing ended．Mr and Mrs Fezziwig stood by the door，shaking hands with each person as he or she went out，and wishing him or her a merry Christmas．</p>
<p>当钟敲11点的时候，舞会结束了。费泽威格先生和太太站在门口，他们和每个离开的人一一握手并祝愿他或她圣诞快乐。</p>
<p>During this time Scrooge had thought of nothing except what was happening in front of his eyes．He remembered and enjoyed it all with the greatest delight．But when the dancing came to an end，he realized that the ghost was looking at him．The light on the spirit's head was burning very clearly．</p>
<p>在这斯间斯克罗吉想的只是他眼前所发生的一切。他以从未有过的兴奋，记住了发生的一切并且觉得一切都很开心。但当舞会结束的时候，他觉察到鬼魂正看着他。幽灵头上的光明亮地闪烁着。</p>
<p>‘It seems easy enough to amuse these childish people，’said the ghost．‘It was nothing much that Fezziwig did，was it？ After all，he only spent a few pounds，on food and drink and paying the fiddler．’</p>
<p>“好像轻而易举就能给这些傻里傻气的人们带来娱乐，”鬼魂说。“费泽威格并没做多少事情，不是吗？他充其量不过是花了几个英镑买了些吃的、喝的和付了小提琴手的报酬。”</p>
<p>‘It isn't a question of money，’replied Scrooge warmly．He was speaking like the young man he used to be，not the old man he was now．‘No，spirit，you see，our employer can make us happy or sad．His words，his looks，all these things are so important！The happiness that he gives is just as valuable as money！’</p>
<p>“这不是钱的问题。”斯克罗吉热情地回答说。他说话的样子和他年轻时一样，可不是现在年迈的那副神情。“不，幽灵，要知道，我们的雇主能够令我们高兴或悲伤。他的话语、他的表情，所有这些都很重要！他给我们带来的幸福同金钱一样有价值！”</p>
<p>He suddenly stopped speaking，when he felt the spirit watching him closely．</p>
<p>当他感到幽灵正密切地注视着他的时候，他不再说下去了。</p>
<p>‘What's the matter？’asked the ghost．</p>
<p>“怎么了？”鬼魂问。</p>
<p>‘Er—nothing，’said Scrooge．‘Just that—I'd like to be able to say a word or two to my clerk now．’</p>
<p>“哦——没什么，”斯克罗吉说，“只是——我想现在和我的雇员说一两句话。”</p>
<p>Now Scrooge could see himself again．He was older now， and it was clear that he was beginning to show an unhealthy interest in money．His eyes were restless，and his mouth looked thin and mean．He was not alone，but was sitting beside a lovely young girl．The light that shone brightly from the ghost of Christmas Past showed that she was crying．</p>
<p>斯克罗吉现在又能看见他本人了。他现在比以前老了，很显然他对钱已经显示出一种不良的兴趣。他目光焦虑，嘴看上去刻薄且吝啬。他不是独自一人，他身边坐着一个可爱的姑娘。借着“昔日圣诞”鬼魂身上发出的明亮的光可以看出她在哭。</p>
<p>‘I know it doesn't matter very much to you，’she said softly．‘You care about gold more than you care about me．Perhaps I shouldn't be sad．Money will give you the happiness that I wanted to give you．’</p>
<p>“我知道这对你来说算不了什么，”她轻柔地说，“你把金子看得比我还重。也许我不该难过，金钱会给你带来我想带给你的幸福的。”</p>
<p>‘But I haven't changed towards you，have I？’</p>
<p>“但对你我并没变心，不是吗？”</p>
<p>‘You have changed．We promised to marry a long time ago，when we were both poor，and happy to be poor．I have stayed the same，but you have different hopes and dreams now．I loved the man that you used to be，but I know that you do not wish to marry me any more．So I've come to tell you that you're free．Be happy in the life that you've chosen！’And she left him．</p>
<p>“你已经变了。在很久以前当我们都还很穷但又穷得快乐的时候我们就许诺过要结婚。我一直没改变想法，但你现在有了不同的希望和理想。我爱的是过去的你，但我知道你不再想娶我了，所以我来是想告诉你你自由了。祝你在你自己选择的道路上幸福生活！”她离开了他。</p>
<p>‘Spirit！’cried Scrooge．‘Show me no more！Take me home！This is too painful！’</p>
<p>“幽灵！”斯克罗吉大声说，“别再让我看下去了！带我回家吧！这太痛苦了！”</p>
<p>‘One shadow more！’said the ghost．</p>
<p>“还有一个影子！”鬼魂说。</p>
<p>‘No more！’cried Scrooge．‘I don't wish to see any more！’But the spirit held his arms，and he could not escape．</p>
<p>“一个也不要再看了！”斯克罗吉高声喊道。“我不想再看了！”但幽灵抓住他的胳膊，所以他无法逃脱。</p>
<p>Now they were in another place，in a room which was not very large，but comfortable．Near the fire sat a beautiful young girl．Scrooge thought she was the girl that he had just seen，until he saw her，now a good-looking married lady，sitting opposite her daughter．The room was full of children，and noise，and shouting，and laughing．Just then the door opened， and the father entered，carrying a great pile of Christmas presents．The noise became twice as loud，as the children received their presents with delight，and kissed their father gratefully．Finally，the younger ones went upstairs to bed，and Scrooge watched more sadly than ever，as the father sat down with his loving daughter and her mother by the fire．</p>
<p>现在他们来到了另一个地方，一个不是很大但非常舒适的房间里。火边坐着一位漂亮的年轻姑娘。斯克罗吉想她就是刚才看到过的女孩，到他见到她时，她已是一位漂亮的已婚妇女了，她坐在女儿的对面。房间里都是孩子，满屋子吵闹声、喊叫声和笑声。这时门开了，父亲抱着一大摞圣诞礼物走了进来。当孩子们高兴地拿到礼物时，吵闹声比刚才高了一倍，他们充满感激地吻了父亲。最后，小点儿的孩子们上楼睡觉去了。父亲同他可爱的女儿及妻子在火炉旁坐下，这时，斯克罗吉比往常更加伤心地看着。</p>
<p>‘Belle，’said the husband，turning to his wife with a smile，‘I saw an old friend of yours this afternoon．Guess who？ Mr Scrooge！He was sitting alone in his office．His partner is dying，and I don't think he has any other friends．’</p>
<p>“贝尔，”丈夫说着把脸转向妻子，面带微笑。“我今天下午看见了你的一位老朋友，你猜他是谁？斯克罗吉先生！他正独自一人坐在他的办公室里。他的合伙人快要死了，我认为他再没有别的朋友了。”</p>
<p>‘Spirit！’said Scrooge in a broken voice．‘Take me away from this place．’</p>
<p>“幽灵！”斯克罗吉用颤抖的声音说。“带我离开这个地方吧。”</p>
<p>‘These are shadows of the things that happened in the past，’said the ghost．‘You chose the life that you preferred， so why cry now？’</p>
<p>“这都是过去所发生的事情的影子，”鬼魂说，“你选择了你喜欢的生活，现在干嘛要哭呢？”</p>
<p>‘I can't watch any more！It's too awful！Leave me alone， spirit！’And Scrooge，noticing that the ghostly light was burning high and bright，suddenly took the extinguisher，and pushed it down hard on the spirit's head．But although it covered the ghost's head and body，Scrooge could not hide the light，which continued to shine out strongly from underneath．</p>
<p>“我不能再看下去了！太可怕了！幽灵，让我一个人呆着吧！”当斯克罗吉看到鬼火高高地明晃晃地照着时，他突然夺下灭火器，重重地放在了幽灵的头上。但尽管它盖住了鬼魂的头和身体，斯克罗吉还是盖不住它身上的光，那光依旧从下面强烈地放射出来。</p>
<p>Now Scrooge found himself back in his own bedroom again．Feeling very tired，he climbed into bed and at once fell into a deep，heavy sleep．</p>
<p>现在斯克罗吉发现他又回到了自己的卧室。感觉非常疲劳，他爬上床立刻就进入了沉睡的梦乡。</p><a href='3.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
