<p><b>5．故事的结尾 </b></p>
<p>Yes！and the bedpost was his own．The bed was his own，the room was his own．Best and happiest of all， the future was his own， to change his life in！</p>
<p>是的！床柱子是他自己的，床是他自己的，房间是他自己的，最好最幸福的，能够改变他未来的生活也是他自己。</p>
<p>‘I will remember the past，and think of the future，’repeated Scrooge，as he jumped out of bed．‘God bless you，Jacob Marley！And God bless Christmas！’</p>
<p>“我将记住过去，并要为将来考虑，”斯克罗吉重复着并跳下了床。“上帝保佑你，雅各布&middot;马利！上帝保佑圣诞节！”</p>
<p>In his excitement he found it difficult to speak．His face was still wet from crying．‘Here are my bed－curtains！’he cried delightedly．‘They aren't stolen！ And I'm alive！Those were only shadows of things that may be！The future will be different！I know it will！’</p>
<p>他兴奋之中发现说话有些吃力。他的脸上依旧是泪迹斑斑。“这是我的床围子！”他高兴地说。“它们没被偷走！我还活着！那些不过是可能发生的事情的影子！未来会全然不同的！我知道会的！”</p>
<p>All this time his hands were busy，hurriedly putting on his clothes．He put his left foot in his right shoe，couldn't find the buttons on his shirt，and forgot to brush his hair．</p>
<p>他的手一直没闲着，他匆匆穿好衣服。他把左脚穿进了右脚的鞋子里，找不到衬衣上的钮扣，忘记了梳头。</p>
<p>‘I don't know what I'm doing！’said Scrooge， laughing and crying at the same time．‘A merry Christmas to everybody！A happy new year to all the world！Hurrah！ There's the door which Jacob's ghost came through！There's the corner where the ghost of Christmas Present sat！There's the window where I saw the travelling ghosts！It's all true，it all happened！Ha ha ha！’</p>
<p>“我不知道我在做什么！”斯克罗吉笑着大声说。“祝所有的人圣诞快乐！祝整个世界新年快乐！好哇！雅各布就是从这个门进来的！“今日圣诞”鬼魂就是坐在这个角落里！我就是从这扇窗户看见了游荡的鬼魂们！这全是真的，这全都发生过！哈哈哈！”</p>
<p>Really，for a man who hadn't laughed for so many years，it was an excellent laugh．The father of a long line of excellent laughs！</p>
<p>的确，对一个若干年没有笑过的人来说，这笑太开怀了。这是一长串开怀大笑之最！</p>
<p>‘I don't know what day of the month it is！’said Scrooge．‘I don't know how long I've been with the spirits！I don't know anything．I'm just like a baby．Never mind！I prefer being a baby！Hurrah！’</p>
<p>“我不知道今天是几号了！”斯克罗吉说。“我不知道我和幽灵们呆了多久！我什么都不知道，我就像个婴儿！别介意！我宁愿当个婴儿！好哇！”</p>
<p>Just then he heard the church bells ring out louder than he had ever heard before．Running to the window， he opened it and looked out．No fog at all， a clear， bright， cold day， golden sunlight， blue sky，sweet clean air，merry bells．Oh， wonderful！wonderful！</p>
<p>这时他听见教堂的钟声敲得比以往要响。他跑到窗前，打开窗户朝外望去。根本没有雾，天气晴朗、明亮、寒冷，金色的日光，湛蓝的天空，清新的空气，快乐的铃铛声。噢，太美妙了！太美妙了！</p>
<p>‘What's today？’he cried，calling down to a boy in the street．</p>
<p>“今天是什么日子？”他叫住街上的一个男孩大声地问。</p>
<p>‘Today？’replied the boy，in great surprise．‘Why，it's Christmas Day！’</p>
<p>“今天？”孩子大为吃惊地回答说，“怎么啦，今天是圣诞节！”</p>
<p>‘So I haven't missed it！’thought Scrooge．‘The spirits have done it all in one night！’He called down to the boy again，‘Hallo， young man！Do you know the meat shop at the corner of the next street？ ’</p>
<p>“所以我没错过它！”斯克罗吉想，“幽灵们在一夜之间做完了这些事情！”他又叫那个男孩停下，“喂，小孩！你认识下一条街角的那家肉店吗？”</p>
<p>‘Of course I do，’replied the boy．</p>
<p>“当然认识。”男孩回答说。</p>
<p>‘What an intelligent boy！’said Scrooge．‘Do you know if they've sold the big turkey that was in the shop window yesterday？’</p>
<p>“多聪明的孩子啊！”斯克罗吉说。“你知道他们昨天有没有把橱窗里最大的火鸡卖掉？”</p>
<p>‘What，the one as big as me？’asked the boy．</p>
<p>“什么，那只像我这么大的火鸡？”男孩问。</p>
<p>‘What a delightful boy！’said Scrooge．‘It's wonderful talking to him．Yes， that's the one！’</p>
<p>“多么可爱的孩子啊！”斯克罗吉说，“同他说话真是太好了。是的，就是那只！”</p>
<p>‘It's still there in the window，’said the boy．</p>
<p>“它还在橱窗里摆着呢。”男孩说。</p>
<p>‘Is it？’said Scrooge．‘Well， go and buy it．’</p>
<p>一是吗？”斯克罗吉说。“那好，你去把它买下来。”</p>
<p>‘You don't mean it！’cried the by．</p>
<p>“你不是这意思吧！”男孩大声说。</p>
<p>‘I do，I do．I'm serious．Go and buy it，and tell the man to bring it back here．Come back with the man and I'll give you a shilling．Come back in less than five minutes and I'll give you three shillings！’</p>
<p>“我是这意思，我是这意思。我没开玩笑。去把它买下来，井让店主送到这儿来。你和店主一起回来，我就给你一先令。如果在5分钟之内回来我就给你三个先令！”</p>
<p>The by went off like a bullet from a gun．</p>
<p>男孩像出了枪膛的子弹一样很快消失了。</p>
<p>‘I'll send the turkey to Bob Cratchit's！ laughed Scrooge．‘He'll never know who's sent it！It's twice as big as Tiny Tim！Ha ha ha！’</p>
<p>“我要把这只火鸡送给鲍勃&middot;克拉奇蒂一家！”斯克罗吉笑了广他永远也不会知道是谁送去的！它比小蒂姆还大一倍！哈哈哈！”</p>
<p>He went on laughing as he wrote Bob's address，gave it to the man with the turkey，and paid for a taxi，because the turkey was much too heavy to carry all the way to Camden Town．</p>
<p>他一边写鲍勃的地址一边笑着，他把地址递给了那个抱着火鸡的人，并叫了一辆出租车付了费，因为那只火鸡太沉了，无法一路抱到卡姆登镇。</p>
<p>Now he finished dressing，and went out into the streets， wearing his best clothes．The town was full of happy， busy people，and Scrooge smiled at all of them．Three or four men said cheerfully to him， ‘Good morning，sir！ And a merry Christmas to you！’scrooge thought these were the best sounds that he had ever heard．</p>
<p>现在他穿好了衣服，他穿着他最好的衣服出去来到了街上。镇子上到处都是幸福、忙碌的人们，斯克罗吉对每个人都微笑着。有三四个人高兴地对他说：“早上好，先生！祝你圣诞快乐！”斯克罗吉觉得这是他曾经听到过的最美妙的声音。</p>
<p>As he was walking， he suddenly noticed one of the comfortable-looking gentlemen who had come to his office to ask for money for the poor．Scrooge went straight up to him， took the old gentleman by both hands，and said，‘My dear sir，how are you？ A merry Christmas to you， sir！’</p>
<p>他走着走着忽然发现了曾经到他办公室为穷人要钱，长相英俊的一位绅士。斯克罗吉径直朝他走去，握住那位老先生的双手说，“我亲爱的先生，你好吗？祝你圣诞快乐，先生！”</p>
<p>‘Mr Scrooge？’asked the gentleman，surprised．</p>
<p>“斯克罗吉先生吗？”绅士惊奇地问。</p>
<p>‘Yes， that's my name．I'm very sorry for what I said to you when you visited me yesterday．Will you please—’and he spoke very quietly in the gentleman's ear．</p>
<p>“是的，我是斯克罗吉。我为我昨天所说的话感到抱歉。你可以——”他悄悄地对着绅士的耳朵说。</p>
<p>‘Good Heavens！’cried the gentleman．‘My dear Mr Scrooge，are you serious？’</p>
<p>“我的天哪！”绅士大声说道，“我亲爱的斯克罗吉先生，你是当真吗？”</p>
<p>‘I am．Not a shilling less．I must tell you，I haven't given anything to anyone for years．’</p>
<p>“我说话算数。一先令也不会少。我必须告诉你，若干年来，我从未给过任何人任何东西。”</p>
<p>‘My dear sir！’said the gentleman，shaking hands with him．‘I don't know how to thank you for—’</p>
<p>“我亲爱的先生！”绅士说着并同他握手。“这——我不知道该如何感激您。”</p>
<p>Don't say anything，please，’replied Scrooge．‘Will you come and see me tomorrow about it？’</p>
<p>“请什么也不要说，”斯克罗吉回答说。“你明天能就此事来见我吗？”</p>
<p>‘I will！’cried the old gentleman happily．</p>
<p>“我会的。”老绅士高兴地大声说。</p>
<p>‘Thank you，and God bless you！’said Scrooge．</p>
<p>“谢谢你，愿上帝保佑你！”斯克罗吉说。</p>
<p>He went to church， and watched the people，and gave children money for sweets， and discovered that he had never been so happy in his life．In the afternoon he went to his nephew's house He passed the door several times before he was brave enough to knock．But at last he did it，and was taken into the sitting-room，where Fred and his pretty wife were waiting for their friends to arrive for dinner．</p>
<p>他去做了礼拜，看着教堂里的人们，给孩子们钱去买糖果，他发现他一生中从未这样幸福过。下午他去了他外甥家。他在门前走了好几趟，因为他没有勇气敲门。但最后他还是敲了，他被带进了起居室，弗雷德和他漂亮的妻子正在这儿等着他们的朋友来吃晚饭。</p>
<p>‘Fred！’said Scrooge．‘It's your uncle Scrooge．I've come to dinner．Will you let me stay， Fred？’</p>
<p>“弗雷德！”斯克罗吉说。“我是你舅舅斯克罗吉，我是来吃晚饭的。你会留我吗，弗雷德？”</p>
<p>Let him stay！Fred almost shook his uncle's arm off．Scrooge felt at home in five minutes．Nothing could be merrier．And what a wonderful dinner they had！Wonderful party，wonderful games，wonderful happiness！</p>
<p>让他留下。弗雷德都快把他舅舅的胳膊摇掉了。5分钟后斯克罗吉就不再拘束了。没有什么比这更快乐了。他们的晚餐真是棒极了！绝妙的晚会，绝妙的游戏，无与伦比的幸福！</p>
<p>But he was early at the office next morning．Oh，he was there early．He wanted to catch Bob Cratchit arriving late．And he did！The clock struck nine．No Bob．A quarter past．No Bob．He was eighteen and a half minutes late when he finally hurried in．Scrooge was sitting with his office door open．</p>
<p>但第二天早晨他早早地赶到了办公室。噢，他到的很早，他想抓住鲍勃来晚了，他确实抓到了！钟敲了9点，鲍勃没来。过了一刻钟，鲍勃还是没来。当他匆忙进来的时候，他迟到了18分半。斯克罗吉坐在那儿，他办公室的门敞开着。</p>
<p>‘Hallo！’said Scrooge in his old，hard voice．‘What do you mean by coming here so late？’</p>
<p>“喂！”斯克罗吉用他年迈、刻薄的声音说，“你这么晚才来是什么意思？”</p>
<p>I'm very sorry，sir， said Bob．‘I am late．It's only once a year．We were rather merry yesterday，sir．’</p>
<p>“先生，很抱歉，”鲍勃说。“我确实是晚了。一年中不就这么一次吗。先生，我们昨天过得太快活了。”</p>
<p>‘Now I'll tell you what，my friend，said Scrooge，‘I'm not going to have this any longer．And so’，he continued， jumping off his chair and shaking Bob's hand，‘I'm going to pay you twice as much！’</p>
<p>“现在我要告诉你什么，我的朋友，”斯克罗吉说，“我再也不能这样了，所以，”他从椅子上跳出来握着鲍勃的手继续说道，“我要付给你双倍的工资！”</p>
<p>Bob's face went white．For a second or two he thought that Scrooge had gone crazy．</p>
<p>鲍勃的脸变白了。一时间他想斯克罗吉可能是疯了。</p>
<p>‘A merry Christmas，Bob！’said Scrooge，and it was clear that he meant It．‘A merrier Christmas，Bob，than I've given you for a long time．I'm going to pay you well，and help you with your family，and we'll discuss it all this afternoon over a Christmas drink， Bob！ Put more wood on the fire at once， Bob Cratchit，and let's be comfortable！’</p>
<p>“圣诞快乐，鲍勃！”斯克罗吉说，很显然他是真心说这番话的。“鲍勃，祝你有一个，比我以前给你的更为快乐的圣诞。我要给你加薪，而且要帮助你们全家，今天下午我们边喝圣诞酒边商量这件事，鲍勃！马上给火里多加些木柴，鲍勃&middot;拉克奇蒂，咱们也舒服点！”</p>
<p>Scrooge did everything that he had promised，and more．To Tiny Tim， who did NOT die，he became a second father．He became as good a friend，employer and man， as anyone in London or in the world．Some people laughed to see the change in him，but he did not care．His own heart laughed inside him，and that was good enough for him．He never had any more conversations with spirits， but kept Christmas cheerfully，and lived a happy life．That is what all of us want， and so，as Tiny Tim said，‘God bless us， every one！’</p>
<p>斯克罗吉兑现了他所有的承诺，甚至更多。对小蒂姆来说，他根本没有死，他成了他的第二个父亲。他同伦敦或是全世界上的任何一个朋友、雇主和男人一样好。有人发现了他的变化就笑，但他不在乎。他从心里笑，这对他来说就够不错的了。他再也没有同幽灵们说过话，但圣诞节他一直过得都很快活，并且生活得很幸福。这也是我们大家共同的心愿，正如小蒂姆所说：“愿上帝保佑我们每个人！”</p></body></html>
