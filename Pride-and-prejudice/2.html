<p><b>2 简生病了 </b></p>
<p>Mr Bennet had a comfortable income of two thousand a year， and a pleasant house in Longbourn． But， unfortu- nately for his daughters， after his death all his property would pass to a distant male relation．Mrs Bennet's father had been a lawyer，and had only left his daughter a small amount of money． She had a brother who owned shops in London， and she also had a sister， married to a Mr Philips． He had been her fa- ther's clerk，and now carried on his late employer's business．</p>
<p>班纳特先生年收入两千英镑，而且在浪搏恩有一处宜人的宅子，生活堪称小康。可是，令女儿们感到遗憾的是，他死后，所有的财产都要由一位远房的男性亲戚来继承。班纳特夫人的父亲曾做过律师，他只给女儿留下很少一笔钱。班纳特夫人有一个弟弟在伦敦开商店，还有一个妹妹，嫁给了菲力普斯先生。菲力普斯曾做过她父亲的职员，现在继承了已故老板的事业。</p>
<p>Mr and Mrs Philips lived in Meryton， which was only a kilo- metre or so from the village of Longbourn．It was a most con- venient distance for the Bennet girls， who were usually tempted there three or four times a week，to visit their aunt or a dress- maker who lived opposite．The youngest daughters， Kitty and Lydia，were particularly regular visitors．Their minds were more vacant than their sisters，’and if no better entertainment was available，a walk to Meryton always provided some amuse- ment， as well as interesting local news from their aunt．</p>
<p>菲力普斯夫妇住在麦里屯，离浪搏恩村只有大约一公里。这个距离对于班纳特家的几位姑娘来说再方便不过了，她们常常禁不住每周上那儿去三四次，去看姨妈或者住在对面专做女式服装的裁缝。最小的两位姑娘，吉蒂和丽迪亚，尤其常去。她们的精神比几个姐姐更空虚，如果没有更好的娱乐方式，到麦里屯走一走总是会给她们带来一些乐趣，她们还会从姨妈那里听到当地一些有趣的新闻。</p>
<p>The latest news， which delighted Kitty and Lydia， was that the regiment which had recently arrived in Meryton was to stay there for the whole winter．The two girls now visited their aunt every day， and as Mr Philips knew all the officers，Kitty and Lydia were soon introduced to them．At home they could talk of nothing but officers and their handsome uniforms：even Mr Bingley's fortune now seemed hardly worth considering．</p>
<p>最新的消息是，最近到达麦里屯的一个兵团要在那里呆整整一个冬天。这个消息使得吉蒂和丽迪亚欣喜异常。这两个姑娘现在每天到姨妈家去。菲力普斯先生认识所有的军官，所以很快就把吉蒂和丽迪亚介绍给了他们。在家里，她们可以什么也不谈，只谈军官和他们漂亮的制服，连彬格莱先生的大笔财产似乎也不值一提。</p>
<p>After listening to their praise of the officers one morning， Mr Bennet said coolly，‘From what I can see，you must be two of the silliest girls in the country．I've suspected it for some time，but now I'm convinced．’</p>
<p>一天早上，班纳特先生听了她们对军官的称赞以后冷冷地说：“依我看，你们俩肯定是全英国最傻的女孩。过去，我还一直怀疑这个，现在我彻底相信了。”</p>
<p>Kitty was embarrassed and did not reply，but Lydia，the youngest， continued to express her admiration for a certain Captain Carter， with perfect indifference．</p>
<p>吉蒂感到害臊，没有吱声。可是最小的丽迪亚毫不在意，继续表达她对一个什么卡特尔上尉的爱慕之情。</p>
<p>‘I am very surprised，my dear，’said Mrs Bennet，‘that you should be so ready to think your own children silly．As it hap- pens， they are all very clever．’</p>
<p>“我真感到奇怪，亲爱的，”班纳特夫人说，“你为什么总是爱把自己的孩子想得那么傻。巧得很，她们都很聪明。”</p>
<p>‘That is the only point，I think， on which we do not agree．I am afraid I must say that I consider our two youngest daugh- ters unusually foolish．’</p>
<p>“我想，只有这一点我们俩意见不一致。恐怕我得说，我们的两个小女儿还不是一般的愚蠢。”</p>
<p>‘My dear Mr Bennet， you mustn't expect such young girls to have the common sense of their father or mother．I remem- ber when I used to like a red coat myself， and indeed I still do．If a good-looking officer with five or six thousand a year want- ed to marry one of my girls， I wouldn't turn him down．And I thought Colonel Forster looked very handsome last night at Sir William's，in his regimental uniform．’</p>
<p>“我亲爱的班纳特先生，她们还小呢，你不能指望她们有父母一样的见识。我记得自己过去就很喜欢红色的外套，确实，我现在还喜欢。如果哪一位年收入五六千英镑的漂亮军官想娶我们的哪个姑娘，我是不会拒绝他的。我觉得福斯特上校昨天晚上在威廉爵士家身穿兵团制服看起来很英浚”</p>
<p>Just then a servant entered with a note for Jane， which had come from Netherfield．Mrs Bennet's eyes shone with pleasure and she called out eagerly， while her daughter was reading it，‘Well，Jane， who is it from？ What does he say？Tell us， tell us quickly，my love！’</p>
<p>这时，一位仆人拿着给简的一张便条走了进来，便条是从尼日斐送来的。班纳特太太喜出望外，眼睛为之一亮，女儿还没看完，她就急切地叫道：“哎呀，简，是谁来的？上面写的什么？告诉我们，快告诉我们，我的乖！”</p>
<p>‘It's from Miss Bingley，’said Jane．‘She invites me to din- ner at Netherfield，as she and her sister are alone．It seems her brother and the gentlemen are having dinner with the officers，in Meryton．’</p>
<p>“是彬格莱小姐来的，”简说，“她邀请我到尼日斐吃饭，因为只有她和她姐姐在家。好像她哥哥和几位先生正在麦里屯和军官们吃饭呢。”</p>
<p>‘With the officers！’cried Lydia．‘I wonder why aunt Philips didn't tell us that！’</p>
<p>“军官们！”丽迪亚大喊一声。“不知道菲力普斯姨妈为什么不把这事儿告诉我们！”</p>
<p>‘Having dinner in Meryton，’repeated Mrs Bennet， shaking her head．‘That's very unlucky．’</p>
<p>“在麦里屯吃饭，”班纳特夫人摇了摇头，重复道，“这太不巧了。”</p>
<p>‘May I take the carriage？’asked Jane．</p>
<p>“我可以坐马车去吗？”简问道。</p>
<p>‘No， my dear， you'd better ride over there， because it looks likely to rain，and then you’ll have to stay the night．’</p>
<p>“不能，亲爱的。你最好骑马过去，因为看起来要下雨了，那样的话，你就得在那儿过夜。”</p>
<p>‘That would be a good plan，’said Elizabeth to her mother，‘if you were sure they wouldn't offer to send her home in their carriage．’</p>
<p>“如果你敢肯定他们不主动提出用他们自己的马车送她回家的话，”伊丽莎白对她妈妈说，“那么，这个计划就很好。”</p>
<p>‘Oh， but they can't！The gentlemen must have taken Mr Bingley's carriage to go to Meryton．’</p>
<p>“哦！可是他们送不了！那几位先生一定坐彬格莱先生的马车到麦里屯去了。”</p>
<p>‘I'd much rather go in the carriage，’Jane said．</p>
<p>“我还是想坐马车去，”简说。</p>
<p>‘But，my dear，your father can't spare the horses， I'm sure．They're needed on the farm， aren't they， Mr Bennet？’</p>
<p>“可是，我亲爱的，你爸爸必须用那几匹马，腾不出空来，肯定不行。班纳特先生，田里还需要它们，是吧？”</p>
<p>Mr Bennet finally agreed that they were in fact being used that day in the fields．So Jane set out on her horse，while her mother called cheerfully after her，‘I do hope it’ll rain heavily，my love！’And Jane had not been gone for long before it rained hard．Elizabeth was a little worried about her sister，but Mrs Bennet was delighted．‘What a good idea of mine that was！’she said more than once， extremely pleased with herself．</p>
<p>班纳特先生不得已，最后终于同意说，是啊，实际上那天田里还在用着牲口呢。于是简骑着自己的马出发了，而她妈妈在后面兴高采烈地喊道：“我真希望雨能下大点儿，乖！”果真，简还没走多大会儿，雨就下大了。伊丽莎白有点担心姐姐，可是，班纳特太太感到庆幸。“我这个主意多妙啊！”她不止一次地这样说，对自己感到极为满意。</p>
<p>Not until the next morning，however，did she realize the full extent of her success．After breakfast a servant from Nether- field arrived with a note from Jane to Elizabeth，explaining that Jane had caught cold on her wet ride， and had been invited to stay at Netherfield until she recovered．</p>
<p>可是，直到第二天早上，她才认识到自己的如意算盘大获成功了。早饭过后，尼日斐来了一位仆人，他从简那里给伊丽莎白带来一张便条，说简雨天骑马感冒了，并且应邀在尼日斐住下，直到康复。</p>
<p>‘Well，my dear，’said Mr Bennet，‘if your daughter should become seriously ill and die， it would be a comfort to know that she died in a good cause， and in obedience to your orders．’</p>
<p>“啊，亲爱的，”班纳特先生说，“如果你女儿病重死去，那么，得知她的死因这样美妙，又是服从了你的命令，也会是一种安慰埃”</p>
<p>‘Oh， I'm not afraid of her dying．People don't die of colds．She’ll be looked after well at Netherfield．As long as she stays there， everything will be all right．’</p>
<p>“哦，我不担心她会死去。得感冒是不会死人的。她在尼日斐会得到悉心照料的。只要她呆在那儿，一切都会好的。”</p>
<p>But Elizabeth felt really anxious，and was determined to go to her sister．As the carriage was not available， and she was not keen on riding， she decided to walk the five kilometres to Netherfield．Kitty and Lydia accompanied her as far as Mery- ton， where they went to visit one of the officers’wives．Eliza- beth continued alone， crossing field after field and jumping im- patiently over streams， in her anxiety to see her sister．</p>
<p>但是，伊丽莎白真正感到焦急，决心去看看姐姐。因为没有马车，她又不热心骑马，所以，她决定步行五公里到尼日斐去。吉蒂和丽迪亚一直把她送到麦里屯，在那里，她们去找一位军官的妻子。伊丽莎白接着就一个人走下去，穿过一片片田地，跨越一条条小溪，心情烦躁，急切地要见到姐姐。</p>
<p>When she arrived at Netherfield，with tired feet，muddy stockings and a face healthily pink with exercise， she was shown straight into the sitting-room． The two sisters， Miss Bingley and Mrs Hurst，could hardly believe that she had come so far alone and on foot in such bad weather， but they received her politely． Their brother， however， was more than polite： he was kind and considerate towards her．Mr Darcy said very little，hesitating between admiration of her healthy good looks and doubt whether she should have come such a distance alone．Mr Hurst said nothing at all，as he was thinking only of his breakfast．</p>
<p>她到达尼日斐以后，两脚乏力，满袜烂泥，由于运动，双颊透着健康的粉红色。她被直接领到了起居室。彬格莱小姐和赫斯特夫人姐妹俩几乎不敢相信，路这么远，天这么坏，她会一个人步行过来，不过她们还是彬彬有礼地接待了她。然而，彬格莱先生可不仅仅是彬彬有礼：他对她和蔼而体贴。达西先生很少说话，既喜爱她健康的模样，又怀疑她该不该这么大老远地过来，心里犹豫不决。赫斯特先生一言不发，只想着吃早饭。</p>
<p>Elizabeth was glad to be taken almost immediately to her sister's room， where she found Jane delighted to see her， but very feverish and unwell．The doctor came， and after examining his patient， advised that she should stay in bed and take some medicine．Elizabeth stayed with her all day，looking after her，and the Bingley sisters also spent some time in the patient's room．However，in the afternoon， when it was time for Eliza- beth to leave，Jane seemed so upset that Miss Bingley was obliged to invite Elizabeth to stay at Netherfield for the present，and a servant was sent to Longbourn to inform the Bennet family and bring back some clothes．</p>
<p>伊丽莎白几乎马上被带到了姐姐的卧室，对此她很满意。在那里，她发现简见到她很愉快，可是发着高烧，情况很糟糕。医生来了，给病人检查过之后，建议她卧床休息，吃点药。伊丽莎白全天和她呆在一起，照料她，彬格莱姐妹俩也在病房里呆了一段时间。可是，到了下午，伊丽莎白该走的时候，简似乎感到十分焦躁不安，彬格莱小姐就不得不邀请伊丽莎白先呆在尼日斐并派一个仆人到浪搏恩通知班纳特家，再带回些衣服。</p>
<p>That evening Elizabeth went down to dinner，leaving Jane in bed in her room．She noticed the Bingley sisters’apparent con- cern for Jane change to indifference in a few moments， and knew she had been right to dislike them at first sight． Mr Bingley， indeed， was the only one of the group whose behaviour she was satisfied with． His anxiety for Jane was evident， and his politeness towards herself most pleasing． But the others， she felt， treated her as an unwelcome guest． Miss Bingley was con- centrating all her attention on Mr Darcy， and Mrs Hurst also joined in their conversation，while Mr Hurst was only interest- ed in eating， drinking and playing cards．</p>
<p>那天晚上，伊丽莎白下去吃饭，留简一个人在屋里躺在床上。她注意到彬格莱姐妹对简明显的关怀之情不一会儿就变成一片漠然，这时她认识到第一次见面就讨厌她们的感觉是正确的。说实在的，这几个人中只有彬格莱先生一个人的表现使她感到满意。他为简感到焦虑是很显然的，对自己的礼貌也是很令人满意的。但是，她感到其他的人把她当成不受欢迎的客人。彬格莱小姐整个心思都在达西身上，赫斯特夫人也参加到他们的谈话里去，赫斯特先生只对吃饭、喝酒、打牌感兴趣。</p>
<p>When Elizabeth left the room after dinner to see if Jane needed anything，Miss Bingley at once began to criticize her．</p>
<p>伊丽莎白吃过饭离开房间，去看简是不是需要什么。这时，彬格莱小姐马上开始说她的坏话。</p>
<p>‘What bad manners she has！She's both proud， and lacking in politeness to her superiors！She has no conversation， no ele- gance and no beauty！’</p>
<p>“她多没教养啊！又傲慢又不知道尊重上等人！她不跟人攀谈，不爱打扮，相貌平平！”</p>
<p>Mrs Hurst agreed， and added，‘She has no good qualities，ex- cept that she's an excellent walker． I’ll never forget her ap- pearance this morning．She really looked almost wild．’</p>
<p>赫斯特夫人也这么看，并补充说：“她没有什么好品质，只有一样，就是能走路。我永远忘不了她今天早上的模样。就跟疯了差不多。”</p>
<p>‘She did indeed，Louisa．How silly of her to come at all！Why must she run around the countryside，just because her sis- ter has a cold？ Her hair looked so untidy！ And her dress！Simply covereb in mud！’</p>
<p>“她确实如此，露易莎。她到这儿来真是太傻了，在野地里来回跑什么，就因为她姐姐着点儿凉吗？看她的头发，乱糟糟的，不堪入目！她的衣服，简直是用泥抹了一遍！”</p>
<p>‘I must say，’said Bingley，‘I didn't notice any of that．I thought she looked remarkably attractive when she arrived this morning．</p>
<p>“我说句话，”彬格莱先生说，“你们所说的我都没有看见。我觉得她今天早上来到的时候，看起来很有魅力。”</p>
<p>‘You observed her wild appearance，I'm sure，Mr Darcy，’said Miss Bingley，‘and I imagine you wouldn't wish your sis- ter to make such a show of herself．’</p>
<p>“达西先生，你肯定看到她今天早上的疯癫劲了，”彬格莱小姐说，“我想你不会希望你的妹妹这样丢人现眼吧。”</p>
<p>‘Certainly not．’</p>
<p>“当然不会。”</p>
<p>‘Walking four or five kilometres，whatever it was，up to her ankles in mud， and alone， quite alone！It seems to me to show a dreadful sort of independence， a country girl's indifference to what is acceptable．’</p>
<p>“不管怎么说，走了四五公里，烂泥没到了脚脖子，又是一个人，没有一个人做伴！我似乎看到一种可怕的独立性，一种乡下女孩对什么该做、什么不该做的漠视。”</p>
<p>‘I think it shows a very pleasing affection for her sister，’said Bingley．</p>
<p>“我想这表现出对姐姐的手足之情，是难能可贵的。”彬格莱说。</p>
<p>‘I'm afraid， Mr Darcy，’whispered Miss Bingley，‘that this adventure has rather lessened your admiration of her fine eyes．’</p>
<p>“达西先生，”彬格莱小姐小声说，“恐怕她这次冒险削弱了你对她眼睛的喜爱吧。”</p>
<p>‘Not at all，’he replied．‘They were brightened by the ex- ercise．’</p>
<p>“一点没有，”他回答说，“一运动眼睛反而更加明亮了。”</p>
<p>After a short pause， Mrs Hurst began again．‘I have a great liking for Jane Bennet．She is really a very sweet girl， and I wish with all my heart she were well married．But with such a father and mother， and with such vulgar relations， I'm afraid there's no chance of it．’</p>
<p>稍作停顿之后，赫斯特夫人又开始了。“我很喜欢简&middot;班纳特，她真是个很可爱的女孩，我真心希望她能找个好男人。可是，父母是那样，亲戚又那么粗俗，我想她是不会有这样的机会的。”</p>
<p>‘I think the Bennet girls have an uncle who's a lawyer in Meryton．’</p>
<p>“我想班纳特家的姑娘有个姨父在麦里屯做律师。”</p>
<p>‘Yes，and they have another who owns shops in Cheapside！Such a nice part of London！’Both the sisters laughed．</p>
<p>“是的，她们还有个舅舅在齐普赛开店呢。伦敦的这个地方真不错！”姐妹俩纵声大笑。</p>
<p>‘If they had enough uncles to fill Cheapside，’cried Bing- ley，‘it wouldn't make them any less charming！’</p>
<p>“假使她们父母的兄弟多得能把齐普赛塞满，”彬格莱大声说，“那也不会使她们的魅力有任何减少！”</p>
<p>‘But it must considerably lessen their chances of marrying men of any position in the world，’replied Darcy．</p>
<p>“可是这必将大大减少她们同世界上任何有地位的男人结婚的机会，”达西回答道。</p>
<p>Bingley did not answer，but his sisters agreed enthusiastically， and continued mocking their dear friend's vul- gar relations for some time．</p>
<p>彬格莱没有回答，可是他的姐妹们兴高采烈地表示同意，并继续嘲笑了一会儿亲爱的朋友的下贱亲戚。</p>
<p>Late in the evening， when Elizabeth was satisfied that Jane was asleep， she felt she ought to go downstairs again．She found the party in the sitting-room， playing cards， but although they invited her to join in their game， she refused politely， and picked up a book to read．</p>
<p>深夜，伊丽莎白看到简睡着了，心里很高兴，她觉得应该再到楼下去。她发现那些人在客厅打牌，虽然他们邀请她一起玩，可是她有礼貌地拒绝了，并拿起一本书读了起来。</p>
<p>‘I can fetch you more books to read，if you wish，’offered Bingley，‘but I'm afraid I haven't got a large library．Unlike you，I'm too lazy to spend much time reading．’</p>
<p>“如果你愿意读，我可以给你多拿几本来，”彬格莱提出，“不过，恐怕我没有个大图书馆。不像你，我太懒，不读什么书。”</p>
<p>‘What a delightful library you have at Pemberley，Mr Darcy！’said Miss Bingley．‘And what a beautiful house it is！Charles，when you buy your house，I hope it will be even half as lovely as Pemberley．’</p>
<p>“达西先生，你在彭伯里的图书馆多么令人赏心悦目啊！”彬格莱小姐说。“那幢房子多漂亮啊！查尔斯，你买房子时，我希望有彭伯里的一半那么可爱就行了。”</p>
<p>‘I hope so too，’agreed Bingley．</p>
<p>“我也希望如此，”彬格莱附和道。</p>
<p>‘And your dear sister， Mr Darcy？ I expect she's grown since the spring． I want so much to see her again！I've never met anyone who delighted me so much！Such an appearance，such manners！And so extremely accomplished for her age！’</p>
<p>“还有，你那可爱的小妹怎么样了，达西先生？我估计春天以来她又长高了吧！我多想再见到她呀！我见过的人还没有哪个像她那样使我感到快活！她的相貌，她的风度！还有小小年纪就多才多艺！”</p>
<p>‘I'm always surprised，’said Bingley，‘to find how very ac- complished all young ladies are． How do they have the time and patience to learn all these skills？’</p>
<p>“我总觉得奇怪，”彬格莱说，“我发现如今的年轻小姐们都是多才多艺。她们哪儿来的时间，哪儿有耐心来学习这些技艺呢？”</p>
<p>‘Certainly people use the word“accomplished”too loosely，’said Darcy，‘but I am far from agreeing with you about ladies in general．I cannot boast of knowing more than six who are really accomplished．’</p>
<p>“当然是人们把‘多才多艺’这个词用滥了，”达西说，“不过，你把小姐们都称为多才多艺，我则完全不敢苟同。真正多才多艺的据我所知不过五六个人。”</p>
<p>‘Then，’said Elizabeth，‘your idea of an accomplished woman must include a great many qualities．’</p>
<p>“那样的话，”伊丽莎白说，“你所谓的多才多艺一定要具备多种优良品质才行啦。”</p>
<p>‘Yes， a great many．’</p>
<p>“是的，要有多种优良品质。”</p>
<p>‘Oh！Certainly，’cried his faithful assistant，Miss Bingley，‘an accomplished woman must have a thorough knowledge of music，singing， drawing， dancing and modern languages， and besides this， a certain something in her manner of walking， in her voice and in her behaviour．’</p>
<p>“啊！当然啦，”他忠实的帮腔者彬格莱小姐大声说道，“多才多艺的人必须通晓音乐、演唱、绘画、舞蹈和现代语言，除此之外，还要注意行姿、嗓音和举止。”</p>
<p>‘All this she must possess，’added Darcy，‘and something more solid，the improvement of her mind by wide reading．’</p>
<p>“所有这些都必须具备，”达西补充道，“除此之外，还有更实在的，那就是要博览群书，扩大视野。”</p>
<p>‘I'm no longer surprised at your knowing only six accom- plished women，’said Elizabeth．‘I rather wonder at your knowing any．I've never seen such elegance， and intelligence，and knowledge， as you describe， in one woman．’</p>
<p>“这么说来，你只知道五六个多才多艺的人，就不足为怪了，”伊丽莎白说。“你竟然还知道有这样的人存在，我感到相当惊讶。我还从来没有见过你所谓的集优雅、智慧和知识于一身的女人呢。”</p>
<p>Mrs Hurst and Miss Bingley were both protesting loudly that they knew many women like this， when Mr Hurst called their attention back to the card game．As this meant an end to the conversation， Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room．</p>
<p>赫斯特太太和彬格莱小姐大声抗议说，她们认识很多这样的妇女。这时，赫斯特先生叫她们不要分心，注意玩牌。因为这就意味着谈话的结束，所以，伊丽莎白不久就离开了房间。</p>
<p>‘Miss Elizabeth Bennet，’said Miss Bingley to Darcy，‘is one of those women who try to appear attractive to men by un- dervaluing other women． I think that's a mean trick．’</p>
<p>“伊丽莎白&middot;班纳特小姐，”彬格莱小姐对达西说，“是那种贬低别人抬高自己以吸引男人的女人。我以为这是很卑鄙的。”</p>
<p>‘It is true，’said Darcy，‘that there is meanness in all the tricks used by ladies to attract men．’</p>
<p>“你说得对，”达西说，“女人用来吸引男人的所有花招都是卑鄙的。”</p>
<p>Miss Bingley was not satisfied enough with this answer to continue the conversation．</p>
<p>彬格莱小姐对这个回答不够满意，谈话就此中断了。</p>
<p>The next morning Elizabeth was glad to be able to inform Mr Bingley and his sisters that Jane was very much better．</p>
<p>第二天早晨，伊丽莎白很高兴地通知彬格莱先生和她的姐妹说，简的状况大为改善。</p>
<p>In spite of this improvement， however， she asked for her mother to be sent for， as she wanted Mrs Bennet's opinion of Jane's state of health．Soon after breakfast， therefore， Mrs Bennet， accompanied by her two youngest daughters， reached Netherfield．</p>
<p>不过，虽然病情大为好转，伊丽莎白还是想让人叫母亲过来，听听她对于简的健康状况的意见。于是，早饭过后不久，班纳特太太在两个小女儿的陪同下，到达了尼日斐。</p>
<p>Elizabeth， although relieved to hear that her mother did not think Jane's illness serious，began to regret asking her to come， when she saw the Bingley sisters smiling at Mrs Bennet's remarks．Elizabeth blushed for her mother， who could not help showing her lack of intelligence and common sense in every- thing she said．</p>
<p>听到母亲说简的病不要紧，伊丽莎白松了口气。尽管如此，当她看到彬格莱姐妹取笑她母亲说的话时，她开始后悔不该叫母亲过来。伊丽莎白为母亲感到脸红，因为母亲所说的每句话都不自觉地表现出她缺乏头脑和起码的见识。</p>
<p>Kitty and Lydia made an equally had impression．They had been whispering together， when suddenly Lydia，who was an attractive， confident， well-grown girl of fifteen， pushed herself rudely forward．She begged Mr Bingley to hold a ball at Netherfield． With his usual politeness， Mr Bingley promised he would，but Elizabeth saw his sisters exchanging meaningful glances．She was quite glad when her mother and sisters left．She and Jane were to stay another night at Netherfield， to allow Jane to recover completely．</p>
<p>吉蒂和丽迪亚给人的印象也一样坏。她们俩一直在窃窃私语，可是突然那个迷人的、充满自信的、15岁就发育成熟的丽迪亚十分无礼地出了一下风头。她恳求彬格莱先生在尼日斐举行一次舞会。彬格莱先生像往常一样，彬彬有礼地答应说他会举办的，不过伊丽莎白看到他的姐妹别有用心地交换了一下眼色。母亲和妹妹走了以后，她感到很高兴。她和简要在尼日斐再呆一个晚上，等到简完全恢复后再走。</p>
<p>That evening Elizabeth appeared again in the sitting-room．She could not avoid noticing how frequently Mr Darcy's eyes were fixed on her， but as she felt sure that so great a man could not possibly admire her，she assumed that when he looked at her， he was criticizing her in some way．This thought did not cause her any pain， as she liked him too little to care for his ap- proval．</p>
<p>那天晚上，伊丽莎白再次来到起居室。她不可避免地注意到达西先生的目光频繁地落在自己身上。不过，她觉得，这样一位大人物是不可能爱慕她的，所以，她就假定他注视她时，是在挑她的毛玻这种想法并没有使她感到痛苦，因为她不爱他，所以并不在乎他心里怎么想。</p>
<p>In the conversations she had with him， she spoke in her usual slightly mocking manner， rather expecting to offend him，but was surprised by the quiet politeness of his replies．Darcy had never before been so charmed by any woman．He really be- lieved that if she did not have such vulgar relations， he might be in danger of falling in love with her． Miss Bingley saw or suspected enough to be jealous， and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane was increased by her wish to get rid of Elizabeth．</p>
<p>她与他交谈时，总是带点儿讥讽的口吻，有点期望能惹他生气，但他的回答却出人意料地心平气和和彬彬有礼。达西以前还从来没有被哪个女人这样迷住过。他真心认为，要不是她出身这么卑微，他还真有爱上她的危险。彬格莱小姐的所见所疑足以使她醋性大发，由于希望摆脱掉伊丽莎白，她盼望好友简早日康复的焦虑心情更是与日俱增。</p>
<p>Fortunately perhaps， for almost everyone at Netherfield，Elizabeth and her sister， who was now quite recovered， were returning home the next day． Only Mr Bingley showed real sorrow at this， and was concerned that Jane might not be fit enough to travel． Mr Darcy was quite relieved， and determined that no sign of admiration for Elizabeth should escape him now． Miss Bingley's politeness to Elizabeth， as well as her af- fection for Jane， increased rapidly as the moment of departure approached，and she was able to say goodbye to them with many warm expressions of friendliness and a promise to visit them very soon．</p>
<p>伊丽莎白和她姐姐（现在已经基本康复）第二天就要回家了，这对于尼日斐几乎所有人来讲，也许都是求之不得的。只有彬格莱先生对她们的离别感到真正的难过，并且担心简还没有完全康复，不宜出门。达西先生松了口气，并决定此时此刻不能流露出对伊丽莎白有半点爱慕之情。随着离别时刻的到来，彬格莱小姐对伊丽莎白的客气程度以及对简的感情迅速增加，到与她们道别时，竟能说出许多令人心里暖烘烘的友好之辞来，她还许诺不久将对她们进行一次拜访。</p>
<p>Mr Bennet was glad to welcome his eldest daughters home again，as he had felt their absence from the family circle，but Mrs Bennet， who had hoped they would stay much longer， was quite disappointed to see them come back in such a short time．</p>
<p>班纳特先生见到两个年长些的女儿回家来，自然十分高兴，因为她们不在时，他总觉得家里少了点儿什么。可是班纳特太太本希望她们多住些日子，看到她们这么早回来，心里相当失望。</p><a href='3.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
