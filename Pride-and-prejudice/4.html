<p><b>4 伊丽莎白巧遇韦翰先生 </b></p>
<p>When later that morning Lydia suggested walking to Meryton to see some of the officers，all her sisters ex- cept Mary agreed to accompany her．Even Mr Collins went with them，encouraged by Mr Bennet，who was by now most anxious to have some time to himself．During their walk，the girls listened politely to Mr Collins'self-important speeches， but as soon as they entered Meryton，the younger ones no longer eved pretended to be interested in his conversation，but looked eagerly around in search of the officers．</p>
<p>那天上午晚些时候，丽迪亚提议步行到麦里屯去见几位军官，除了玛丽，几位姐姐都同意陪她去。甚至柯林斯先生也去了。是班纳特先生鼓动他去的，他现在急切地需要清静一会儿。在路上，姑娘们很有礼貌地听着柯林斯先生妄自尊大的演讲，可是，她们一进入麦里屯，几位年龄小的便四处张望，搜索军官的影子，连听他讲话的样子都不装了。</p>
<p>Just then all the young ladies noticed a very gentleman-like young man，whom they had never seen before，walking down the street with an officer they knew．They were all wondering who the handsome stranger could be，when the officer came up to them to greet them．He asked permission to introduce his friend，whose name was Mr Wickham，and who had apparently arrived recently from London，to become an officer in the regi- ment．This was exactly as it should be，because the young man only needed an officer's uniform to become completely charm- ing．He was very good-looking，with a very pleasant，sociable manner，and after the introductions，conversation flowed most enjoyably in the little group．They were still standing and talk- ing happily together，when they heard the sound of horses，and saw Darcy and Bingley riding down the street．The two gentlemen came straight towards the ladies to greet them．Bin- gley was clearly most interested in Jane Bennet，and started talking particuarly to her．Darcy，however，was just determin- ing not to look at Elizabeth，when he suddenly noticed the stranger．By chance Elizabeth saw Darcy's and Wickham's faces at the moment when they caught sight of each other，and she was astonished at the effect of the meeting．Both changed colour，one white，the other red．After a few moments Mr Wickham touched his hat，and Mr Darcy nodded very slightly． What could this mean？It was impossible to imagine，and it was impossible not to wish to know．</p>
<p>正在这时，所有的年轻小姐都注意到了一位风度翩翩的年轻人，这个人她们以前从未见过，现在正和一位她们认识的军官沿着大街往前走。她们正在纳闷这位英俊的陌生人是谁，那位军官走过来和她们打招呼。军官获得允许之后介绍了他的朋友韦翰先生。他显然是新近从伦敦过来的，调到团里当军官。看来军官就理应他当，因为这个年轻人只需配上军官制服，便能使姑娘们完全为之倾倒。此人一表人才，谈吐文雅，待人随和，互相介绍完毕之后，这个小团体就充满了欢声笑语。他们正站在一块愉快地交谈，这时他们听到一阵马蹄声，看见达西和彬格莱骑着马沿街走来。两位先生径直来到姑娘们面前与她们打招呼。彬格莱显然对简&middot;班纳特最感兴趣，开始跟她一个人谈话。而达西正在下决心不去看伊丽莎白时，突然注意到了那位陌生人。达西和韦翰目光相撞时，伊丽莎白正好看到他们两人的脸色。她对两人相遇时的表现感到惊讶不已。两人脸色都变了，一个白，一个红。片刻之后，韦翰先生碰了碰帽子以示行礼，达西先生则轻微地点了点头。这会是什么意思？不可能想象得出来，而且也不可能不想去探个究竟。</p>
<p>In another moment Mr Bingley，who did not seem to have noticed what had happened，said goodbye and rode away with Mr Darcy．The two officers accompanied the young ladies to Mrs Philips’house，but did not go in，in spite of Lydia's re- peated invitations．Mrs Philips was always glad to see her nieces，and welcomed Mr Collins most politely when he was in- troduced to her．She did not，however，have any more informa- tion for the girls about the agreeable Mr Wickham．</p>
<p>彬格莱先生似乎没有注意到刚才发生的事，过了一会儿便道了别，与达西先生骑着马走了。两位军官陪着几位小姐到了菲力普斯家，虽然丽迪亚再三邀请，但他们没有进去。菲力普斯太太见到外甥女总是十分高兴，听她们介绍了柯林斯先生后，很客气地向他表示欢迎。可是，关于那随和的韦翰先生，她也不能给姑娘们提供更多的情况。</p>
<p>‘But I tell you what，my dears，’she said brightly，‘I'm giving a little supper party for some of the officers tomorrow． I’ll ask Mr Philips to visit Mr Wickham and invite him to come too．Will you all come as well？’</p>
<p>“不过，我告诉你们怎么办，孩子们，”她喜气洋洋地说，“明天我请几位军官吃顿晚饭，我让菲力普斯先生去拜访一下韦翰先生，也请他过来。你们大家也都来吗？”</p>
<p>The girls were delighted and agreed at once to this arrange- ment，and the whole group walked back to Longbourn，happily discussing the enjoyable evening they were going to have．Mr Collins had been very impressed with Mrs Philips’politeness， and when they reached Longbourn，he complimented Mrs Ben- net on her sister's elegance and charming manners．</p>
<p>姑娘们兴高采烈，马上同意了这个安排，这一些人便又步行返回浪搏恩，一路谈论着将要度过的愉快的夜晚。柯林斯先生对于菲力普斯太太的彬彬有礼印象深刻，到达浪搏思后，便向班纳特太太称赞她妹妹迷人绰约的风姿。</p>
<p>The next evening the carriage took him and his five cousins to Meryton，and the girls had the pleasure of hearing，as they entered the hall，that Mr Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation，and was at that moment in the house．</p>
<p>第二天晚上，柯林斯先生和五个表妹乘马车到达麦里屯，姑娘们一进客厅，就听说韦翰接受了姨夫的邀请，而且已经驾到，感到十分高兴。</p>
<p>When Mr Collins was shown into the sitting-room，and had time to look around and admire it，he said immediately to Mrs Philips，‘Madam，I must compliment you on the size and furni- ture of this room Really，I could almost imagine myself in the smaller summer breakfast-room at Rosings！’</p>
<p>柯林斯先生被领到起居室，四下张望并欣赏了一会儿，马上对菲力普斯太太说：“夫人，您的房间如此宽敞，家具如此精美，我必须向您表示祝贺。实际上我几乎可以想象出我正身处罗新斯小型的夏日早餐厅！”</p>
<p>This remark did not at first please his hostess very much， but when she heard from him what Rosings was，and who its owner was，and how much Lady Latherine's furniture cost，she realized what a great compliment it was．During the evening Mr Collins found Mrs Philips a kind and attentive listener， which was fortunate，as the Bennet girls could not bring them- selves to listen to him any longer．</p>
<p>这句话起初并没有使女主人感到十分高兴，可是，当她得知罗新斯是什么、它的主人是谁、凯瑟琳夫人的家具多么昂贵时，她才认识到刚才的话是何等的恭维。那天晚上，柯林斯先生发现菲力普斯太太很和蔼，听别人讲话很专心。这一点使他很幸运，因为班纳特家的姑娘们已经再也耐不住性子听他讲了。</p>
<p>All the ladies were impatient to see Mr Wickham，and when he came into the room，he appeared far more charming and gentlemanly than any of the officers present．He was the lucky man towards whom almost every female eye turned，and Eliza- beth was the lucky woman beside whom he finally took his seat．His pleasant way of making conversation made her feel that he could talk interestingly about anything．As he did not play cards，which some of the party were doing，he stayed talk- ing to Elizabeth for a large part of the evening．She hoped he would tell her how he knew Mr Darcy，but she dared not men- tion that gentleman．Luckily，however，Mr Wickham himself began to talk about it，although in a rather hesitating manner．</p>
<p>所有的小姐都迫不及待地等着见到韦翰先生。他走进了屋里，显得比在场的任何军官都更有魅力，更有绅士风度。韦翰是当天最幸运的男子，差不多每个女人的目光都转向了他；伊丽莎白是最幸运的女子，因为韦翰终于在她身边坐了下来。他谈话的愉快方式使伊丽莎白感觉到他可以饶有兴趣地谈论任何事情。有些人在打牌，他不打牌，所以，大半个晚上都在与伊丽莎白聊天。伊丽莎白希望他能告诉她他是如何认识达西先生的，可是她不敢提起那个男人。不过，韦翰碰巧自己提起了这个话头，虽然讲起来有些迟疑。</p>
<p>‘Netherfield is quite near Meryton，I suppose？How long has—has Mr Darcy been staying there？’</p>
<p>“尼日斐离麦里屯很近吧，我想是？达西先生在那儿呆了有——多长时间了？”</p>
<p>‘He has been there about a month，’replied Elizabeth．Un- willing to let the matter drop，she added，‘He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire，I understand．’</p>
<p>“大约有一个月了，”伊丽莎白回答说。为了不转移话题，她又补充说：“据我所知，他在德比郡有大量财产。”</p>
<p>‘Yes，’replied Wickham，‘his income is ten thousand a year at least．I know more about him than most people，as I have been closely connected with his family since childhood．’</p>
<p>“是的，”韦翰回答说，“他的年收入至少一万英镑。提起他，我比一般人都更清楚，因为我从小就跟他家关系密切。”</p>
<p>Elizabeth could only look surprised．</p>
<p>伊丽莎白惊讶不已。</p>
<p>‘You might well be surprised，Miss Bennet，at my saying that，after noticing，as you probably did，the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday．Do you know Mr Darcy well？’</p>
<p>“班纳特小姐，你昨天看到——可能会看到——我们见面时冷冰冰的样子，今天又听了我这番话，我想你会感到很奇怪的。你和达西先生很熟吗？”</p>
<p>‘As well as I ever wish to！’cried Elizabeth．‘I've spent four days in the same house as him，and I consider him very disagreeable．’</p>
<p>“我也只希望跟他这么熟就足够了！”伊丽莎白大声说，“我们在同一屋檐下生活了四天，我觉得这个人很讨厌。”</p>
<p>‘I've known him too long and too well to judge fairly whether he's disagreeable or not．But I believe most people would be astonished by your opinion．’</p>
<p>“我们的交往太久太深，使我不能公平地判断他是否讨厌。可是我觉得多数人都会对你的评价感到震惊。”</p>
<p>‘He is not at all liked here in Hertfordshire．Everybody is disgusted with his pride．You won't find him praised by any- one．’</p>
<p>“他在哈福德郡这儿可一点也不讨人喜欢。大家对他的高傲都感到恶心。你不会听到任何人赞扬他。”</p>
<p>‘I can't pretend to be sorry that he is valued as he deserves， but with him I believe it doesn't often happen．The world is blinded by his fortune and importance，or frightened by his proud behaviour，and sees him only as he chooses to be seen．’After a pause Wickham added，‘I wonder if he's likely to stay at Netherfield much longer．’</p>
<p>“他得到这样的评价是罪有应得，我对此表示难过也不是装出来的。但对于他，人们一般不会作出你这样的评价。因为世人都被他的财产和地位蒙住了眼睛，或者被他的傲慢行为吓懵了，只能是他摆出什么样子，大家就看什么样子。”韦翰顿了一下，接着说，“我不知道他是否可能在尼日斐长期呆下去。”</p>
<p>‘I don't know at all，but I hope his presence won't stop you becoming an officer in the regiment here．’</p>
<p>“我一点都不清楚，不过我希望他在这儿不会影响你在这边的兵团成为军官。”</p>
<p>‘Oh no！I won't be driven away by Mr Darcy．If he wishes to avoid seeing me，he must go．The reason I have for avoiding him is one I could easily make public to the whole world—he has treated me very badly．His late father，Miss Bennet，was one of the best men who ever lived，and the most faithful friend I ever had．And whenever I'm with this Mr Darcy，I think of his father with the most painful regret．Mr Darcy has behaved wickedly to wards me，but I could forgive him anything except the insult to his father's memory．’</p>
<p>“噢，不会的！我不会被达西先生赶走的。如果他想避免见到我，他应当走。我不想见他的理由我可以轻易地向全世界公开——他待我很糟糕。班纳特小姐，他已故的父亲是世界上最好的人之一，也是我所有朋友中最忠诚的。每当我和现在的达西先生在一起时，我一想到他的父亲，便会充满了最令人痛心的遗憾。达西先生对我十分恶毒，但是，我一切都可以原谅他，就是不能原谅他辱没了他先父的声名。”</p>
<p>Elizabeth was fascinated，and listened eagerly，but did not like to ask any questions．Mr Wickham began to speak more generally about Meryton and the charming people he had met there．</p>
<p>伊丽莎白被强烈地吸引住了，急切地听着，但不想问什么问题。韦翰先生开始泛泛而谈麦里屯和他在那里遇到的轶闻趣事。</p>
<p>In fact，that's why I was tempted to join the regiment．I'd heard that Meryton society is most agreeable．Society，I confess，is necessary to me．I have been a disappointed man， you see．I did not intend to join the army at all．The Church ought to have been my profession，and I should at this moment have a comfortable income as a Derbyshire rector，if the gentle- man we were speaking of just now had wished it．’</p>
<p>“实际上，这也正是我为什么会被吸引到这里参军的缘故。我早就听说麦里屯的社交圈子是十分令人愉快的。我承认，社交对我是必要的，你知道，我是一个生活无望的人。我原来并不打算参军。我应当做牧师。如果我们刚才谈到的那位先生希望的话，我现在应当是德比郡的一名教区长了，有一笔丰厚的收入。”</p>
<p>‘Indeed！’</p>
<p>“是吗！”</p>
<p>‘Yes—Mr Darcy's father had always been very fond of me， and intended to give me the post of rector of Pemberley．But unfortunately，after his death，when the post became vacant，it was given to someone else．’</p>
<p>“是的——达西先生的父亲一直很疼爱我，打算把彭伯里的牧师职位留给我。可是，遗憾的是，他死后，牧师的职位空缺时，却给了别人。”</p>
<p>‘No！’cried Elizabeth，horrified．‘But how could that hap- pen？Why didn't you get legal advice，and claim what was rightfully yours？’</p>
<p>“不！”伊丽莎白感到震惊，叫了起来。“可是那怎么可能呢？你为什么不寻求法律帮助，请求获得自己的合法权益？”</p>
<p>Mr Darcy's father had not stated his wish in writing．A man of honour could not have doubted his intention，but Mr Darcy chose to treat it as a recommendation only．I really can not accuse myself of having done anything to deserve to lose the post．The fact is，he hates me．I think he was jealous of his father's affection for me，which annoyed him from the begin- ning．</p>
<p>“达西先生的父亲没有立书面遗嘱。正直的人是不会怀疑他的意图的，但是达西先生却把它理解为仅仅是一种推荐意见。我确实没有做错什么事，让我丧失这样的职位。事实上是他恨我。我想是他父亲对我的疼爱使他心存妒意，使他一开始就耿耿于怀。”</p>
<p>‘This is very shocking！I hadn't thought Mr Darcy as bad as this，although I've never liked him．I assumed he felt superi- or to everyone else，but did not suspect him of behaving in such a wicked，unjust，inhuman way！’</p>
<p>“真是骇人听闻！虽然我从来没有喜欢过达西先生．可是从来没有想到过他有那样坏。我只是想，他总觉得自己高人一等，可是从来没有怀疑过他会这样邪恶，这样不公正，这样无情！”</p>
<p>‘We grew up together at Pemberley，you know．My father gave up all his time to take care of the Pemberley farms，and was greatly appreciated as a close friend by the late Mr Darcy， who promised just before my father's death to provide for me． The present Mr Darcy did not choose to respect that promise．’</p>
<p>“你知道，我们俩在彭伯里一块长大。我父亲把毕生的精力都用于照料彭伯里的农场，因此，已故的达西先生对我父亲十分感激，把父亲看作挚友，就在我父亲临终前，他许诺以后供养我。现在的达西先生没有信守那个诺言。”</p>
<p>‘How strange that Mr Darcy's pride has not made him help you！Surely he's too proud to wish to appear dishonest— which is what I must call him．’</p>
<p>“我真感到奇怪，达西先生既然有那样的自尊心，为什么不能帮你一把！确实，他是傲慢过度，不愿显得不诚实——我不能不称之为不诚实。”</p>
<p>‘He's certainly very proud—proud of his position，his family，his father，and his sister，too，you know．’</p>
<p>“他当然很傲慢——因为自己的地位、家庭、父亲，还有妹妹，你知道。”</p>
<p>‘What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy？’</p>
<p>“达西小姐是什么样的人？”</p>
<p>He shook his head．‘It gives me pain to criticize a Darcy．But she's too much like her brother—very，very proud．She's a handsome girl of about fifteen or sixteen，and，I understand， extremely accomplished．’</p>
<p>他摇了摇头。“批评达西家的人使我感到痛心。但是，她太像她哥哥了——非常、非常傲慢。她是个十五六岁的漂亮小姐，据我所知，很有才气。”</p>
<p>‘I am astonished at Mr Darcy's close friendship with Mr Bingley！How can Mr Bingley，who seems so charming and kind，be friendly with such a man？’</p>
<p>“我对达西先生和彬格莱先生的亲密关系感到震惊！彬格莱先生看起来那么可爱，那么和蔼，怎么会跟这样的人交朋友？”</p>
<p>‘I don't know Mr Bingley at all，but Mr Darcy can be a pleasant companion if he thinks it worthwhile．’</p>
<p>“我根本不认识彬格莱先生，可是达西先生如果认为值得，也会和颜悦色地和人相处。”</p>
<p>Just then they were joined by some of the others，and the conversation became more general．When Mr Collins was talk- ing to Mrs Philips about his patron，Mf Wickham looked quickly in his direction，and then asked Elizabeth，‘Does your cousin know Lady Catherine de Bourgh very well？’</p>
<p>这时，另外几个人加入了他们的谈话，话题就分散了。当柯林斯先生对菲力普斯太太谈起他的保护人时，韦翰先生迅速朝那个方向望了一下，然后问伊丽莎白：“你表兄和凯瑟琳&middot;德&middot;包尔夫人很熟吗？”</p>
<p>‘I don't think he has known her for long，but she has re- cently given him the post of rector of Hunsford．’</p>
<p>“我想他们不会相识多久，但是，她最近把汉斯福的教区长职务给了他。”</p>
<p>‘Perhaps you know that Lady Catherine is the present Mr Darcy's aunt？I believe she is planning to marry herdaughter，who will inherit a fortune，to Mr Darcy．’</p>
<p>“你也许知道凯瑟琳夫人就是现在的达西先生的姨妈？我想她打算把她的女儿嫁给达西先生。她女儿会继承一大笔财产。”</p>
<p>This information made Elizabeth smile，as she thought of poor Miss Bingley's efforts to attract Mr Darcy，which might all be in vain．The supper party came to an end，and Elizabeth went away with her head full of Mr Wickham．She could think of nothing but him，and what he had told her，all the way home．</p>
<p>这话使伊丽莎白笑了，因为她想到了可怜的彬格莱小姐，她正在设法吸引达西先生，这下就可能是白费力气了。晚宴结束，伊丽莎白走了，满脑子都是韦翰先生。她一路上只是想着他，和他所说的话。</p>
<p>The next day she told Jane everything she had discussed with Mr Wickham．Jane listened with astonishment and con- cern．She could not believe that Mr Darcy could so little deserve Mr Bingley's friendship，and yet she did not want to doubt the truthfulness of such an agreeable young man as Mr Wickham． Elizabeth，however，felt sure that Mr Darcy was to blame．</p>
<p>第二天，她把与韦翰先生的谈话内容全部告诉了简。简又惊讶又关切地听着。她不敢相信达西先生竟如此辜负了彬格莱先生的一番情谊，又不愿怀疑像韦翰先生这样可爱的年轻人所说的话的真实性。但是，伊丽莎白坚信是达西先生的错。</p>
<p>That morning an invitation arrived at Longbourn．Mr Bing- ley had fixed the date for the ball he had promised to give at Netherfield，and it was to be on the following Tuesday．Every female in the Bennet family was looking forward to it，even Mary，who lifted her head from her book to say，unsmiling，‘As long as I have my mornings free for serious reading，I do not mind meeting people in the evenings．I consider some relax- ation and amusement is good for everybdy．’</p>
<p>那天上午，浪搏恩的一家受到了邀请。彬格莱先生已经确定了他答应在尼日斐举办的舞会的日子，就在下一个星期二。班纳特一家的所有女性都盼望着这一天，甚至玛丽也不例外。她从书上抬起头，绷着脸说：“只要我上午能空出来读些严肃的书籍，晚上和人交往一下我倒不介意。我认为适度的放松和娱乐对任何人都是有好处的。”</p>
<p>Elizabeth felt so cheerful at the thought of dancing with Mr Wickham that she made an unusual effort to speak kindly to Mr Collins．</p>
<p>伊丽莎白一想到将要与韦翰先生跳舞了，感到异常兴奋，竟然作出了不同寻常的努力，和柯林斯先生好声好气地说起话来。</p>
<p>‘Will you accept Mr Bingley's invitation，sir？And if you do，will you，as a priest，consider it right to dance？’</p>
<p>“先生，您接受彬格莱先生的邀请吗？如果您接受的话，作为一个牧师，您觉得跳舞合适吗？”</p>
<p>‘I shall certainly accept，and I am so far from objecting to dancing that I hope to have the honour of dancing with all my beautiful cousins．I take this opportunity of asking you，Miss Elizabeth，for the first two dances especially．’</p>
<p>“我当然接受。我不但不反对跳舞，而且还希望能有幸和所有漂亮的表妹跳上一曲。我借此机会邀请您，伊丽莎白小姐，特别和我跳前两支曲子。”</p>
<p>She was very surprised，and rather annoyed．She had hoped that Wickham would ask her for those dances，but now she would have Mr Collins instead！She could not refuse， however，and his request also worried her in another way．His manner to her seemed particularly flattering，which gave her the unwelcome idea that perhaps she had been chosen from among her sisters to be the rector of Hunsford's wife．As she observed the increasing number of compliments he paid to her beauty and character，she felt sure that he intended to propose marriage．For the moment，however，she decided to do nothing，but wait and see．</p>
<p>她很奇怪，还有点恼火。她希望韦翰请她跳前两场，可现在却要和柯林斯先生跳！可是，她不能拒绝，而且，他的请求使她感到担心的还有另外一点。他对她似乎特别殷勤，这给她一种不祥的感觉，即，在众姐妹中莫非是她被选中了做汉斯福教区长的妻子？她观察到他对她的美貌和性格奉承的次数越来越多，便肯定他想要求婚了。不过，目前她决定按兵不动，等着瞧。</p>
<p>On Tuesday evening，when Elizabeth entered the hall at Netherfield and looked in vain for Mr Wickham among the red coats gathered there，she was surprised and disappointed to see he was not present．She had never doubted he would come，and had dressed with more than her usual care，looking forward to winning his heart，which she knew was already partly hers．But she immediately suspected that Darcy had persuaded Bingley not to invite Wicham，and although she discovered from one of the officers that in fact Wickham had been invited，but had been called away on business，she felt sure Wickham had want- ed to avoid meeting Darcy，and blamed Darcy for this．As a re- sult，when Darcy greeted her，she was so annoyed with him that she could hardly reply politely．</p>
<p>星期二晚上，伊丽莎白走进了尼日斐的大厅，在穿着红色制服的军官中怎么也找不到韦翰先生。对他的缺席，伊丽莎白感到又奇怪，又失望。她从来没有想过他会不来，所以刻意打扮了一番，希望赢得他的欢心。她知道，他的心已有一部分属于她了。但是，她马上怀疑是达西说服了彬格莱不要邀请韦翰。尽管她从一位军官那里得知实际上韦翰受到了邀请，不过有公务而被抽走了，但她还是肯定，韦翰是想避免见到达西，因此又把罪责推到了达西身上。所以，当达西和她打招呼时，她对他很恼火，几乎不能有礼貌地回答他。</p>
<p>But she soon became more cheerful，and determined to enjoy the ball in spite of Wickham's absence．Unfortunately，the first two dances，with Mr Collins，were painfully embarrassing，as her cousin had no idea how to dance，and moved extremely awkwardly．She was relieved to leave him，and have the third dance with an officer，who gave her great pleasure by talking about Wickham and his popularity in the regiment．Alter this， she was very surprised to be approached by Mr Darcy and in- vited to dance．She was so astonished，in fact，that she accepted him without thinking，and found herself standing opposite him on the dance floor．‘What an honour for me，to be allowed to dance with Mr Darcy！’she thought．They danced for some time in silence，and then she made a remark．He replied，and was silent again．After a pause，she spoke again．</p>
<p>不过，不一会儿她就高兴起来了，并决心在韦翰缺场的情况下尽情享受这个舞会。遗憾的是，和柯林斯先生跳的前两场舞令人十分难堪，因为她的表兄根本不会跳舞，动作笨拙极了。跟他跳完以后，她松了口气。第三场是与一位军官跳的，这位军官谈到韦翰先生和他在团里的好人缘，使她获得很大乐趣。跳完之后，达西先生走近她并请她跳舞，她感到十分惊讶。实际上，她由于过分惊讶，来不及思考就接受了他的邀请，发现自己已经在舞池中站到了他的对面。“能获许同达西先生跳舞，这对我该是多大的荣幸呀！”她想。他们在沉默中跳了一会儿，伊丽莎白说了一句话，他回答完毕，又陷入了沉默。停顿了一下，她又开了口。</p>
<p>‘Now pou must say something，Mr Darcy．You could re- mark on the size of the room，or the number of couples．’</p>
<p>“达西先生，你现在得说话了。你可以谈谈房间的大小，或是有几对夫妇。”</p>
<p>He smiled．‘I’ll say whatever you wish me to say．’</p>
<p>他笑了。“你希望我说什么我就说什么。”</p>
<p>‘Very well．That reply will do for the moment．Perhaps soon I’ll observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones．But now we can be silent．Conversation needs to be ar- ranged In this way so that those people who don't enjoy talk- ing are not required to make any effort．’</p>
<p>“很好。这样的回答现在还可以。也许过不了多久，我会发现私人舞会比公共舞会令人愉快得多。不过，现在我们可以不说话了。安排谈话时不应当强求不喜欢谈话的人费劲去找话说。”</p>
<p>‘Are you referring to yourself，or are you thinking of me？’</p>
<p>“你是在说自己，还是在说我？”</p>
<p>‘Both，’said Elizabeth，smiling，‘because I think you and Iare similar．We're both unsociable and unwilling to speak，un- less we can astonish and impress the whole room．’</p>
<p>“两个都说，”伊丽莎白答道，面带微笑，“因为我觉得我和你很相似。我们都不合群，不愿讲话，除非能语惊四座。”</p>
<p>‘I am sure you aren't like that，’he answered．‘I cannot say whether I am，or not．You obviously think so．’</p>
<p>“我敢肯定你不是那样的人，”他回答道。“我说不上自己是或者不是。你显然认为我是那样的人。”</p>
<p>She said nothing．</p>
<p>她一言不发。</p>
<p>‘Do you and your sisters often go to Meryton？’he contin- ued．</p>
<p>“你们姊妹几个经常去麦里屯吗？”他继续问道。</p>
<p>‘We do，’she replied，and，unable to resist the temptation， she added，‘When you met us there last week，we had just been introduced to someone．’</p>
<p>“经常去，”她回答说，心里憋不住，又补充说，“你上周在那儿见到我们时，我们刚被介绍给别人。”</p>
<p>The effect was immediate．There was a new coldness in Dar- cy's expression．After a moment he said，with difficulty，‘Mr Wickham is so agreeable that he makes friends easily．Whether he can keep them is less certain．’</p>
<p>这句话立刻产生了效果。达西的脸上重新蒙上了一层阴冷的表情。停了片刻，他面露难色地说：“韦翰先生十分随和，结交朋友自然容易。至于能不能和朋友长久相处，那就很难说了。”</p>
<p>‘He has been unlucky enough to lose your friendship，’ replied Elizabeth sharply，‘and in a way which will cause him hardship all his life．’Darcy did not reply to this，and there was only time for a little more conversation before the dance ended．</p>
<p>“他真不走运，竟然失去了您的友谊，”伊丽莎白刻薄地说，“而且失去友谊的方式使他终生受罪。”达西没有回答，仅剩一点儿时间了，又谈了几句话，舞会就结束了。</p>
<p>Elizabeth went to find Jane，and listened with delight as she described her feelings for Bingley，and her confidence in his af- fection for her．But apart from Jane，it seemed to Elizabeth that if her family had made an agreement to appear as stupid as pos- sible during the ball，they could not have been more successful． First Mr Collins insisted on going to introduce himself to Mr Darcy，the nephew of his respected patron，and was received very coldly．Then，during supper，Mrs Bennet could not be pre- vented from talking very loudly to Lady Lucas about her great hopes of Jane's marriage to Bingley．Elizabeth blushed in em- barrassment when she realized that the Bingley sisters and Mr Darcy were able to hear．Finally，when some music was re- quired，Mary Bennet went confidently to the piano，and sang and played several songs，all rather badly．</p>
<p>伊丽莎白走过去找到了简，兴高采烈地听她描述自己对彬格莱的感情，以及她如何坚信彬格莱对她也一往情深。但伊丽莎白似乎觉得，假如当初她们全家已达成一致，认为在舞会上出洋相越多越好的话，那么，他们这次表演是再成功不过的了，只有简是个例外。首先是柯林斯先生坚持要把自己介绍给达西先生，即他尊敬的保护人的外甥。而得到的反应却十分冷淡。接着是吃晚饭时班纳特太太禁不住大声地同卢卡斯夫人谈论她很有希望将简嫁给彬格莱。伊丽莎白意识到彬格莱姐妹和达西先生能听到这些话时，羞得两颊通红。最后是需要演奏音乐时，玛丽&middot;班纳特走过去，充满自信地坐到钢琴前，演唱并弹奏了几首歌曲，都很糟糕。</p>
<p>The rest of the evening brought Elizabeth little amusement． She could not even go and talk to people she knew，as Mr Collins seemed determined to stay close by her side all evening． Fortunately，her good friend Charlotte Lucas occasionally gave her some relief，by kindly listening to some of Mr Collins’long speeches．At least Elizabeth did not have to talk to Mr Darcy any more．He often stood near her，quite alone，but did not come close enough to speak．</p>
<p>晚上剩下的时间没给伊丽莎白带来多少乐趣。她甚至不能脱身去和熟人说话，因为柯林斯先生似乎下定了决心整个晚上都傍在她身边形影不离。幸运的是，她的好友夏洛特&middot;卢卡斯偶尔让她松了口气，十分和善地听听柯林斯先生的某些长篇大论。伊丽莎白至少不用和达西先生说话了。他经常站在她附近，形单影只，但又不凑近了说话。</p>
<p>At the end of the evening it was obvious to Elizabeth that al- though her family had greatly enjoyed the ball，the Bingley sis- ters were eager for these particular guests to leave．Mr Collins， however，was enthusiastic in his praise of the Bingleys’hospi- tality，and Mrs Bennet invited the whole Bingley family to visit Longbourn as soon as possible．She was feeling very satisfied， convinced that in three or four months Jane would be married to Bingley．She was also sure that Elizabeth would marry Mr Collins．This was a good enough marriage for Elizabeth，who was her least favourite daughter，but not nearly as impressive as Jane's marriage to Bingley．</p>
<p>晚会结束时，伊丽莎白明显地感觉到，虽然她全家在舞会上玩得都很高兴，但彬格莱姐妹希望他们这批客人赶快离开。然而，柯林斯先生还兴致勃勃地称赞彬格莱全家的盛情款待，班纳特太太又邀请彬格莱全家尽早到浪搏恩去。她感到十分满意，确信三四个月以后，简就可以和彬格莱成婚了。她也肯定伊丽莎白将会嫁给柯林斯先生。对伊丽莎白这位她最不待见的女儿来说，这样的结合已经够可以的了，但是根本比不上简和彬格莱的婚姻来劲。</p><a href='5.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
