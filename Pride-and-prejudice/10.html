<p><b>10 丽迪亚和韦翰 </b></p>
<p>On the third morning of her visit to Lambton， Elizabeth received two letters from Jane．The first had been bad－ly addressed and sent elsewhere， then redirected．Her aunt and uncle were out walking，so she sat down to read them at once．The first had been written five days before，and started just as expected， with a description of Longbourn dinner parties and visits， but the second half of this letter was dated a day later，and was evidently written in a great hurry．This is what it said：</p>
<p>伊丽莎白在参观蓝白屯的第三天早上收到了两封简的来信。第一封因地址不清而投往别处，然后又转投过来。她舅父舅母都出去散步了，因此，她马上坐下来读信。第一封是五天前写的，不出所料，开头描述了浪搏恩的晚会和互访情况，但信的后半截所署的日期晚一天，显然是匆匆写成的，内容是：</p>
<p>Since writing the above，dear Lizzy，something most unex－pected and serious has happened But do not wish to alarm you， we are all well．It concerns poor Lydia．An express letter came at midnight last night， when we were all in bed， from Colonel Forster， to inform us that she had run away to Scot－land with one of his officers，with Wickham， in fact！There，of course， she can marry without her parents’approval．Imagine our surprise．What a foolish marriage for both of them！But at least he is not interested in her money， as he must know my father can give her almost nothing．Kitty admits that she knew about Lydia's attachment to Wickham，from Lydia's letters．Our poor mother is very upset．I must finish now，as I cannot stay away from her for long．I hope you can read this．I hardly know what I have written．</p>
<p>亲爱的丽萃，上半封信写完之后，发生了一件出人意料、极其严重的事情。但我不想吓唬你，我们身体都很好。是关于丽迪亚的。昨天晚上，我们都已睡下，半夜时分福斯特先生给我们来了封急件，通知我们，她同一个军官，实际上就是韦翰，跑往苏格兰了！当然，在那里她可以不征得父母同意就结婚。想一想我们是多么吃惊。对他们两人来说，这是多么愚蠢的结合呀！不过至少他对她的钱财不感兴趣，因为他一定知道父亲几乎不会给她任何陪嫁。吉蒂承认，从丽迪亚的信中，她知道丽迪亚爱上了韦翰。可怜的母亲十分不安。我不得不就此搁笔，因为我不能把母亲丢下太久。我希望你能读到。我简直不知道自己写了些什么。</p>
<p>Without allowing herself time to think， Elizabeth opened the second letter， dated a day later， and read impatiently：</p>
<p>伊丽莎白来不及思考，便拆开了第二封信，这是过晚一天写的。她迫不及待地读了起来：</p>
<p>My dearest sister，</p>
<p>我最亲爱的妹妹，</p>
<p>I am so confused I cannot write properly．I have bad news for you．Foolish though a marriage between Mr Wickham and our poor Lydia might be，we are now only too anxious to hear that it has taken place． There is reason to fear they have not gone to Scotland．Colonel Forster arrived here yesterday．He tells us that one of the Officers， a close friend of Wickham，believes that Wickham never intended to go to Scotland，or to marry Lydia at all．The colonel followed the couple as far as London， but they have not been seen leaving the capital．Our anxiety， my dear Lizzy，is very great．My father and mother believe the worst， and the colonel fears Wickham is not a man to be trusted，but I cannot believe him to be so wicked．And is Lydia so completely lacking in morals，that she could live with a man without being married？Impossible．Now my poor mother is really ill，my father is angry， for perhaps the first time in his life， and Kitty is being scolded for keeping the attachment a secret．While I am glad，dearest Lizzy， that you have been spared some of the confusion and worry we have been experiencing， I cannot help begging you all to come home as soon as possible．My father is going to London with the colonel to try to find Lydia．I think he is too upset to achieve results in the best and safest way，and my uncle's advice and help would be everything in the world．I rely on his goodness．</p>
<p>我心乱如麻，书不成行。又是坏消息。虽然韦翰和可怜的丽迪亚结婚可能荒唐之极，但我们现在却急于听到他们完婚的消息。有理由担心，他们并没有去苏格兰。福斯特上校昨天到这儿来了。他告诉我们说，有一位军官，是韦翰的好友，他认为韦翰从来不曾打算去苏格兰，也不曾打算和丽迪亚结婚。上校跟踪两人一直到伦敦，但还没有看到他们离开伦敦。亲爱的丽萃，我们焦虑异常。父亲和母亲尽往坏处想，而上校担心韦翰是不可信赖之人，可是我无法相信他会如此奸诈。丽迪亚会不会没有半点羞耻之心，不举行结婚仪式就和那个人住在一起？不可能。现在可怜的妈妈真地病了，爸爸很生气，这也许是他有生以来第一次生气。他们痛斥吉蒂为他们的恋情保密之举。最亲爱的丽萃，我一方面为你感到高兴，因为你幸免于我们正在经历的混乱和担忧，另一方面，我不由得要求你们都尽快回家。父亲要和上校一起去伦敦找丽迪亚。我想，他由于过分不安，可能不会用最好最安全的办法达到预期目的，因此舅舅的建议和帮助将是最重要的。我拜托他了。</p>
<p>‘Oh！Where，where is my uncle？’cried Elizabeth，running to the door．But just as she reached it， Mr Darcy came in．Her pale face and strange manner prevented him from speaking， and she， who could think of nothing except Lydia， said hurriedly，‘Excuse me，but I must leave you．I must find Mr Gardiner immediately．There is not a moment to lose．’</p>
<p>“噢！舅舅在哪儿，他在哪儿？”伊丽莎白叫道，跑到了门口。可是，她刚到门口，达西先生就进来了。她苍白的脸色和奇怪的举止让他没说出话来。她脑子中除了丽迪亚之外一片空白，她匆忙地说：“对不起，可我必须离开你。我必须马上找到嘉丁纳先生。一会儿都不能耽误。”</p>
<p>‘Good God！ What is the matter？’he cried，then added，‘Let me， or let the servant，go to find Mr and Mrs Gardiner．You are not well enough．You cannot go yourself．’</p>
<p>“天啊！怎么回事？”他叫了一声，又补充道，“让我，或者让仆人去找嘉丁纳夫妇。你不舒服，自己不能去。”</p>
<p>Elizabeth hesitated， but her legs were trembling， and she re－alized he was right． After giving the servant her message， she sat down，looking so ill that Darcy could not leave her，or stop himself saying gently，‘Let me call someone to look after you．Shall I get you a glass of wine？You are very ill．’</p>
<p>伊丽莎白迟疑了，可是她的腿在打战，她认识到他说得对。向仆人吩咐完后，她坐了下来，样子十分难看，达西先生不能离开她，也不能用柔声细语使她安静下来：“我叫人来照料你吧。来杯葡萄酒好吗？你病得很重。”</p>
<p>‘No，thank you，’she replied．‘I am quite well．I am only upset by some dreadful news I've just received form Long－bourn．’She burst into tears， and for a few minutes could not speak another word．Darcy watched her miserably， in sympa－thetic silence． At last， she spoke again．‘It cannot be hidden from anyone． My youngest sister has eloped， with——with Mr Wickham． You know him too well to doubt what will happen．She has no money， no connections， nothing that can tempt him to marry her．She is lost for ever． And I could have prevented it！ I knew how bad his character was．If only I had told my family what I knew about him！ But it is all too late now．’</p>
<p>“不，谢谢，”她回答道。“我很好。不过是刚从浪搏恩得到的可怕消息使我感到不安。”她哭了起来，好一会儿说不出话来。达西难过地望着她，满心同情地保持着沉默。最后，她又说话了。“这件事谁也瞒不了。我最小的妹妹私奔了，跟——跟韦翰先生。你对他太了解了，清楚会发生什么事。妹妹没有钱，没有社会关系，她的一切都不会吸引他与她结婚。她永远回不来了。我本来可以防止这件事发生的！我知道他的人品多么坏。我要是早点把他的底细告诉家里就好了！一切都太晚了。”</p>
<p>Darcy looked at her in astonishment．‘I am shocked，’he said，‘and sad， very sad．What has been done to find her and bring her back？’</p>
<p>达西吃惊地看着她。“我感到震惊，”他说，“而且难过，很难过。现在已经采取了什么措施去把她找回来？”</p>
<p>‘My father has gone to London， and I hope my uncle will go too．We shall leave Lambton，I hope， in half an hour．But I know very well that nothing can be done．How can such a man be persuaded？ How can we even find them？ I have not the smallest hope．It is horrible！’</p>
<p>“我父亲已去了伦敦，我希望舅舅也去。我希望半小时后离开蓝白屯。可是我非常清楚，我们什么办法也没有。怎么能说服这样一个人呢？甚至，我们怎么找到他们呢？我一点希望都不抱。太可怕了！”</p>
<p>Darcy made no answer．He was walking up and down with a serious， thoughtful expression on his face． Elizabeth soon ob-served and instantly understood it．She was losing her influence over him．This proof of moral weakness in her family was driv－ing him away from her．Never before had she so honestly be-lieved she could have loved him， as now， when mutual affection must be impossible．</p>
<p>达西没有回答。他表情严肃，若有所思地踱来踱去。伊丽莎白不久就发现并明白了这表情的意思。她对他的吸引力正在减退。这一家庭道德缺陷的有力证据正在把他从她身边推开。她从来没有像现在这样真诚地感到，她可能早已爱上了他，像现在这样，但现在，两厢情愿似乎已是不可能的了。</p>
<p>But she could not think for long of herself， when Lydia's situation was so desperate．Mr Darcy left almost immediately，politely regretting that Elizabeth and her aunt and uncle would not，in the circumstances， be able to come to dinner at Pember－ley that day， and again expressing his sympathy．When Mr and Mrs Gardiner entered the room，Elizabeth hurriedly explained everything to them， and was greatly relieved when they agreed to leave at once，to return to Longbourn．</p>
<p>但她不能总想自己的事，丽迪亚面临的形势是如此严峻。达西先生几乎马上就离开了，临走时，他很客气地说，鉴于这种情况，伊丽莎白及其舅父母将不能参加当天在彭伯里举行的晚宴了，他为此感到遗憾，并再次表示同情。嘉丁纳夫妇进屋以后，伊丽莎白急忙向他们解释了发生的一切，他们同意马上离开，一起返回浪搏恩，她这才长长舒了一口气。</p>
<p>Their packing was done at great speed，and soon they were in the carriage， driving south．</p>
<p>他们以极快的速度打点好行装，一会儿就坐上了马车，向南驱车而去。</p>
<p>‘Lizzy， ’began Mrs Gardiner， ‘I cannot believe that Wick-ham's character is so bad that he would run away with Lydia，and not marry her．Do you really think he is capable of that？’</p>
<p>“丽萃，”嘉丁纳太太开口说，“我无法相信韦翰的人品会差到这种地步，竟然把丽迪亚拐走而又不与她结婚。你真地觉得他会做出那种事吗？”</p>
<p>‘My dear aunt，Jane and I both know that he has neither honesty nor honour．He has falsely accused Mr Darcy， and has lied wickedly about the whole Darcy family．You saw what a shy，gentle girl Miss Darcy．is，but he had described her as proud，disagreeable and disdainful．’</p>
<p>“我亲爱的舅妈，我和简都知道这个人既不诚实又无信誉。他诬陷达西先生，还恶毒地编造有关达西全家的谎言。你们看到了，达西小姐多么腼腆、温柔，可他硬说人家傲慢、难以相处、目中无人。”</p>
<p>‘But does Lydia know nothing of this？’</p>
<p>“可是丽迪亚对此一无所知吗？”</p>
<p>‘Oh，no！That is the worst of all．I didn't know the truth myself until my visit to Kent， and when I returned， and told Jane， she and I decided not to make our knowledge public． Now I know that was a mistake． I never thought that Lydia could be in any danger from him．’</p>
<p>“噢，一点儿也不知道！这才是最糟糕的。我也是到肯特郡去过以后才知道事实真相的，我回来以后，和简讲了，我们俩决定不把我们了解的情况公开。现在我认识到我犯了一个错误。我从未想到过丽迪亚会受到他的威胁。”</p>
<p>When they arrived at Longbourn，Elizabeth and her aunt were able to help Jane in looking after the children．They also attempted to calm Mrs Bennet，who，however，refused to be calmed， and blamed everyone except herself for the disaster．</p>
<p>到了浪搏恩后，伊丽莎白和舅母帮着简照看孩子们。她们也努力安慰班纳特太太，而她拒绝接受安慰，把酿成灾祸的过错都推到了别人身上，觉得就她一个人没错。</p>
<p>‘If only I had been allowed to take the family to Brighton，this would not have happened．Poor dear Lydia had no one to take care of her．Why did those Forsters ever let her go out of their sight？ I am sure they neglected her．Of course， I did not want her to go to Brighton， but nobody took any notice of me，as usual．And now Mr Bennet has gone to London，and I'm sure he’ll fight Wickham，and then he’ll be killed，and then the Collinses will turn us out of the house，before he's cold in his grave！’</p>
<p>“要是允许我把孩子们都带到布赖顿就好了，也不至于会发生这种事。可怜的丽迪亚，没有一个人照顾她。那些福斯特上校们为什么不看紧她？他们肯定是没把她放在心上。当然，我不想让她去布赖顿，可是，没有人理我，就像平时那样。现在，班纳特先生也去伦敦了，他肯定会跟韦翰拼命的，然后会被人家活活打死，他尸骨未寒，柯林斯一家就会把我们赶出去！”</p>
<p>‘Do not worry，sister，’said Mr Gardiner kindly．‘I'm go- ing to London tomorrow，to help my brother-in-law．’</p>
<p>“不要担心，姐姐，”嘉丁纳先生温和地说，“我明天就去伦敦，帮我姐夫一把。”</p>
<p>‘Oh，thank you，my dear brother，’replied Mrs Bennet．‘Make sure you find Lydia and Wickham，and if they are not married yet，make them marry．And tell Lydia，they mustn’ t wait for wedding clothes，but she shall have as much money as she wants to buy them，after they are married．And keep Mr Bennet from fighting—tell him what a dreadful state I am in， so ill that I can get no rest by night or by day．And tell Lydia not to buy any clothes until she's seen me，because she doesn't know the best shops．Oh，brother，how kind you are！I hope you will manage everything．’</p>
<p>“噢，谢谢你，好兄弟，”班纳特太太回答道。“你一定要找到丽迪亚和韦翰，要是他们还没有成婚，就强迫他们成婚。告诉丽迪亚，他们不必等结婚礼服，但是，结过婚以后，再想买衣服的话，要多少钱给她多少钱。别让班纳特先生拼命——告诉他我的状况多么糟糕，我病得很重，日夜合不了眼。告诉丽迪亚不见到我不要买衣服，因为她不知道哪儿有最好的商店。噢，好兄弟，你太善良了！我希望你会把一切都处理好。”</p>
<p>The next day Mr Gardiner travelled to London，as he had promised．Now began a painful period of waiting for those left at Longbourn．They became even more anxious，as news came from Meryton of Wickham's lies，debts，and secret attach- ments to most of the servant girls in the town．Everybody de- clared that he was the wickedest young man in the world，and protested that they had always distrusted his great charm and appearance of goodness．Although Elizabeth did not believe half of these stories，she believed enough to feel sure that her sister's reputation was already lost，and even Jane almost despaired of receiving good news．</p>
<p>第二天，嘉丁纳就履行诺言，前往伦敦。现在，留在浪搏恩的人开始了痛苦难熬的等待时期。从麦里屯不断传来韦翰的消息：撒谎、欠债以及与镇上大多数年轻女仆之间的秘密恋情，这使他们更加焦虑。大家都说，他是世界上最邪恶的年轻人，并且宣称，他们一贯怀疑他的巨大魅力和堂堂仪表。虽然伊丽莎白认为这些传闻不能全信，但相信其中的一部分就足以使她认定妹妹的名声已经丧失殆尽，甚至简都不指望听到什么好消息了。</p>
<p>In a few day's time they were relieved to receive a letter from Mr Gardiner，but unfortunately it only informed them that Wickham and Lydia had not yet been found．Apparently Wickham had left gambling debts of over a thousand pounds behind him in Brighton．Mr Bennet was returning home the following day，leaving his brother-in-law in London to continue the search．When she heard this，Mrs Bennet did not show as much satisfaction as her children expected，considering the anxiety she had previously expressed for her husband's safety．</p>
<p>过了几天，他们收到嘉丁纳先生的来信，舒了口气，但不幸的是，信中只说韦翰和丽迪亚还没有找到。很显然，韦翰在布赖顿欠下了一千多英镑的赌债。班纳特先生第二天要回家，留下内弟在伦敦继续搜寻。班纳特太太听说丈夫要回来，并不像孩子们所期待的那样满意，而前几天她还在为丈夫的安全焦虑不安呢。</p>
<p>‘What，is he coming home without poor Lydia？’she cried． ‘And who will fight Wickham，and make him marry her？’</p>
<p>“什么？他没找到可怜的丽迪亚就回来了？”她嚷道。“那谁还会跟韦翰拼命，强迫他和丽迪亚成婚？”</p>
<p>Mrs Gardiner took the opportunity of Mr Bennet's return to go back to London herself，with her children．She was still longing to know how Flizabeth's relationship with Darcy had developed，but Elizabeth had not once mentioned his name，so her aunt did not dare to ask any direct questions．</p>
<p>嘉丁纳太太趁着班纳特先生回来，带着孩子们回到了伦敦。她还是希望知道伊丽莎白与达西的关系发展得怎么样了，但伊丽莎白一次都没提过他的名字，所以，舅母也不敢直接问。</p>
<p>When Mr Bennet arrived home，he appeared as calm as ever， but in a conversation with Elizabeth he admitted that he felt to blame for Lydia's elopement．</p>
<p>班纳特先生回到家以后，看样子同以前一样平静，但在与伊丽莎白的谈话中，他承认自己对丽迪亚的私奔负有责任。</p>
<p>‘I know I should have had more control over her，’he said． ‘And，Lizzy，you were right．I should never have let her go to Brighton．’</p>
<p>“我知道我应当多管管她，”他说。“丽萃，你说得对。我根本就不应该放她去布赖顿。”</p>
<p>Kitty，who was listening，said，‘Papa，if I ever went to Brighton，I'd behave much better than Lydia has done．’</p>
<p>吉蒂也在听，听罢她说：“爸爸，我要是去了布赖顿，会比丽迪亚规矩得多。”</p>
<p>‘You go to Brighton！’cried her father．‘I would not trust you within twenty kilometres of the place，for fifty pounds！ No，Kitty，I have at last learnt to be cautious，and you will feel the effects of it．No officer may ever enter the house again，or even pass through the village．And balls will be absolutely for- bidden，unless you dance only with your sisters．’</p>
<p>“你去布赖顿！”她爸爸高声叫道。“离那个地方还有20公里我都不放心，哪怕给我50英镑的押金！不，吉蒂，我终于学会了小心谨慎，你会有新体会的。任何军官以后别想再进这个家门，甚至别想从村里通过。一切舞会全部禁止，除非你与姐姐们跳舞。”</p>
<p>Kitty，taking these threats seriously，began to cry．</p>
<p>吉蒂当真了，哭了起来。</p>
<p>‘Well，well，’said he，‘don't make yourself unhappy．If you are a good girl for the next ten years，I’ll take you to the the- atre at the end of that time．’</p>
<p>“好啦，好啦，”他说，“别不高兴了。如果你未来十年规规矩矩，十年结束后我会带你去看戏的。”</p>
<p>Two days later，the news for which they had all been wait- ing so anxiously arrived．Mr Gardiner's letter informed them that Wickham and Lydia had been found，but that they were not married．However，certain financial arrangements had been made with Wickham．Mr Bennet was asked to pay Lydia one hundred pounds a year，as well as arranging for her to inherit her equal share of the five thousand pounds which the Bennet girls would inherit after their parents'death．If these reason- able conditions were agreed，Wickham had promised to marry Lydia．</p>
<p>两天以后，他们都在热切期待的消息来了。嘉丁纳先生的信告诉他们，韦翰和丽迪亚已经找到，但他们还未成婚。但是，已与韦翰达成了某种财务方面的安排。请班纳特先生每年支付丽迪亚一百英镑，并安排她在父母下世后平等地参与继承留给班纳特家女儿的五千英镑。如果答应这些合理的条件，韦翰便答应娶丽迪亚为妻。</p>
<p>At first Elizabeth and Jane were delighted that their sister's reputation would be saved through marriage，even to such a man as Wickham．But then their father explained that Wick- ham would never have agreed to marry Lydia，unless he had been paid a considerable amount of money immediately．They began to worry that it would be difficult to repay Mr Gardiner，who must have bribed Wickham in this way．Mrs Bennet，however，had no such worries．</p>
<p>开始时，伊丽莎白和简都很高兴，认为妹妹的名声可以通过婚姻得以保全，哪怕是嫁给韦翰这样一位男人。可是，接着父亲解释说，除非已经付给了韦翰一大笔钱，否则他是决不会同意娶丽迪亚的。她们开始担心，要偿还嘉丁纳先生预付的这笔钱，可能会有困难。嘉丁纳先生一定是以这种方式贿赂了韦翰。但是，班纳特太太并没有这种担忧。</p>
<p>‘He is her own uncle，after all！’she cried happily．‘Why shouldn't he pay？My dear，dear Lydia！Married at sixteen！ How I long to see her，and dear Wickham too！But the wed- ding clothes！I’ll write to my sister-in-law about them at once！I'm so happy．In a short time I’ll have a daughter mar- ried．Mrs Wickham！How well it sounds！’</p>
<p>“他是当舅舅的嘛！”她高兴地叫道。“为什么不该出点钱？我亲爱的丽迪亚！16岁就结婚！我多么盼望见到她呀！还有亲爱的韦翰！可是结婚礼服呢？我马上给她舅妈写封信！我太幸福了！这么短的时间，就嫁出一个女儿。韦翰太太！听起来多顺耳呀！”</p>
<p>Now that Lydia was going to be married，Elizabeth greatly regretted telling Darcy of her fears for her sister．But even if Lydia had been married in the most honourable way，it was ex- tremely unlikely that Mr Darcy would wish to connect himself with a family in which there was a close relationship with Wickham，the man he most justly disliked．She could not ex- pect him to go on caring for her，as she felt certain he had done when they met in Derbyshire．But now that she was sure he could not love her，she was convinced they could have been happy together．He seemed to be exactly the man who would have suited her．They could have usefully influenced each other．His mind might have been softened and his manners im- proved by her sociability，and she might have learnt from his greater judgement and knowledge of the world．But no such re- lationship could now teach an admiring world what happiness in marriage was really like．Instead，Wickham would marry Lydia，with little chance of happiness for either of them．</p>
<p>既然而迪亚要结婚了，伊丽莎白便十分后悔告诉了达西自己对妹妹的担忧。但是，即使丽迪亚以最体面的方式结婚，达西先生也极不可能愿意把自己同一个与韦翰有密切关系的家庭联系起来，因为韦翰是他最讨厌的人，当然他也理应遭到讨厌。她不能再指望他向她献殷勤，像他们在德比郡相遇时她肯定地感觉到的那样了。可是，现在既然她肯定他不可能再爱她了，她反而确信，倘若他们在一起，可能会很幸福。他配她似乎正好合适，他们可以相互积极地影响。她善于社交，可以帮助他软化思想，改善态度；他更长于判断，还有丰富的知识，可以使她从中受益。但这种关系已不复存在，他们再不能为仰慕他们的世人做出榜样，让他们看看幸福的婚姻到底是什么样子了。相反，韦翰要和丽迪亚结婚了，这给他们两人几乎都带不来一点幸福的机会。</p>
<p>Mr and Mrs Gardiner had arranged for Lydia to be married quietly in London，from their house．At first Mr Bennet had refused to allow his youngest daughter ever to enter his house again，but eventually Jane and Elizabeth persuaded him to re- ceive Lydia and her husband after the wedding．It would only be a short visit，as almost immediately she and Wickham would be moving north to Newcastle，where he had accepted a new army post．</p>
<p>嘉丁纳夫妇已安排好丽迪亚在伦敦不声张地悄悄结婚，就从他们家出嫁。开头时，班纳特先生曾拒绝让小女儿再踏进这个家门，但最后，简和伊丽莎白说服了他婚礼过后允许丽迪亚和他丈夫过来。探亲时间将会很短，因为她和韦翰几乎立刻就要到北方的纽卡斯尔去，在那里，他接受了一个新的军职。</p>
<p>When the carriage containing the young couple arrived at Longbourn House，the two elder Bennet sisters were shocked to see how unashamed Lydia was．She entered the house，laughing and joking，and asked all her sisters to congratulate her．Wick- ham was no more embarrassed than she was，and spoke to ev- eryone in his usual flattering，agreeable manner．They seemed to have no idea of the anxiety they had caused by their shame- less and wicked behaviour．</p>
<p>当载着一对新人的马车到达浪搏恩府时，班纳特姐妹中两个大的对丽迪亚的厚颜无耻感到震惊。她进了屋子，又是笑又是逗乐，还要所有的姐姐向她道喜。韦翰也比她好不到哪儿去，跟每个人说话都还是往常那种阿謏奉承、随随便便的方式。他们对于自己的无耻和行为不端所引起的焦虑似乎根本没有意识到。</p>
<p>Elizabeth was quite disgusted by their relaxed，confident ap- pearance，and determined not to show any interest when Lydia insisted on describing every detail of her wedding day．She could not help reacting with astonishment，however，when Ly- dia let slip the name of Mr Darcy．He had apparently been pre- sent at the ceremony．Why would Mr Darcy，Elizabeth won- dered，attend the wedding of two people he must hold in the greatest contempt？She could not discover the reason from Ly- dia，who suddenly remembered it was supposed to be a secret， and she could not rest without knowing the truth，so she hur- riedly sent a note to her aunt in London，asking urgently for an explanation．</p>
<p>伊丽莎白对他们那种轻松、自信的形象深恶痛绝，因此，当丽迪亚执意要描述结婚当天的每个细节时，她下决心不露出任何兴趣。但是，丽迪亚不小心说出达西先生的名字时，她禁不住作出吃惊的反应。他显然参加了婚礼。伊丽莎白感到奇怪，达西先生为什么会参加这两位他理应最为鄙夷的人的婚礼？她从丽迪亚那里发现不了原因，因为丽迪亚突然想起这事应当保密；伊丽莎白不明白真相又寝食不安，于是便匆忙给伦敦的舅妈写了封信，请求迅速作出解释。</p><a href='11.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
