<p><b>3 柯林斯先生造访浪搏恩 </b></p>
<p>‘I hope，my dear，’said Mr Bennet to his wife at break- fast the next morning，‘that you have told the cook to send up a good dinner today，as I am expecting a visitor．’</p>
<p>“亲爱的，我希望你已经通知过厨师今天送上一份像样的晚饭，我有客人来。”第二天早饭后班纳特先生对妻子说。</p>
<p>‘Who is it， my dear？ I know of nobody who is coming， un- less Charlotte Lucas happens to call in， and I hope my dinners are good enough for her．’</p>
<p>“亲爱的，是谁？除了夏洛特&middot;卢卡斯偶尔来一趟，我不知道谁还会来。要是她，家常便饭就够了。”</p>
<p>‘The person I'm talking about is a gentleman and a stranger．’</p>
<p>“我说的那个人是个有教养的男人，一个陌生人。”</p>
<p>Mrs Bennet's eyes shone with excitement．‘It's Mr Bingley，I'm sure！ Why，Jane，you never mentioned it！Well，I’ll be extremely glad to see him． Lydia， my love，ring the bell．I must speak to the cook at once．’</p>
<p>班纳特太太激动得两眼放光。“是彬格莱先生，我敢肯定！简，你怎么从来没有提过！啊，能见到他我高兴极了。丽迪亚，我的乖，快拉铃。我得马上跟厨师讲。”</p>
<p>‘It is not Mr Bingley，’said her husband．‘It's a person whom I have never seen before．’</p>
<p>“不是彬格莱先生，”她丈夫说，“这个人我以前从来没有见过。”</p>
<p>This caused general astonishment， and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters all at the same time． Having amused himself for some time with their curiosity，he finally explained．‘I have recently received a letter from my cousin，Mr Collins，who，as you know，will inherit all my property when I die， and may throw you out of this house as soon as he wants．’</p>
<p>一言既出，满座皆惊。太太和五个女儿异口同声，急切地向他发问，这使他十分得意。他先拿她们的好奇心逗了一会儿乐，最后作了解释。“最近，我收到了远房侄子柯林斯先生的一封来信。你们知道，我死后他要继承我的一切财产，到时候可能随时把你们赶出这幢房子。”</p>
<p>‘Oh， my dear！’cried his wife．‘Please don't mention that hateful man． It's the hardest thing in the world to accept the fact that your property is not left to your own children， and I'm sure， if I were you， I'd have tried to do something about it．’</p>
<p>“哦，亲爱的！”他妻子叫道。“请不要提那个可恶的家伙。自己的财产不留给自己的孩子，这恐怕是世界上最难叫人接受的事情了。我要是你的话，肯定不会就此罢休。”</p>
<p>Jane and Elizabeth tried to explain the legal situation to her again．They had often attempted to do this before．But it was a matter which Mrs Bennet refused to understand， and she con- tinued to complain bitterly about Mr Collins．</p>
<p>简和伊丽莎白又向她解释了一遍法律上的具体情况。她们以前经常向她解释，可是这种事班纳特太太拒不理解，她继续叫苦不迭地对柯林斯先生发牢骚。</p>
<p>‘It certainly is most unjust，’agreed Mr Bennet，‘and noth- ing can clear Mr Collins from the guilt of inheriting this house．But if you listen while I read his letter to you，you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself．’</p>
<p>“这件事当然很不公平，”班纳特先生表示赞同，“柯林斯先生继承这幢房子受之有愧，无论怎样他都难以免于这种愧疚。可是，如果你愿意听听他的来信，他说话的口气也许会使你的态度缓和一点。”</p>
<p>He read aloud the following letter：</p>
<p>他大声朗读了以下这封信：</p>
<p>Dear Sir，</p>
<p>亲爱的先生，</p>
<p>The disagreement between you and my late respected fa- ther always worried me， and since his death I have frequently wished to improve the relationship between our families．Af- ter a long period of study and training I have recently become a priest，and have been fortunate enough to gain the patron- age of Lady Catherine de Bourgh， widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh．This generous lady has given me the post of rector at Hunsford， which was luckily vacant．Hunsford is the village near her own large country house in Kent．Here I carry out the duties of my profession whenever necessary， and I take great care to behave at all times with grateful respect towards her ladyship．As a priest，moreover， I feel it my duty to encourage all families in my area of influence to live peacefully．Because of this，I flatter myself that I am acting correctly in offering you my friendship．I am of course concerned that when I even- tually inherit all your property， your daughters will doubtless be very poor，and I do apologize for this．I promise you I am ready to make amends in every possible way—but more about this later．If you do not object， I propose to visit you and your family on Monday November 18th，at four o’clock， and shall probably stay until the following Saturday week．This will cause me no inconvenience at all，as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence from my duties．</p>
<p>阁下与先父之不和一直令我深感不安。自从先父去世之后我一直希望重修两家之好。经过长期学习与培训，我已于最近成为牧师，并万分荣幸地获得刘易斯&middot;德&middot;包尔公爵的遗孀凯瑟琳&middot;德&middot;包尔夫人的恩宠。这位慷慨的夫人将汉斯福的教区长职位赐与了我，当时，这个职位正好空缺。汉斯福是个村庄，位于这位夫人在肯特郡巨大的乡间别墅附近。在此，一有必要，我便履行自己的职责，而且无时无刻不极力表现出对夫人的感激和尊敬。另外，作为一名牧师，我感到有责任尽我力之所及，促进本教区家家户户亲善和睦。有鉴于此，我自信向您伸出友谊之手是正确之举。我最终继承您的财产之后，诸位令媛一定会一无所有，对此我自然深感不安，并为此真切道歉。我向您保证我愿意尽一切可能给予补偿——这一点容后再叙。如果您不反对，我拟于11月18日星期一4点钟前来拜谒您和全家，并有可能在贵府打扰至星期六离开。这不会引起我什么不便，因为凯瑟琳夫人对于我偶尔离开职守绝无反对之意。</p>
<p>I remain，dear sir，with respectful good wishes to your lady and your daughters， your friend， William Collins．</p>
<p>亲爱的先生，我向尊夫人及诸位令媛致以尊敬的、良好的祝愿。您的朋友威廉&middot;柯林斯。</p>
<p>‘So we can expect this peace-making gentleman at four o’clock today，’said Mr Bennet，as he folded up the letter．‘He appears to be a most polite and serious young man．How considerate of Lady Catherine to allow him to visit us！’</p>
<p>“所以，今天下午4点这位和事佬先生就要来了，”班纳特先生说着，一面把信折叠起来。“他像是一位知书达礼、严肃认真的年轻人。凯瑟琳夫人允许他拜访我们，真是体贴入微呀！”</p>
<p>‘Well，if he is ready to make amends to the girls in some way， I shall certainly not discourage him，’said Mrs Bennet．</p>
<p>“那么，如果他愿意用某种方式给女儿们以补偿的话，我当然不会给他泼冷水，”班纳特太太说。</p>
<p>‘Although it's difficult，’said Jane，‘to guess how he in- tends to do that，it's good of him to want to help us．’</p>
<p>“虽然很难猜测，”简说，“他打算如何补偿我们，不过，他想帮助我们，倒是件好事。”</p>
<p>‘I think he's peculiar，’said Elizabeth．‘He sounds too pleased with himself，and he speaks so politely of Lady Cather- ine！And why does he apologize for inheriting Father's prop- erty in future？ We know it's not his fault．Can he be a sensible man，sir？’she added，turning to Mr Bennet．</p>
<p>“我觉得他有点儿古怪，”伊丽莎白说。“他听起来过于自鸣得意，谈起凯瑟琳夫人又过于客气！他将来继承父亲的财产为什么要道歉？我们知道那不是他的错。先生，他会是个理智的人吗？”她转向班纳特先生，补充道。</p>
<p>‘No， my dear， I think not．I have great hopes of finding him quite the opposite．There is a mixture of servility and self- importance in his letter， which promises to be entertaining．I am impatient to see him．’</p>
<p>“我想不是，亲爱的。他极有可能恰恰相反。他在信中显得既卑躬屈膝，又妄自尊大，这一定很有趣，我真想马上见到他。”</p>
<p>Mary，the middle daughter， who spent most of her time reading and who seldom joined in family conversations， now re- marked that in her opinion his letter was well expressed．But Kitty and Lydia did not show any interest in the letter or its writer．As it was highly unlikely that their cousin would arrive in a regimental uniform， they could not imagine having any pleasure in meeting him． Their mother， however， had changed her attitude towards Mr Collins after his letter， and was now preparing to meet him with such calmness that it astonished her husband and daughters．</p>
<p>年纪居中的女儿玛丽大部分时间都在读书，很少参与家人的谈话，这时她插话说，在她看来，这封信意思表达得恰如其分。可是吉蒂和丽迪亚对这封信和它的作者没表现出任何兴趣。她们想象不出来见到表兄会有什么乐趣，因为他极不可能穿着军服来。不过，她们的母亲听完信之后改变了对柯林斯先生的态度，现在准备着心平气和地迎接他，这使得丈夫和女儿们大为惊讶。</p>
<p>Mr Collins arrived punctually， and was received with great politeness by the whole family． Mr Bennet indeed said little，but the ladies were ready enough to talk， and Mr Collins did not seem in need of encouragement．He was a tall， heavy- looking young man of twenty-five．His expression was serious，and his manners very formal．Soon after his arrival， he said to Mrs Bennet，‘Madam， I must compliment you on having such a fine family of daughters． I had heard much of their beauty， but I find them even more beautiful than reports have stated．I do not doubt you will see them all well married quite soon．’</p>
<p>柯林斯先生准时到达，受到了全家极为客气的接待。班纳特先生实际上没说几句话，可是女士们总是有话可说，而柯林斯先生似乎也不需要鼓励。这个年轻人25岁，高高的个子，样子很稳重。他表情严肃，言谈拘谨。他来到不久，就对班纳特太太说：“夫人，您有这么多懂事的女儿，我必须向您表示祝贺。关于她们的美貌我耳闻很多，如今相见，才知道比传闻的漂亮百倍。我相信，您不久就会看到她们一个个喜结良缘。”</p>
<p>Mrs Bennet never quarrelled with compliments，and she answered，‘You're very kind，sir，and indeed I do hope so，be-cause otherwise they’ll have nothing at all to live on．’</p>
<p>对于别人的夸奖，班纳特太太从来不争执，于是她回答道：“谢谢你的吉言，先生，我确实希望她们找到好男人，不然的话，她们生活就无依无靠了。”</p>
<p>‘You refer perhaps to my inheriting the Bennet property？’</p>
<p>“您大概是指我要继承班纳特家的财产一事吧？”</p>
<p>‘Ah，yes，sir，I do！You must confess it is a sad business for my poor girls．’</p>
<p>“啊，是的，先生，一点儿不错！你也得承认，对我那可怜的女儿来说，这可不是什么令人高兴的事。”</p>
<p>‘I am very aware，madam，of the hardship to your lovely daughters—and could say more about this，but I am cautious of saying too much too soon．But I would like to say that I have come prepared to admire the young ladies．And perhaps when we know each other better—’</p>
<p>“夫人，我十分清楚令媛们的困难处境——关于这一点，我还有话要说，可是我十分注意讲话要宁少勿多，宁晚勿早。不过，我愿意告诉您，对于到这里后对姑娘们产生爱慕之情，我是有思想准备的。也许等我们互相熟悉之后——”</p>
<p>The bell rang for dinner，and the family moved into the dining-room with their guest．The girls smiled secretly at each other，as Mr Collins praised the hall，the dining-room and all the furniture．Mrs Bennet would normally have been delighted with such praise，but she could not help thinking that he was perhaps admiring it all as his future property．The dinner，too， he considered excellent，and he asked which of his charming cousins was responsible for it．But Mrs Bennet explained quite sharply to him that they were very well able to afford a good cook，and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen． He begged her pardon immediately for offending her，and con- tinned to apologize for about a quarter of an hour．</p>
<p>开饭的铃声响了，全家人同客人一起来到了餐厅。柯林斯先生称赞客厅、餐厅和所有的家具，姑娘们对此偷偷地相视而笑。要在往常，班纳特夫人听到这样的赞美，一定会乐滋滋的，可是这次她禁不住心里嘀咕，说不定他是在欣赏自己未来的财产呢。晚饭他也说好极了，就问是哪位迷人的表妹的手艺。可是班纳特夫人十分尖刻地向他解释说，他们完全请得起好厨师，女儿们根本不用下厨房。他于是赶紧请她原谅自己的冒失，接着又道歉了大约一刻钟。</p>
<p>Mr Bennet had hardly spoken up to now，but he thought it was time to enter the conversation．‘You seem very fortunate in your patron，Mr Collins，’he said．</p>
<p>到现在为止，班纳特先生几乎还没有说什么话，但是，他觉得现在应该介入谈话了。“柯林斯先生，你被授与圣职似乎非常幸运，”他说。</p>
<p>He could not have chosen a better opening remark．Mr Collins spoke enthusiastically for several minutes in praise of Lady Catherine．‘Never in my life have I witnessed such con- siderate behaviour in a person of high birth！Although she is such a great lady，she has never treated me with disdain．She talks to me almost as an equal，and gives me advice．For exam- ple，she has recommended me to marry as soon as possible．And do you know，she has asked me to dinner twice at her house！ Some people consider her proud，but she has only ever been kind to me．She even took the trouble to visit my small house， and was thoughtful enough to suggest one or two improve- ments—some shelves upstairs．’</p>
<p>他选的这句开场白再合适不过了。柯林斯先生兴致勃勃地讲了几分钟，称赞凯瑟琳夫人。“我一生中还从来没有见过出身如此高贵的人会这样体贴人！虽然她是一位贵妇人，可是她从来都没有看不起我。她和我谈话几乎就像和同等身份的人谈话一样，还给我提出建议。例如，她建议我尽早结婚。而且，您知道吗，她请我到她家吃过两次饭！有人认为她高傲，可是她对我从来都很和蔼。她甚至不怕麻烦到寒舍去过一次，还十分细心地让我作一两处改进——在楼上放几个架子。”</p>
<p>‘That is very correct and polite，I'm sure，’said Mrs Bennet．‘Does she live near you，sir？’</p>
<p>“我相信她做得很对、很有礼貌，”班纳特太太说，“她住得离你近吗，先生？”</p>
<p>‘Only a small country road separates my poor house from Rosings Park，her ladyship's home．’</p>
<p>“夫人的家、罗新斯庄园和寒舍仅有一条乡间小路相隔。”</p>
<p>‘I think you said she is a widow？Has she any family？’</p>
<p>“我想你刚说过她是个寡妇？有孩子吗？”</p>
<p>‘She has only one daughter，who will inherit Rosings and all Lady Catherine's property．A most charming young lady，un- fortunately in weak health．I often pay her some little compli- ment on her appearance or her accomplishments when I visit Rosings．Lady Catherine appreciates these compliments to her daughter，and I see it as my duty to please her ladyship．’</p>
<p>“她只有一个女儿，将会继承罗新斯庄园和凯瑟琳夫人所有的财产。是一位很有魅力的年轻小姐，可惜健康状况欠佳。我拜访罗新斯时经常稍稍称赞一下她的容貌和才艺。凯瑟琳夫人很喜欢对她女儿的称赞。我把取悦夫人当成了我的职责。”</p>
<p>‘I am sure you're right，’said Mr Bennet．‘No doubt you are expert at flattering with delicacy．May I ask how you think of these pleasing compliments？’</p>
<p>“我认为你做得对，”班纳特先生说。“你奉承人体贴入微，毫无疑问是个专家。请问你是怎么想起这些取悦之辞的？”</p>
<p>‘Some of them come to me at the time，but in my spare moments I do occasionally prepare a few words which may be suitable for different occasions．’</p>
<p>“有些是当下随口说的，不过，空闲时我也准备几句，也许在不同的场合可以用上。”</p>
<p>Mr Bennet listened to his cousin with the greatest emjoyment．Mr Collins was as foolish as he had hoped．But by tea-time Mr Bennet had had enough，and after tea，asked his guest to read aloud to the ladies．However，when a novel was handed to Mr Collins，he looked shocked，and protested that he never read novels．He chose a religious book instead，and start- ed reading in a slow，serious voice．Lydia could not hide her boredom for long，and after only three pages she interrupted him rudely，to ask her mother a question about one of the offi- cers in Meryton Mr Collins was offended，and refused to read any more，although Mrs Bennet and her other daughters apolo- gized for Lydia's lack of manners．</p>
<p>班纳特先生饶有兴趣地听了这位侄子的谈话。柯林斯先生正像他所预料的那样愚蠢。到喝茶时分，班纳特先生觉得已经听够了，茶点过后，他便请客人给姑娘们大声读点东西。可是，柯林斯先生一看到递给他的是小说，脸上马上露出吃惊的神色，坚持说他从来不读小说。相反，他选了一本宗教方面的书，然后用缓慢、严肃的声调读了起来。丽迪亚不会长时间地掩饰自己的厌倦情绪，他只读了三页，她便粗鲁地打断了他，问她母亲麦里屯一位军官的情况怎么样了。柯林斯先生感情受到了伤害，拒绝再往下读，尽管班纳特太太和其他几个女儿为丽迪亚的失礼道了歉。</p>
<p>Mr Collins was not a sensible man，and neither education nor society had improved him．The respect he felt for his patron， and his very good opinion of himself and his new position， made him proud and servile at the same time．Now that he had a home and a considerable income，he had decided to marry． The Bennet girls，who would lose their inheritance because of him，had a reputation for being attractive and charming，and his idea of making amends to them was to marry one of them． He considered this an excellent plan，and thought himself ex- tremely generous and unselfish in carrying it out．</p>
<p>柯林斯先生不是一位很有理智的人，教育和社会都改变不了他。对保护人的尊敬、自命不凡和新职位使得傲气和奴性在他身上并存。他现在既然有了窝，收入又相当可观，于是便决定结婚了。班纳特家的姑娘以娇媚迷人闻名遐迩，他所谓的补偿就是同其中的一位姑娘结婚，以弥补这些姑娘因为他而失去的继承权。他认为这是一个极好的计划，还觉得自己使之付诸实施，非常慷慨无私。</p>
<p>He had known he was right when he arrived at Longbourn and saw Jane Bennet's lovely face．As the eldest，she should marry first，and for the first evening she was his choice．But the next morning，after a fifteen-minute conversation with Mrs Bennet，he had to change his mind．When he explained that he was hoping to find a wife among her daughters，she replied， with a happy smile，that her eldest daughter was very likely to be engaged soon．‘But there are my other daughters，Mr Collins，’she continued，encouragingly．</p>
<p>他到达浪搏恩，见了简&middot;班纳特可爱的脸蛋后，便肯定自己的决定是正确的。简作为长女，应当首先结婚，在头天晚上，他就选中了她。但第二天早上与班纳特太太经过15分钟的交谈，他就不得不改变自己的想法了。他解释说他要在几位姑娘中找一位妻子时，班纳特太太脸上洋溢出幸福的微笑，她回答说，大女儿很可能不久就订婚。“可是我还有别的女儿呢，柯林斯先生，”她继续说，语调中带着鼓励。</p>
<p>Mr Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth，and it was soon done—done while Mrs Bennet was pouring the tea． Next to Jane in birth and beauty，Elizabeth was the obvious choice．</p>
<p>柯林斯先生不得不把简换成伊丽莎白，不一会儿就定了下来——班纳特太太沏茶时他做出了决定。伊丽莎白在年龄和姿色上都仅次于简，选她是很显然的。</p>
<p>Mr Bennet was delighted，hoping that she might soon have two daughters married．The man whom she had so disliked the day before was now a favourite with her．</p>
<p>班纳特太太乐滋滋的，满心希望不久将有两个女儿嫁出去。前一天她还感到厌恶的那个男人一下子成了她的掌上明珠。</p><a href='4.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
