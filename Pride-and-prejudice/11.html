<p><b>11 彬格莱重返尼日斐 </b></p>
<p>Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving a reply from her aunt in the shortest time possible．She sat down ea- gerly to read it．</p>
<p>伊丽莎白在最短的时间里收到了舅母的回信，十分高兴，急切地坐下来读信：</p>
<p>My dear niece，</p>
<p>亲爱的外甥女：</p>
<p>I must confess I am astonished by your request for informa- tion about Mr Darcy's share in arranging Lydia's marriage．I assumed that you would know all about it．Your uncle is as surprised as I am．But if you are really innocent and ignorant， I must tell you all the details．On the day I returned to London from Longbourn，your uncle had a most unexpected visitor．Mr Darcy came to tell us he had discovered where your sister and Wickham were staying．The reason he gave for wanting to help was his belief that he was to blame for not making Wickham's worthlessness more public，and that therefore it was his duty to assist us in every possible way．If he had an- other motive，I am sure it would be just as honourable．He knew that Wickham had a close friend in London，a woman who had once been companion to Miss Darcy，and had been dismissed for some reason．So Mr Darcy found this woman， and bribed her to give him Wickham's present address．He went to see Wickham，and insisted on seeing Lydia，hoping to persuade her to return to her family．However，Lydia told him she only cared for Wickham，and had no intention of leaving him，whether he married her or not Wickham privately told Mr Darcy that he had left the regiment because of his gam- bling debts，not because he intended to marry Lydia，and that he was still hoping to find and marry a woman of fortune in order to have a comfortable income．It was clearly necessary to persuade him to marry Lydia as soon as possible，and Mr Darcy had several meetings with Wickham to arrange finan- cisl matters with him Finally，Mr Darcy was able to visit your uncle，as I have said，to explain the whole business，and to in- sist that he alone should be responsible for paying Wickham the promised amount．Your uncle argued with him for a long time，but our visitor was so obstinate that Mr Gardiner even- tually had to agree．I think，Lizzy，that obstinacy is Mr Darcy's real fault，rather than any of the other faults of which he has been accused．He paid Wickham several thousand pounds，for past debts and future expenses，and attended the wedding to make a final payment．And in spite of Mr Darcy's declared motives，my dear Lizzy，you may be sure that your uncle would never have given in，if we had not assumed that Mr Darcy had another interest in the matter．Will you be very angry with me，my dear Lizzy，if I take this opportunity of saying how much I like him？His behaviour to us has always been as agreeable as when we were in Derbyshire．I think that if he marries the right woman，his wife may teach him to become more sociable．Please forgive me if I have assumed too much，or at least do not punish me by not inviting me to Pemberley．I shall never be happy until I have been all the way round the park．</p>
<p>你请求解释达西先生参与安排丽迪亚结婚一事，我感到十分诧异。我还以为你全都知道。你舅舅也与我一样感到奇怪。但是，如果你真地一无所知，我必须把详情告诉你。我从浪搏恩回到伦敦那天，你舅舅遇到了一位不速之客。达西先生来了，他告诉我们他发现了你妹妹和韦翰呆的地方。据他说，他之所以想帮助我们，是因为他认为没有把韦翰的道德败坏当众揭穿是他的过错，这样，他就有义务尽一切可能帮助我们。如果他是另有所图，我相信，动机也会同样可贵。他知道韦翰在伦敦有一位要好的女友，她以前做过达西小姐的女伴，后来由于某种原因被解雇了。于是，达西先生找到了这个女人，贿赂她说出了韦翰目前的住址。他找到了韦翰，并坚持要见丽迪亚，希望说服她回到家里。但是，丽迪亚告诉他她只爱韦翰，并不打算离开他，不管他娶不娶她。韦翰私下里告诉达西先生，他离开兵团是为了逃避赌债，并不是想跟丽迪亚结婚，他现在仍然希望找一位有财产的女人结婚，以便获得舒适的收入。形势很明朗，有必要说服他尽快和丽迪亚结婚，于是达西先生与韦翰数次碰面，与他安排财务问题。最后，像我刚说过的那样，达西先生才得以来访你舅舅，解释全部经过，并坚持完全由他自己负责支付许诺给韦翰的所有款项。你舅舅与他争执了半天，但是我们的客人非常固执，嘉丁纳先生最后不得不同意。丽萃，我认为固执是达西先生的真正缺点，他受到指责的其他缺点都算不上。他支付给韦翰几千英镑，用于还清旧债，应付未来开销，并参加了婚礼，最后将钱款付清。亲爱的丽萃，尽管达西先生公开说明了一些原因，但是，你可以肯定，如果我们不是觉得他别有用心，你舅舅是绝不会让步的。亲爱的丽萃，如果我借此机会说我非常喜欢他，你不会生我的气吧？他对我们一直像在德比郡那样和气。我想，如果他娶到一个合适的女人，他妻子可能会教他如何更好地交际。如果我猜测得太过分，那么请你原谅，至少不要以将来不让我去彭伯里罚我。我不把庄园逛完，是不会感到高兴的。</p>
<p>But I must go to my children now．</p>
<p>我现在必须回到孩子们身边了。</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely，M．Gardiner</p>
<p>M&middot;嘉丁纳 谨启</p>
<p>Elizabeth read this letter with a mixture of pleasure and pain． Mr Darcy had thought so little of his pride that he had spent considerable time，effort and money on two people for whom he must feel the greatest disdain．He had even had to bargain with Wickham！She could not believe he had done all this for her，a woman who had already rejected him．But the fact remained that she and her family owed him everything．How bitterly she now regretted criticizing and mocking him in the past！She was ashamed of herself，but she was proud of him，proud that in a matter of honour，he had been able to conquer his own pride．She was even rather pleased，if a little regretful，that her aunt and uncle had felt sure that there was mutual affection be- tween Mr Darcy and herself．</p>
<p>伊丽莎白读着这封信，心里既高兴又痛苦。达西先生全然不顾自尊，在两个他最为鄙视的人身上花了那么多时间、精力和金钱。他甚至还得跟韦翰讨价还价！她难以相信他这一切都是为了她，一个拒绝过他的求婚的女人。但事实仍然是，她和她的家庭应为拥有的一切感激他。她想起以前批评他、嘲笑他，后悔得痛心疾首。她为自己感到羞愧，但为他感到骄傲，骄傲的是，在荣誉上，他战胜了自己的傲慢。她甚至相当高兴（虽然带点后悔），她舅母舅父肯定地感受到了达西先生和她相爱。</p>
<p>Mrs Bennet was quite depressed when Lydia and Wickham left Longbourn to travel north to Newcastle．But soon Mrs Philips brought the happy news that Mr Bingley was expected to return to Netherfield in a day or two，and Mrs Bennet be- came very excited．She made preparations to invite him to din- ner，and counted the days that must pass before she could send the invitation．</p>
<p>丽迪亚和韦翰离开浪搏恩北上纽卡斯尔，这使班纳特太太相当丧气。但不久菲力普斯太太带来了好消息，说彬格莱先生可望于一两天内返回尼日斐，班纳特太太激动万分。她开始为邀请他吃饭作准备，并且盘算着再过几天就可以发送请帖了。</p>
<p>However，on only the third morning after his arrival，she caught sight of him from her bedroom window，riding towards Longbourn House，with another gentleman，also on horseback．</p>
<p>但是，就在彬格莱到达后的第三天上午，她就从卧室的窗户中看到了他骑着马向浪搏恩府走来，同行的还有一位先生，也骑着马。</p>
<p>‘Girls！Quickly！’she cried．‘Mr Bingley is coming！And who's that with him？It must be Mr Darcy，that tall，proud man．Well，as he is Mr Bingley's friend，we must be polite to him，but I must say，I hate the sight of him．’</p>
<p>“姑娘们！快点儿！”她喊道。“彬格莱先生来了！跟他一起来的是谁？一定是达西先生，那个高个子、傲慢的人。哎呀，他既然是彬格莱先生的朋友，我们也要客气点儿，可是，我得承认，我不喜欢见到他。”</p>
<p>Both Jane and Elizabeth felt uncomfortable，and sympathized with each other．Jane was nervous about meeting Bingley again，and determined not to show her feelings．Elizabeth was uneasy at the thought of seeing Darcy，as she was the only one who knew how much the whole family owed him，in spite of their general dislike of him．She was astonished that he had come to see her，and for a moment she allowed herself to hope that his affection and wishes might still be the same．</p>
<p>简和伊丽莎白都感到很不自在，两人同病相怜。又要见到彬格莱，简感到惴惴不安，决心不表露自己的感情。伊丽莎白一想到要见达西了，就感到很尴尬，因为就她一个人知道全家欠人家多少情，尽管大家都讨厌人家。他来看她，使她很惊奇，有那么一会儿，她大胆地希望他仍旧未改初衷。</p>
<p>She was disappointed，however，by the visit．Mr Darcy said scarcely anything to her，and appeared more thoughtful and less anxious to please than in Derbyshire．She wondered bitter- ly why he had come．In addition，she was highly embarrassed by her mother's behaviour．With flattering smiles Mrs Bennet concentrated all her conversation on Mr Bingley，while throw- ing the occasional unpleasant remark in Mr Darcy's direction． The only positive effect of the gentlemen's visit was the way in which Jane's charm and beauty appeared to excite Mr Bing- ley's admiration all over again，which Elizabeth was relieved and delighted to see．</p>
<p>但是，这次来访使她大失所望。达西失生几乎没跟她说什么，比起在德比郡来，显得更加深沉而不是急于取悦人。他为什么要来，她大惑不解。另外，她妈妈的举动使她极为难堪。班纳特太太带着奉承的微笑集中精力和彬格莱先生谈话，偶尔也冲达西先生说一句难听的话。两位先生来访的唯一积极效果是简的妩媚动人似乎重新唤起了彬格莱先生的爱慕，伊丽莎白看了深感慰藉和喜悦。</p>
<p>The Bennet family did not see the two gentlemen again until Tuesday，when they came to dinner at Longbourn．It was a great pleasure to Elizabeth to watch Bingley sitting beside Jane，and talking happily to her，but this was the only enjoy- ment she gained from the party．Mr Darcy was unfortunately sitting a long way from her，next to Mrs Bennet．Elizabeth could see how seldom they spoke to each other，and how cold and formal their behaviour to each other was．She would have given anything to be able to tell him that his kindness was ap- preciated by at least one of the family．All through the long dinner，she desperately hoped there would be an opportunity for her to have some real conversation with him later．But the evening passed without any more than a short exchange of po- liteness between them，and Elizabeth lost all hope of immediate happiness．</p>
<p>到了星期二，班纳特全家再次见到两位先生，他们是来浪搏恩赴宴的。看到彬格莱在简旁边坐下，愉快地同她交谈，伊丽莎白感受到极大的乐趣，但这也是她在晚会上得到的唯一乐趣。达西先生不巧坐得离她很远，挨着班纳特太太。伊丽莎白看得出他们彼此说话说得多么少，互相间又多么冷淡与客气。她多么希望能够告诉他，全家至少还有一个人懂得他的善意。在漫长的晚饭期间，她拼命地希望能得到一个机会与他真正谈谈。但是，整个夜晚过去了，除了简短的客套以外，他们什么也没有说，伊丽莎白断绝了一切立刻获得幸福的希望。</p>
<p>Two days after this，Mr Bingley called at Longbourn House again．This time he was alone，as Mr Darcy had gone to Lon- don．He sat with the ladies for over an hour，talking cheerfully and agreeably to them．He came the next morning，and again in the evening．Mrs Bennet took every opportunity to leave him alone with Jane，by calling her other daughters out of the room for some reason or other．She was hoping to encourage him to propose，but in spite of her efforts Bingley remained charming， and agreeable，and unattached．</p>
<p>过了两天，彬格莱又来到浪搏恩府，这次是一个人，达西先生到伦敦去了。他和小姐们坐了一个多小时，兴高采烈、十分随和地与她们聊天。他第二天上午来了，晚上又来了。班纳特太太不错过每一个机会把他和简单独留下，借故将别的女儿叫出房间。她希望鼓励他求婚，但是，尽管她作了种种努力，彬格莱还是那样爱说爱笑，招人喜欢，不偏不倚。</p>
<p>But on the third day Bingley came in the morning to go shooting with Mr Bennet．He stayed for lunch，and was still there in the evening．And when Elizabeth entered the sitting- room unexpectedly，to her surprise she saw Jane and Bingley standing close together near the fire．They turned hurriedly when they heard her，and moved awkwardly away from each other．Bingley whispered something to Jane，and ran out of the room．Jane could not keep her secret from her sister，and， kiss- ing her，cried，‘I am the happiest creature in the world！Oh， Lizzy！I do not deserve this！Why isn't everybody as happy as I am！’</p>
<p>但是，第三天彬格莱先生过来与班纳特先生一块去打猎。他留下吃了午饭，晚上还在那里。当伊丽莎白无意中来到起居室时，惊奇地发现简和彬格莱在火炉旁站着，挨得很近。他们听到她的声音，慌忙转身，尴尬地分开了。彬格莱对简小声说了句什么，便跑出了房间。简忍不住把秘密告诉了妹妹，吻了她一下，大声叫道：“我是世界上最幸福的人！噢，丽萃，我不配！大家都像我一样幸福就好了！”</p>
<p>Elizabeth congratulated her sister most warmly and sincerely．‘At last！’she thought．‘The end of all Mr Darcy's anxious advice！The end of all Caroline Bingley's lies and plans！The happiest，wisest，most reasonable end！’</p>
<p>伊丽莎白向姐姐表示最热烈、最诚挚的祝贺。“谢天谢地！”她心里想。“结束了，达西先生急切的劝告！结束了，卡罗琳&middot;彬格莱的谎言和阴谋！最幸福、最明智、最合理的结局！”</p>
<p>‘I must go and tell my mother，’continued Jane，‘as he has just gone to ask my father's permission．Oh，Lizzy！What happiness！’</p>
<p>“我得过去告诉妈妈，”简继续说，“因为他刚去请爸爸恩准。噢，丽萃！多么幸福啊！”</p>
<p>It was a joyful evening for all of them．Jane looked more beautiful than ever，and Bingley was clearly very much in love． Mrs Bennet could not say enough to describe her delight，al- though she talked of nothing else all evening，and Mr Bennet was evidently very pleased．</p>
<p>这天晚上所有的人都欢天喜地。简显得空前漂亮，彬格莱显然已坠入情网。班纳特太太的喜悦之情溢于言表，说也说不够，虽然她整个晚上别的什么也没说。班纳特先生显然也很高兴。</p>
<p>Before the two eldest sisters went to bed that night，Eliza- beth listened willingly to Jane's long description of Bingley's good qualities．At the end，Jane added，‘Oh，Lizzy！If only I could see you as happy as I am！If only there were another man like Bingley for you！’</p>
<p>那天夜里休息之前，伊丽莎白很乐意地听了简对彬格莱优良品质的长篇描述。最后，简补充说，“噢，丽萃！我要是能看到你跟我一样幸福就好了！要是再有一个像彬格莱那样的人给你就好了！”</p>
<p>‘Dear Jane，I can never be as happy as you，because I'm not as good as you．No，no，let me find my own husband．Perhaps， if I'm very lucky，I may meet another Mr Collins one day．’</p>
<p>“亲爱的简，我永远不会像你那样幸福，因为我不如你。不，不，我要找到我自己的丈夫，也许，要是我运气好，有一天也许能再碰上一个柯林斯先生。”</p>
<p>The engagement was not kept a secret for very long．Mrs Bennet whispered the news to Mrs Philips，who told all her neighbours in Meryton．Everybody soon agreed that the Ben- nets were the luckiest family in the world， although only a few weeks before，when Lydia had run away，they had been consid- ered the most unfortunate．</p>
<p>订婚一事没有保密很长时间。班纳特太太将这个消息悄悄地对菲力普斯太太说了，菲力普斯太太又透露给麦里屯的所有邻居。大家立即达成共识，说班纳特一家是世上最幸运的家庭，尽管仅仅在几个礼拜以前丽迪亚出走的时候，他们还被视为最不走运的。</p><a href='12.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
