<p><b>9 伊丽莎白在德比郡 </b></p>
<p>During the week before the regiment's departure， all the young ladies in the Meryton area became extremely de-pressed．Only the two elder Miss Bennets were still able to eat，drink， sleep and lead a normal life．They were often scolded by Kitty and Lydia， who could not understand such hard-heartedness．</p>
<p>兵团离开前一周，麦里屯地区所有的年轻小姐都变得极为沮丧。只有班纳特家两个大女儿还能吃、能喝、能睡，过着正常的生活。吉蒂和丽迪亚时常责怪她们，说不理解她们的铁石心肠。</p>
<p>‘How shall we manage without the officers！’ they cried miserably．‘How can you smile like that，Lizzy？’</p>
<p>“军官们走了我们怎么活呀！”她们悲切地嚷道。“丽萃，你怎么还笑得出来？”</p>
<p>Their affectionate mother shared all their sadness．‘I re－member when Colonel Millar's regiment went away， twenty-five years ago，’she said，‘I thought my heart was broken．’</p>
<p>她们慈爱的母亲和她们一样悲伤。“我记得25年前米勒上校的兵团离开时，我的心都碎了。”她说。</p>
<p>‘I'm sure mine will be broken，’said Lydia．</p>
<p>“我的心也快碎了，”丽迪亚说。</p>
<p>‘If we could only go to Brighton！’said Mrs Bennet．‘I'm certain a little sea－bathing would be good for me．’</p>
<p>“我们要能去布赖顿就好了！”班纳特太太说，“我肯定，洗洗海水浴对我是大有好处的。”</p>
<p>‘Oh yes！ But Papa is so disagreeable about it．’</p>
<p>“噢，是的！可是爸爸太反对了。”</p>
<p>Elizabeth tried not to listen， but could not help seeing the justice of Darcy's objections to her family．</p>
<p>伊丽莎白试图充耳不闻，但是，禁不住想到达西对她家的反对是正当的。</p>
<p>But soon Lydia's bitterness changed to absolute delight，when she received an invitation from Colonel Forster's wife， to accompany her to Brighton with the regiment． Mrs Forster was a very young woman， only recently married， and as cheerful and sociable as Lydia， witn whom she had been friendly for two months． Poor Kitty was very upset at not being included in the invitation， but Lydia cared nothing for her sister's feelings． She ran wildly through the house， calling for everyone's congratulations， and laughing and talking more loudly than ever．</p>
<p>但是，不久，丽迪亚的满脸愁苦就变成了喜笑颜开，因为她受到了福斯特上校妻子的邀请，要她同兵团一道，陪她到布赖顿去。福斯特太太十分年轻，最近刚刚结婚，和丽迪亚一样快活合群，她们的友谊已有两个月了。可怜的吉蒂因为不在受邀之列，感到坐卧不安，可是丽迪亚对姐姐的感情不管不问。她在家里东奔西跑，要大家向她道喜，谈笑声比以往任何时候都高。</p>
<p>Elizabeth could not share her sister's happiness， and felt it was her duty to advise her father secretly to refuse permission for Lydia to go．But she could not convince him that Lydia would be in any real danger， and so all the arrangements were made for her sister's departure． Elizabeth thought her father was wrong，however， and was still worried about how Lydia would behave in an atmosphere of greater freedom， and among the temptations of a fashionable seaside town like Brighton．</p>
<p>伊丽莎白不能和妹妹分享快乐，还认为她有责任偷偷建议父亲不允许丽迪亚去。但她说服不了父亲丽迪亚会有什么真正的危险，于是，丽迪亚出发的一切安排都作好了。不过，伊丽莎白认为父亲错了，一旦享有更大自由，又到了布赖顿这样追求时尚的海滨城市，丽迪亚会变成什么样呢？伊丽莎白仍然为此担忧。</p>
<p>Elizabeth had seen Mr Wickham regularly since her return from Kent， at family parties and visits． She no longer thought him so agreeable． As the rich Miss King had left Meryton to stay with her uncle， Mr Wickham appeared eager to transfer his affections back to Elizabeth． His confidence in his own charm and ability to please annoyed Elizabeth very much， so that when she met him for the last time before the regiment’ s departure， she spoke quite coldly to him． In reply to a polite question of his about her Hunsford visit， she could not stop herself mentioning her frequent meetings with Mr Darcy， and her favourable opinion of that gentleman's character． Wickham looked a little embarrassed，and made no further attempt to charm Elizabeth．They separated at last with mutual politeness， and possibly a mutual desire never to meet again．</p>
<p>自从伊丽莎白从肯特郡回来以后，她常常在家庭聚会或互访中碰到韦翰先生。她不再认为这个人很随和。因为富有的金小姐已经离开麦里屯到叔叔那儿去了，韦翰先生似乎急于将他的感情转回到伊丽莎白身上。他对自己取悦人的魅力和能力信心十足，这使伊丽莎白十分恼火，因此，在兵团离开之前他们最后见面时，她对他说话时相当冷淡。在回答他有关汉斯福之行有何感受的客套话时，她禁不住提起她经常与达西先生见面，并且说对这位先生的品行印象不错。韦翰看上去有点窘迫，也就不再试图吸引伊丽莎白了。最后，他们分手时彼此都很客气，也许彼此都不希望再次见面。</p>
<p>When Lydia left for Brighton， Elizabeth had to put up with Mrs Bennet's and Kitty's constant complaints that Longbourn had become very dull． Fortunately， she was able to look for-ward to a trip which she would soon be taking with Mr and Mrs Gardiner．They had planned to visit the Lake District，but Mrs Gardiner had recently written to say that as her husband's business made it necessary to shorten their holiday to three weeks， they would not have time to visit the whole of the Lake District comfortably．Instead，she suggested visiting Derbyshire， an area with a particularly strong attraction for her， as she had spent a large part of her early life there．Eliza-beth was disappointed， but accepted the new plan at once．Al-though it was impossible to hear of Derbyshire without think－ing of Pemberley and its owner， she felt sure she could avoid meeting Mr Darcy there．</p>
<p>丽迪亚前往布赖顿以后，伊丽莎白就不得不忍受班纳特太太和吉蒂唠唠叨叨的抱怨，说什么浪搏恩现在太死气沉沉了。幸运的是，她可以期望着不久和嘉丁纳夫妇一块去旅行。他们原计划参观大湖区，但是，嘉丁纳太太最近写信说，由于丈夫的工作需要，必须把假期缩短为三周，这样就没有时间畅游大湖区的全部风景了。因此，她提议参观德比郡，这个地方对她有特殊的吸引力，因为她早年大部分时间都在那里度过。伊丽莎白感到失望，但是马上接受了新计划。虽然一听到德比郡不可能不想起彭伯里和它的主人，但她肯定地认为她可以避免在那里与达西先生相见。</p>
<p>Four weeks later， Mr and Mrs Gardiner arrived at Long-bourn，where they had arranged to leave their children in Jane's care．The next day they set out with Elizabeth on their journey．The three of them made excellent travelling compan－ions，sharing an intelligent interest in the people and places they saw on their way， and a strong affection for each other．After visiting Oxford， Blenheim， Warwick， Kenilworth and Birmingham， they arrived in Derbyshire， and decided to stay in the small town of Lambton， where Mrs Gardiner had lived be-fore her marriage． Elizabeth discovered that Mr Darcy's house，Pemberley，was only eight kilometres away from Lambton．</p>
<p>四周以后，嘉丁纳夫妇到达了浪搏恩，他们安排好把孩子们留在那里，让简照料。第二天，他们就带上伊丽莎白踏上了旅途。他们三人是极好的旅伴，对路上的所见所闻有着共同的高雅兴趣，彼此之间又有着强大的情感联系。他们参观了牛津、布楞恩、沃里克、凯尼尔沃思和伯明翰以后，便来到了德比郡，决定呆在蓝白屯小镇，嘉丁纳太太结婚以前就住在那里。伊丽莎白发现，达西先生的住宅彭伯里离蓝白屯仅有八公里之遥。</p>
<p>‘I often used to go to Pemberley when I was younger，’said Mrs Gardiner．‘Wouldn't you like to see it，Lizzy？ We could go tomorrow．It's a beautiful place．Wickham spent his youth there， you know．’</p>
<p>“我年轻时经常到彭伯里去，”嘉丁纳太太说。“你不想看看那里吗，丽萃？我们明天就去。那地方很漂亮。韦翰年轻时就在那里度过，你也知道。”</p>
<p>‘I—I am rather tired of large country houses，aunt，’said Elizabeth，forced to pretend．How dreadful it would be to meet Mr Darcy， while viewing his house！But when she asked a servant at the hotel one or two careful questions that evening， she was told that Mr Darcy was not at home at the moment．Greatly relieved， she felt able to agree to her aunt's sugges-tion， when it was repeated the next morning， and Mr Gardiner ordered a carriage immediately．</p>
<p>“我——我有点腻味大的乡村庄园了，舅妈，”伊丽莎白说，竭力装出这个样子。看达西先生家的住宅时，再碰到达西先生，那该多糟糕呀！可是，那天晚上她详细询问了旅店仆人一两个问题后，便得知达西先生当时不在家。她大大松了一口气，第二天舅妈再问起同样的问题时，她便同意了舅妈的建议。嘉丁纳先生马上叫了一辆马车。</p>
<p>In a short time they entered the gates of Pemberley park，and drove through an extensive and beautiful wood．At the top of a hill they had their first view of Pemberley House，situated on the other side of a valley， with a line of high， wooded hills behind． The house was a large，handsome， stone building，which appeared to fit naturally into the scenery．Mr and Mrs Gardiner were warm in their admiration， and Elizabeth was de-lighted．At that moment she felt that to be mistress of Pember－ley might be worthwhile！</p>
<p>不一会儿，他们就进入了彭伯里庄园的大门，穿过一大片漂亮的林地，来到小山之巅。从这儿，他们第一次看到了彭伯里府第，它坐落于山谷另一侧，后面是一片林木覆盖的山陵。房子是巨大的、漂亮的石头建筑，与自然景观融为一体。嘉丁纳夫妇赞赏不已，伊丽莎白也感到兴奋。这时，她觉得，在彭伯里做主妇也许不错！</p>
<p>They drove up to the front door， and asked to be allowed to visit the house．The Pemberley housekeeper，a respectable，el－derly woman，showed them round．All the rooms were of a good size， and elegantly yet sensibly furnished．From every window there was an attractive view．Elizabeth began to admire the owner's taste in everything she saw．</p>
<p>他们驱车到了前门，请求参观房子内部。彭伯里的管家是一位受人尊敬的老妇人，她带领着他们参观。每个房间都很宽敞，家具陈设也风雅有致。从每扇窗户都能看到迷人的风景。从所见的一切中，伊丽莎白开始欣赏主人的志趣。</p>
<p>‘And I might have been mistress of this place！’she thought．‘Instead of viewing these rooms as a stranger， I might be welcoming my uncle and aunt as visitors．But no，’she sud－denly remembered， ‘that could never be．I wouldn't have been able to invite my uncle and aunt，or any other of my vulgar family connections．’This was a lucky thought， which saved her from something like regret．</p>
<p>“我差点儿就做了这儿的主妇呢！”她想。“我不但不必以一个陌生人的身份前来参观，而且还可以把舅父母当作贵客欢迎。可是不行。”她忽然想起来，“永远做不到。我无法邀请舅父母或者其他卑贱的亲戚。”她幸亏想到了这一点，才没有为当初的事后悔。</p>
<p>She longed to enquire of the housekeeper whether her mas-ter were really absent， but luckily her uncle asked the question instead．It was quite alarming to hear that Mr Darcy was ex－pected to arrive the next day， with a large group of friends．How glad Elizabeth was that their own journey had not been delayed a day！</p>
<p>她真想问问这位管家，主人是否真的不在家，不过，她舅舅正好替她问了这个问题。听说达西先生预计明天到家，还要带许多朋友来，她感到很吃惊。她庆幸他们自己的旅行没有向后推迟一天！</p>
<p>Mr and Mrs Gardiner were enjoying their conversation with the housekeeper， who seemed content to talk about her master．</p>
<p>嘉丁纳夫妇很乐意与管家谈话，管家似乎很高兴谈自己的主人。</p>
<p>‘Mr Darcy is a very handsome gentleman， as you will see from the painting upstairs．His sister is most attractive too，and so accomplished！She plays and sings the whole day．My master has just sent a new piano from London for her． He's such a kind brother，he’ll do anything for Miss Georgiana．’</p>
<p>“达西先生很英俊，从楼上的画像中你们可以看到。他妹妹也很有魅力，非常多才多艺！她整天弹啊唱啊的。我的主人刚让人从伦敦给她运来一架新钢琴。他这个哥哥非常善良，他为乔治安娜小姐不惜一切。”</p>
<p>‘Does Mr Darcy spend much time at Pemberley？’asked Mr Gardiner．</p>
<p>“达西先生在彭伯里呆的时间长吗？”嘉丁纳先生问。</p>
<p>‘Not as much as I'd like， sir．’</p>
<p>“我倒希望他能多呆些日子，先生。”</p>
<p>‘If your master married，he might spend more time here！’</p>
<p>“主人结婚以后，可能会在这里呆的时间长些！”</p>
<p>‘Yes，sir， but I don't know when that’ll be． I don't know who is good enough for him．’Mr and Mrs Gardiner smiled，and Elizabeth listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper continued．‘It's no more than the truth．Every-body who knows him says the same． He's never spoken a cross word to me， and I've known him since he was a baby． Some people call him proud， but I've never seen any of that． He's the best master that ever lived．’</p>
<p>“是的，先生。可是我不知道他什么时候结婚。我不知道谁能配得上他。”嘉丁纳夫妇笑了。管家继续讲；伊丽莎白越听越惊奇。“我说的全是实话。认识他的人都这么说。他从来没有对我说过一句生气的话，我是从小把他看大的。有的人说他傲慢，可是我一点也看不出来。他是世界上最好的主人。”</p>
<p>Elizabeth almost stared at her．‘Can this be Mr Darcy？’she wondered．This was the most extraordinary praise for the man she had always thought so disagreeable and proud， especially with people he considered inferior to himself．She longed to hear more， but now the housekeeper was leading them upstairs．Soon Elizabeth found herself in front of the painting of Mr Darcy．He was smiling at her， just as she remembered him smiling sometimes when he looked at her． She looked at the picture silently for several minutes before going downstairs with the others．At that moment Elizabeth certainly felt more warmly towards Mr Darcy than at any time since their first meeting．She was beginning to realize that she had underestimated his character． His housekeeper's opinion of him was totally favourable， and what praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant？ As she stood in front of his picture， she gratefully remembered the warmth of his feelings for her， and began to forget the way in which he had expressed them．</p>
<p>伊丽莎白几乎目瞪口呆。“这可能是达西先生吗？”她疑惑不解。她一贯认为这个人与别人格格不入，傲慢无比，特别是对那些他认为地位低的人，现在却听到了对他最为不平凡的赞美。她渴望多听一些，可是管家带他们上了楼。不一会儿，伊丽莎白就发现自己站到了达西先生的画像前。他正冲着她微笑，正是那种有时候他看她时所带的笑容。她默默地看了一会儿画像，便随其他人下楼去了。这时，伊丽莎白对达西先生产生了自第一次见面以来从未有过的亲切感。她开始认识到她低估了他的品格。管家对他的看法是完全肯定的，再说，有什么样的赞美比聪明的仆人的赞美更难得呢？她站在画像前那会儿，感激地回忆起他对她的温暖感情，而开始忘掉他表达感情的方式。</p>
<p>As they had now seen all the rooms which were open to the public， the housekeeper called the gardener， who was going to show them the park and gardens．They were just walking away from the house， when Elizabeth turned to have one last look，and saw the owner of Pemberley come suddenly forward from behind the house．</p>
<p>现在，他们已看完所有向公众开放的房屋，管家就把园丁叫过来，园丁要领着他们参观庄园和花园。他们正要离开房子，这时伊丽莎白又回头看了最后一眼，看到庄园的主人突然从房子后面走了过来。</p>
<p>They were within twenty metres of each other， and Eliza-beth could not avoid his seeing her．Their eyes instantly met，and they both blushed． He appeared very surprised， but， recov-ering quickly，approached and spoke to Elizabeth，if not calmly， at least with perfect politeness． Astonished and con-fused，she received his greetings with embarrassment．Soon he could find no more to say， and left her to return to the house．Mr and Mrs Gardiner， who had been watching from a distance， expressed their admiration of his appearance， but Eliz-abeth could only think of her feelings． How unfortunate that she had come！She blushed again．It might seem as if she had planned this meeting with him．And his behaviour was so different！ Never before had she heard him speak so politely and so gently．What could it mean？</p>
<p>他们相距不到二十米，伊丽莎白根本来不及躲闪。顷刻间，四目相对，两人都涨红了脸。达西显得十分惊奇，但很快恢复过来，走上前去，与伊丽莎白说话。他谈不上镇定自若，但至少可以说十分客气。伊丽莎白感到既惊讶又心慌意乱，很尴尬地接受了他的问候。一会儿，他就觉得没什么可说的了，便离开她回到了屋里。嘉丁纳夫妇一直在远处观看，他们对他的外貌大加称赞，但伊丽莎白心中只有自己的感情。她来得多不是时候！她脸又红了。好像是她特意来见他似的。而他的态度也和以前完全不同！她从来没有听到过他说话这么彬彬有礼，这么温柔。这是什么意思呢？</p>
<p>Her head full of these thoughts， she joined her uncle and aunt in their walk through the gardens．They were walking slowly beside an attractive stream， when they noticed Mr Dar-cy coming towards them． This time Elizabeth was able to con-trol herself better， and she returned his greetings politely． She hid a smile when he asked her to do him the honour of intro－ducing him to her friends， as she felt sure he was not expecting the well－mannered Gardiners to be some of her low－born rela－tions．He certainly seemed surprised when she introduced her uncle and aunt， but took care to talk for some time to Mr Gar－diner， with every appearance of interest．Elizabeth was delight－ed that these relations，at least，could not be criticized for their poor behaviour or lack of intelligence．On their way back to the house，Mr Darcy walked beside Elizabeth．There was a short si-lence before she spoke．</p>
<p>她满脑子胡思乱想，加入了舅父舅母的行列，步行穿越花园。他们正沿一条引人注目的小溪缓行，这时，他们注意到达西先生朝他们走来。这一次，伊丽莎白控制得比较好，很有礼貌地回了他的问候。达西要她赏光，并且介绍一下她的朋友，她掩住了笑容，因为她敢肯定，达西不会想到温文尔雅的嘉丁纳夫妇会是她出身低下的亲戚。她介绍完舅父舅母后，他自然感到奇怪，但竟然跟嘉丁纳先生攀谈了一会儿，似乎很感兴趣。至少这两位亲戚不会被人指责为举止欠妥或智力贫乏，伊丽莎白对此感到欣慰。在返回住宅的路上，达西先生和伊丽莎白并肩走着。稍微沉默了片刻，伊丽莎白说：</p>
<p>‘Your housekeeper informed us you would not arrive until tomorrow，so I had not expected to find you here．’</p>
<p>“你的管家告诉我们你到明天才回来，所以，我没想到会在这儿碰上你。”</p>
<p>‘It is true．I came early on business．The rest of the party will be here tomorrow．Among them are Mr Bingley and his sisters， whom you know．’He continued after a pause，‘And there is one other person who particularly wishes to meet you．Will you allow me，or do I ask too much， to introduce my sister to you？’</p>
<p>“是这样。我提前回来是有公务在身。剩下的人明天到。其中有彬格莱先生和他的姐妹，你都认识。”顿了一下，他继续说：“还有另外一个人特别希望见到你。你能否赏光，允许我向你介绍一下我的妹妹？你是否认为这样太冒昧了？”</p>
<p>Surprised but flattered by this great compliment，Elizabeth gave her permission． When they arrived at the house， Mr Darcy offered them some refreshment，but they politely refused．Mr Darcy helped the ladies into the carriage，and as it drove away from Pemberley，Elizabeth watched him walking slowly back towards the house．Mr and Mrs Gardiner were loud in their praise of him， but Elizabeth said very little．</p>
<p>伊丽莎白感到奇怪，但因为受到这种恭维而受宠若惊，便答允了他。他们到了宅第前，达西先生请他们进去吃点小点心，但他们客气地谢绝了。达西先生扶着两位女客上了马车，马车驶离彭伯里时，伊丽莎白看着他慢慢地走回了房子。嘉丁纳夫妇大声称赞他，但伊丽莎白几乎什么也没说。</p>
<p>The very next morning Mr Darcy brought his sister to visit Elizabeth and the Gardiners at the hotel in Lambton．Mr and Mrs Gardiner were astonished by the honour they were receiving， but Elizabeth's obvious embarrassment， and Darcy's haste in making the visit so immediately， soon provided them with an explanation．They observed their niece and Darcy care－fully during the visit， and could not doubt that the gentleman was in love， although they were not certain of the lady's feel－ings．</p>
<p>就在第二天上午，达西先生就带着他妹妹来到了蓝白屯的旅馆，拜访伊丽莎白和嘉丁纳夫妇。嘉丁纳夫妇对这种殊荣甚感吃惊，但伊丽莎白明显的尴尬神色加上达西匆忙地安排如此紧迫的拜访，不久就给他们俩提供了解释。在拜访中他们俩密切地观察外甥女和达西的行为，结论是，毫无疑问，这位先生已经爱上了小姐，但小姐的感情还不敢确定。</p>
<p>Elizabeth was delighted to discover that Georgiana Darcy，far from being proud，as Wickham had said，was just very shy，with quiet，gentle manners．It was clear that she greatly ad－mired her brother，and had every intention of liking Miss Ben－net，as Darcy had spoken of her so favourably．Elizabeth was al-so satisfied to see that Bingley，who was with the Darcys，did not seem particularly interested in Georgiana， in spite of Caro－line Bingley's wishes．And she had to admit that she had never seen Mr Darcy behaving so sociably and pleasantly，not only to herself， but also to the relations to whom he had referred with such disdain during that last conversation in Hunsford Rectory．Elizabeth herself was more than usually anxious to make herself agreeable to everybody， and she succeeded， be－cause Bingley was ready， Georgiana was eager， and Darcy de－termined，to be pleased．</p>
<p>伊丽莎白喜悦地发现乔治安娜&middot;达西不像韦翰所说的那样，根本谈不上高傲，只是十分羞怯，举止十分恬静、温柔。很明显，她很钦佩哥哥，并极欲同班纳特小姐结交，因为达西尽说她的好话。伊丽莎白还高兴地看到，和达西兄妹同行的彬格莱似乎对乔治安娜小姐不是特别感兴趣，这一点就由不得卡罗琳&middot;彬格莱了。她还不得不承认，她还从来没有见过达西先生的举止这样随和，这样令人高兴，不但对她如此，而且对自己的亲戚也如此。然而，最后一次在汉斯福教区长住宅谈话时，他曾如此鄙夷地说到她的亲戚。伊丽莎白本人也比往常更加急于使自己的形象在所有人面前显得和蔼可亲。她成功地做到了这一点，因为彬格莱时刻准备着接受她这种形象，乔治安娜渴望着接受她这种形象，达西下决心接受她这种形象。</p>
<p>Miss Darcy， encouraged by her brother， invited Elizabeth and the Gardiners to dinner at Pemberley in two days'time，and when this invitation had been accepted， the Darcys and Mr Bingley left， with many warm expressions of politeness on both sides．Mr and Mrs Gardiner were very curious about their niece's feelings for Mr Darcy， but were careful not to question her．</p>
<p>达西小姐在哥哥的鼓励下，邀请伊丽莎白和嘉丁纳夫妇两天后到彭伯里赴宴。他们接受了邀请之后，达西兄妹和彬格莱先生就离开了，双方都说了很多暖烘烘的客气话。嘉丁纳夫妇对于外甥女对达西先生的感情感到十分好奇，但他们很小心，没有问她。</p>
<p>That evening Elizabeth lay awake for two whole hours，try－ing to understand how she felt about him．She now thought of him with respect and a certain admiration， and was deeply grateful to him， not only for having once loved her， but for still loving her enough to forgive her bitter rejection of him， as well as all her unjust accusations． The change she had noticed， in a man who was once so proud，must be caused by his love for her．Now， since she was almost sure that if she wanted，she could encourage him to propose to her again， she only had to decide how far she wished to be involved in his future happi－ness，in which she already felt a real interest．</p>
<p>那天晚上，伊丽莎白翻来覆去整整两个小时未能入睡，她在努力弄清她对达西到底是什么感觉。她现在对他感到尊敬，和一定程度的爱慕，并且怀有深深的感激之情，不但是因为他以前爱过她，而且还因为他现在还爱她，爱得足以能够原谅她对他的断然拒绝，原谅她对他不公正的指责。在一个曾如此傲慢的人身上，她所注意到的这些变化，一定是因为他对自己的爱所致。既然她几乎可以肯定，如果她愿意的话，她可以鼓励他再次向自己求婚，那么，现在她只需决定在多大程度上她愿意涉足他未来的幸福，在这一点上，她现在已感到有了真正的兴趣。</p><a href='10.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
