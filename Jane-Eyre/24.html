<p><b>第五部 枫丹庄园的女主人 24 回到特恩费得 </b></p>
<p>In the morning I explained to Diana and Mary that I had to go on a journey， and would be away for several days． Although they did not know the reason for my journey，they were far too sensitive to my feelings to bother me with questions．</p>
<p>早晨，我跟戴安娜和玛丽解释说我必须出门，离开几天。尽管她们不知道我出门的原因，但她们都小心地顾及着我的感觉，没有多问什么。</p>
<p>And so I walked to Whitcross，the lonely crossroads on the moor，where I had arrived a year ago with no money or luggage．I took the coach， and after thirty－six hours of travelling I got down at Thornfield village， and almost ran across the fields in my hurry to see the well－known house again，and its owner．I decided to approach from the front， to get the best view of the house． From there I would be able to see my master's window．'He might even be walking in the gardens，'I thought，'and I could run to him，touch him！Surely that wouldn't hurt anybody？'</p>
<p>于是我走到威特考斯。一年前，我曾身无分文来到这块沼泽地上的十字路口。我乘上马车，经过36个小时的旅程，在特恩费得村下了车。我几乎是跑着走过田野，急切地想再次看到那熟悉的老屋和它的主人。我决定从前面过去，以便看得更清楚些。从这个角度我能见到主人房间的窗户。“他或许就在花园散步呢！”我想。“我可以向他跑过去，抚摸他！这肯定不会伤了谁吧？”</p>
<p>But when I reached the great stone columns of the main gate，I stood still in horror． There， where I had hoped to see a fine， impressive house， was nothing but a blackened heap of stones，with the silence of death about it．No wonder that letters addressed to people here had never received an answer．There must have been a great fire．How had it started？Had any lives been lost？ I ran back to the village to find answers to my questions．</p>
<p>但是，当我来到大门的巨大石柱下时，我呆站着，心中充满恐惧。我原本希望看到一座府第巍然矗立的地方，此时却只剩下几堆焦黑的石头，周围是死一般的寂静。难怪写给这里的人的信，没有一点儿回音呢。一定是发生了大火灾，怎么引起的呢？有人死去吗？我跑回村子去寻找答案。</p>
<p>'Well，ma'am，'the hotel－owner told me，'I was one of Mr Rochester's servants at the time， and I can tell you it was his mad wife who started the fire in the governess's room． The master had been wildly in love with the governess， you see，ma'am， although she was just a plain little thing， and when she disappeared， he almost went mad． His wife must have understood enough to be jealous of the girl．Anyway，in the fire the master risked his life helping all the servants out of the house， then bravely went back to save the mad woman． We saw her jump from the roof and fall to her death． But because he went back to help her，he was badly injured in the fire，losing a hand and the sight of both eyes．Very sad， ma'am．'</p>
<p>“是这样，女士。”旅馆的店主对我说。“我曾是罗切斯特先生的一个仆人，我可以告诉你，一定是他的疯老婆在家庭教师的房间里放了火。女士，你知道，尽管她只是个不起眼的小东西，可是主人却疯狂地爱上了她。她失踪后，他几乎要疯了。他的老婆一定还知道嫉妒那个姑娘。不管怎样，大火中主人冒着生命危险帮助所有的仆人们逃出了屋子，然后又勇敢地冲回去救那疯女人。我们看到她从屋顶跳下来，摔死了。可是他因为回去救她却被大火严重烧伤，失去了一只手，一双眼睛也瞎了。真让人伤心啊，女士。”</p>
<p>'Where is he now？'I asked urgently．</p>
<p>“他现在在哪儿？”我急切地问。</p>
<p>'At another house of his， Ferndean Manor， thirty miles away．</p>
<p>“在他的另一所房子枫丹庄园那儿，离这儿30英里。”</p>
<p>I hired a carriage to drive there at once．</p>
<p>我立即租了辆马车，向那里驶去。</p></body></html>
