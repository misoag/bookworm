<p><b>5 布鲁克赫斯特先生的来访及其后果 </b></p>
<p>It was difficult for me to get used to the school rules at Lowood，and to the hard physical conditions．In January，February and March there was deep snow，but we still had to spend an hour outside every day．We had no boots or gloves，and my hands and feet ached badly．We were growing children，and needed more food than was provided．Sometimes the big girls bullied us little ones and made us hand over our teatime bread or evening biscuit．</p>
<p>我很难适应洛伍德的校规和艰苦的生活条件。1月、2月和3月，雪积得很厚，但我们仍必须每天在户外活动一小时。我们没有靴子和手套，我的手脚疼得很厉害。我们正在长身体，需要比供给量更多的食品。有时大孩子欺负小孩子，逼我们把下午茶、面包或晚上的饼干交给她们。</p>
<p>One afternoon，when I had been at Lowood for three weeks，a visitor arrived．All the teachers and pupils stood respectfully as he entered the schoolroom．I looked up．There，next to Miss Temple，stood the same black column which had frowned on me in the breakfast-room at Gateshead．I had been afraid he would come．I remembered only too well Mrs Reed's description of my character，and the promise he had given her to warn teachers at Lowood about my wickedness．Now they would consider me a bad child for ever．</p>
<p>我到洛伍德三星期后的一个下午，有一个客人来了。所有的老师和学生都恭敬地站着，看他走进教室。我抬头一看，站在丹伯尔小姐身边的不就是在盖茨赫德的早餐室里对我皱眉头的大黑柱子嘛！我就怕他来。我清清楚楚地记得里德太太就我品行所说的一番话，也记得他向她保证要提醒洛伍德的老师们我是多么坏。现在她们会永远认为我是个坏孩子了。</p>
<p>At first Mr Brocklehurst spoke in a murmur to Miss Temple．I could just hear because I was in the front of the class．</p>
<p>布鲁克赫斯特先生先对丹伯尔小姐低语了几句。因为站在前排，我刚好能听到一点儿。</p>
<p>'Tell the housekeeper she must count the needles，and only give out one at a time to the girls，they lose them so easily！And Miss Temple，please make sure the girls stockings are mended more carefully．Some of them have a lot of holes．'</p>
<p>“告诉管家她必须清点针数，每次只发给学生们一根针，她们太容易弄丢了。丹伯尔小姐，姑娘们的长筒袜应该补得再仔细些，有的洞太多了。”</p>
<p>'I shall follow your instructions，sir，'said Miss Temple．</p>
<p>“先生，我会照办的。”丹伯尔小姐说。</p>
<p>'And another thing which surprises me，I find that a lunch of bread and cheese has been served to the girls recently．Why is this？There is nothing about it in the rules！Who is responsible？' 'I myself，sir，'answered Miss Temple．'The breakfast was so badly cooked that the girls couldn't possibly eat it，so they were hungry．'</p>
<p>“还有一件事让我奇怪，我发现最近孩子们吃了一顿有面包和奶酪的午饭。为什么？校规里没这规定！谁负责任？”“先生，我本人。”丹伯尔小姐答道。“早餐做得很差。孩子们无法吃下去，所以饿着肚子。”</p>
<p>'Madam，listen to me for a moment．You know that I am trying to bring up these girls to be strong，patient and unselfish．If some little luxury is not available，do not replace it with something else，but tell them to be brave and suffer，like Christ Himself．Remember what the Bible says，man shall not live by bread alone，but by the word of God！Madam，when you put bread into these children's mouths，you feed their bodies but you starve，their souls！'</p>
<p>“女士，你听我说。你知道我要把这些孩子培养得强壮、耐心和无私。如果缺了点儿奢侈品，不要用其他东西来弥补，应该告诉她们要勇敢，要像基督那样去受苦。记锥圣经》里的话，人不能仅靠面包活着，人要靠上帝的话活着。女士，当你把面包放到这些孩子的嘴里时，你填饱了她们的肚子，却给她们的心灵带来了饥馑。”</p>
<p>Miss Temple did not reply．She looked straight in front of hef，and her face was as cold and hard as marble．Mr Brocklehurst，on the other hand，now looked round at the girls，and almost jumped in surprise</p>
<p>丹伯尔小姐没有答话，她直视前面，脸孔如大理石般冰冷僵硬。而布鲁克赫斯特先生这时却扫视着孩子们，突然惊讶得几乎跳起来。</p>
<p>'Who—what is that girl with red hair，with curls，madam，with curls everywhere？'</p>
<p>“这是谁？这个红头发女孩儿是谁？鬈发，满头鬈发！”</p>
<p>'That is Julia Severn，'said Miss Temple quietly．'Her hair curls naturally，you see．'</p>
<p>“她是朱丽雅&middot;沙文。”丹伯尔小姐轻声说。“您知道，她天生鬈发。”</p>
<p>'Naturally！Yes，but it is God we obey，not nature！Miss Temple，that girl's hair must be cut off．I have said again and again that hair must be arranged modestly and plainly．I see other girls here with too much hair．Yes，I shall send someone tomorrow to cut all the girls' hair．'</p>
<p>“天生！是的，可我们遵从的是上帝，而不是天性！丹伯尔小姐，必须得把那姑娘的头发剪了。我曾反复说头发必须梳理得简单朴实，我看这儿的其他孩子头发也太多了。好吧，明天我派个人来，给所有的孩子理发。”</p>
<p>'Mr Brocklehurst…'began Miss Temple．</p>
<p>“布鲁克赫斯特先生……”丹伯尔小姐刚开口。</p>
<p>'No， Miss Temple，I insist． To please God these girls must have short， straight hair and plain， simple clothes…'</p>
<p>“不，丹伯尔小姐，我一定要这样做。为了让上帝高兴，这些孩子必须只留短短的直发，穿朴素、简单的衣服……”</p>
<p>He was interrupted by the arrival of three ladies，who had unfortunately not heard his comments on dress and hair．They all wore the most expensive clothes and had beautiful，long，curly hair．I heard Miss Temple greet them as the wife and daughters of Mr Brocklehurst．</p>
<p>他的讲话被三位女士的到来打断了，可惜她们没有听到他关于头发和衣装的高论。她们都穿着最昂贵的衣服，留着长长的美丽的鬈发。我听到丹伯尔小姐和她们打招呼，她们是布鲁克赫斯特先生的太太和女儿。</p>
<p>I had hoped to hide my face behind my slate while Mr Brocklehurst was talking，so that he would not recognize me，but suddenly the slate fell from my hand and broke in two on the hard floor．I knew only too well what would happen next．</p>
<p>他说话时，我本想把自己的脸藏到石板后，好让他认不出来，可是石板突然从我手中滑落，掉在地上碎成了两片。我完全知道下面该发生什么了。</p>
<p>'A careless girl！'said Mr Brocklehurst quietly，almost to himself'The new girl，I see． I must not forget to say something to the whole school about her．'and then to me，aloud，</p>
<p>“粗心大意的孩子！”布鲁克赫斯特先生轻声说，几乎像在自言自语。“我知道了，是新来的。我不能忘了向全校讲讲她的事。”然后他大声对我说：</p>
<p>'Come here，child．'</p>
<p>“孩子，到这儿来。”</p>
<p>I was too frightened to move，but two big girls pushed me towards him． Miss Temple whispered kindly in my ear，'Don't be afraid，Jane．I saw it was an accident．'Her kindness touched me，but I knew that soon she would hear the lies about me，and then she would hate me！</p>
<p>我害怕得动弹不得，但两个大女孩把我推了过去。丹伯尔小姐亲切地在我耳边悄悄说：“简，别害怕。我看到你不是故意的。”她的好心感动了我，可我知道她会听到关于我的谎言，然后就会讨厌我了！</p>
<p>'Put the child on that chair，said Mr Brocklehurst．Someone lifted me up on to a high chair，so that I was close to his nose．Frightened and shaking，I felt everyone's eyes on me．</p>
<p>“让她站在那把椅子上。”布鲁克赫斯特先生说。于是有人把我抱到一把高高的椅子上，我都快碰到他的鼻子了。我害怕得发抖，觉得每个人的眼睛都在盯着我。</p>
<p>'You see this girl？'began the black marble column．'She is young，she books like an ordinary child．Nothing about her tells you she is evil． But she is all wickedness！ Children， don't talk to her，stay away from her．Teachers， watch her， punish her body to save her soul—if indeed she has a soul，because this Child…I can hardly say it… this child is a liar！'</p>
<p>“你们看到这个女孩了？”黑石头柱子开始说话了。“她很小，看上去像个普通的孩子。从她身上看不出她是邪恶的，但她坏透了。孩子们，不要跟她说话，躲开她。老师们，监视她，惩罚她的身体以便拯救她的灵魂——如果她有灵魂。因为这个孩子……我真难以启齿……这孩子会撒谎！”</p>
<p>'How shocking！'said the two Brocklehurst daughters，each wiping a tear or two from their eyes．</p>
<p>“真叫人吃惊！”布鲁克赫斯特的两个女儿同声说，还用手擦着眼中的一两滴泪。</p>
<p>'I learned this fact，'continued the great man，'from Mrs Reed，the kind lady who took care of her after her parents'death and brought her up as a member of the family． In the end Mrs Reed was so afraid of this child's evil influence on her own children that she had to send her here．Teachers， watch her carefully！'</p>
<p>这个了不起的人又说：“我是从里德太太那儿得知这一切的。这位好心的女士从她父母去世后就照顾她，把她当作自家人一样抚养。最后里德太太因为非常担心这孩子会对自己的子女产生恶劣的影响，不得不把她送到这里。老师们，认真监督她！”</p>
<p>The Brocklehurst farmily stood up and moved slowly out of the schoolroom．At the door， my judge turned and said，</p>
<p>布鲁克赫斯特一家站起来，慢慢走出教室。走到门口，我的审判者转过身来说：</p>
<p>'She must stand half an hour longer on that chair， and nobody may speak to her for the rest of the day．'</p>
<p>“她还得在椅子上再站上半个小时，今天谁也不许同她讲话。”</p>
<p>So there I was， high up on the chair， publicly displayed as an ugly example of evil．Feelings of shame and anger boiled up inside me，but just as I felt I could not bear it any longer，Helen Burns walked past me and lifted her eyes to mine． Her look calmed me．What a smile she had！It was an intelligent，brave smile，lighting up her thin face and her tired grey eyes．</p>
<p>于是我就这样高高地站在椅子上，作为邪恶的丑恶典型示众。我心中充满羞愧和愤怒，我正觉得再也无法忍受时，海伦&middot;伯恩斯从我面前走过，抬起头来看着我。她的目光让我平静下来。她笑得多好！那是智慧、勇敢的微笑，映亮了她瘦削的脸颊和疲惫的灰色眼睛。</p>
<p>When all the girls left the schoolroom at five o'clock， I climbed down from the chair and sat on the floor．I no longer felt strong or calm， and I began to cry bitterly．I had wanted so much to make friends at Lowood， to be good， to deserve praise． Now nobody would believe me or perhaps even speak to me．Could I ever start a new life after this？</p>
<p>5点钟，所有女孩都离开了教室。我从椅子上爬下来，坐在了地上。我再也不觉得坚强和平静了，开始放声大哭。我曾渴望在洛伍德交朋友，做好孩子，得到表扬，现在谁也不会再相信我，可能也不会再跟我说话了。我以后还能开始新生活吗？</p>
<p>'Never！'I cried．'I wish I were dead！'Just then Helen arrived，bringing my coffee and bread．I was too upset to eat or drink，but she sat with me for some time， talking gently to me， wiping away my tears， and helping me to recover． When Miss Temple came to look for me， she found us sitting quietly together．</p>
<p>“永远不能！”我喊道。“我真希望自己死了！”正在这时海伦来了，给我拿了咖啡和面包。我难过得不想吃，也不想喝，但她陪我坐了一会儿，轻声跟我说话，给我擦眼泪，帮助我恢复常态。丹伯尔小姐来找我时，看到我们俩正静静地坐在一起。</p>
<p>'Gome up to my room，both of you，'she said．</p>
<p>“到我房间里来，俩人都来。”她说。</p>
<p>We went to her warm，comfortable room upstairs．</p>
<p>我们来到她楼上温暖、舒适的房间。</p>
<p>'Now tell me the truth， Jane，'she said．'You have been accused， and you must have the chance to defend yourself．'</p>
<p>“简，现在跟我说实话。”她说。“你受到指责，必须有机会为自己辩护。”</p>
<p>And so I told her the whole story of my lonely childhood with the Reed family，and of my terrible experience in the red room．</p>
<p>于是我向她讲述了我在里德家度过的孤独的童年，以及在红房子里的可怕经历。</p>
<p>'I know Dr Lloyd，who saw you when you were ill，'she said．'I'll write to him and see if he agrees with what you say．If he does，I shall publicly tell the school you are not a liar．I believe you now，Jane．'And she kissed me．She turned to Helen．</p>
<p>“我认识你生病时去看你的洛依德先生。”她说。“我会写信给他，看他是否同意你的说法。如果他同意，我将公开告诉全校，你没撒谎。简，现在我相信你了。”她吻了我，然后转向海伦。</p>
<p>'How are you tonight， Helen？ Have you coughed a lot today？'</p>
<p>“海伦，你今晚怎么样？今天咳得厉害吗？”</p>
<p>'Not very much，ma'am．'</p>
<p>“不厉害，太太。”</p>
<p>'And the pain in your chest？'</p>
<p>“胸口还疼吗？”</p>
<p>'It's a little better，I think．'</p>
<p>“我觉得好点儿了。”</p>
<p>Miss Temple examined Helen carefully，and sighed a little Then she gave us some tea and toast．For a while I felt I was in heaven，eating and drinking in the warm，pretty room，with kind Miss Temple and Helen．</p>
<p>丹伯尔小姐端详着海伦，叹了口气。然后她让我们喝茶，吃烤面包片。一时间我觉得自己到了天堂，在温暖、漂亮的房子里，和善良的丹伯尔小姐还有海伦一起又吃又喝。</p>
<p>But when we reached our bedroom，Miss Scatcherd was checking the drawers．</p>
<p>但是当我们到教室时，斯盖查德小姐正在检查抽屉。</p>
<p>'Burns！'she said．'Yours is far too untidy！Tomorrow，all day， you will wear a notice on your forehead saying UN－TIDY！'</p>
<p>“伯恩斯！”她说。“你的抽屉太乱了！明天一天，你必须在脑门上贴上一个字——乱！”</p>
<p>Helen said Miss Scatcherd was quite right，and wore the notice all the next day But I was furious，and at the end of the afternoon，tore it off her head and threw it in the fire．</p>
<p>海伦说斯盖查德小姐一点儿没错，第二天果然贴上了字条。但是，我气愤极了，傍晚，我把字条从她头上揪下来，扔进了火里。</p>
<p>When Miss Temple received a letter from Dr Lloyd，agreeing that what I had said was true，she told the whole school that I had been wrongly accused and was not a liar From that moment，I felt I was accepted，and set to work to learn as much as I could，and make as many friends as possible．</p>
<p>丹伯尔小姐收到了洛依德医生的回信，同意我说的是实情。于是她向全校宣布我被错怪了，我不是个撒谎的人。从那一刻起，我觉得自己被接受了，开始努力学习，广交朋友。</p><a href='6.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
