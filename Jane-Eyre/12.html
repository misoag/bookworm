<p><b>12 吉普赛女人 </b></p>
<p>No sooner had Mr Mason joined the group of guests than a servant entered to announce the arrival of an old gipsy woman，who was supposed to be a skilled fortune-teller.The ladies were very excited and decided to ask her to tell their fortunes .Miss Ingram，as usual，was first，and spent fifteen minutes alone with the old woman in the library．She came back looking cross .</p>
<p>梅森刚刚加入客人的行列，仆人就进来通报一位吉普赛老妇人来了，据说是算命高手。女士们都很激动，决定让她算算命。和往常一样，英格姆小姐捷足先登，和老妇在书房里待了一刻钟。她回来时，面带不快。</p>
<p>'It's just childish nonsense！How can you all believe in that sort of thing！'she said，picking up a book and pretending to read it．But as she frowned more and more，and did not turn a page，I assumed that the gipsy's words were more important to her than she wanted us to think．Next，three young ladies went in together，and came back full of praise for the gipsy's skill．</p>
<p>“简直是小孩子说胡话。你们怎么能相信这一套！”她说着拿起一本书，假装读着。但她的眉头越皱越紧，没有翻动一页，我猜普吉普赛人的话对她来说比她让我们想像的要重要。接着，三位年轻女士一起走了进去，回来时对吉普赛人的技巧赞不绝口。</p>
<p>'She's old，and dirty， and ugly，' they cried，shocked，'but she knows everything about us，everything！'While the gentlemen were calming them down，the servant entered the room again．</p>
<p>“她又老、又脏、又丑。”她们吃惊地叫着。“可是我们的事她什么都知道。”先生们安抚着她们，这时仆人又走了进来。</p>
<p>'Excuse me，miss，'he said to me．'The gipsy says there's another young single lady in the room．She refuses to leave the house until she has seen all the young ladies．It must be you .'</p>
<p>“对不起，小姐。”他对我说，“吉普赛人说还有一位年轻女士在屋里。不见到所有的女士，她不答应离开这里。她指的一定是你。”</p>
<p>'Oh，I'll go，'I said gladly．I was curious to see the gipsy．</p>
<p>“噢，那我去。”我高兴地答道。我很好奇，想见见那个吉普赛人。</p>
<p>She was sitting in an armchair in the library，murmuring words over a little black book.Her large black hat covered most of her face,but when she lifted her head,I saw her dark eyes.</p>
<p>她坐在书房的一把扶手椅上，对着一本小黑书念念有词。宽大的黑帽子几乎遮住了她整个的脸，但她抬起头时，我看到了一双黑眼睛。</p>
<p>'So you want me to tell your fortune?'she asked.</p>
<p>“那么你想让我算命？”她说。</p>
<p>'Well,I must warn you,I don't believe in your skill.'</p>
<p>“我得警告你，我不相信你的把戏。”</p>
<p>'I expected that.why don't you tremble?'</p>
<p>“我料到了。你怎么不发抖呢？”</p>
<p>'I'm not cold.'</p>
<p>“我不冷。”</p>
<p>'Why don't you turn pale?'</p>
<p>“为什么你脸色不变得苍白？”</p>
<p>'I'm not ill.'</p>
<p>“我没玻”</p>
<p>'Why don't you ask me to tell your fortune?'</p>
<p>“为什么你不让我算命？”</p>
<p>'I'm not a fool.'</p>
<p>“我不是傻瓜。”</p>
<p>The old woman laughed and started smoking a short black pipe.</p>
<p>老妇大笑起来，开始用一个短小的黑烟斗吸烟。</p>
<p>'I can prove that you're cold,and ill,and a fool,'she said.'Listen.You're cold,because you're alone.You're ill,because you lack love.And you're a fool,because love is near you,and you won't take one step to reach it.'</p>
<p>“我可以证明你冷，还有病，还是个傻瓜。”她说，“听着，你冷，因为你孤单；你有病，因为你缺少爱；你是个傻瓜，因为爱就近在咫尺，你却不能迈出一步够到它。”</p>
<p>'That's true of many people,'I said, interested.</p>
<p>“很多人都这样。”我感兴趣地说。</p>
<p>'Yes,but especially true of you.I can see that happiness is waiting for you, if you really want it．Tell me,in that room of fine people,isn't there one face you look at ,one person you're interested in ?'</p>
<p>“是的，但你更是这样。我可以看出，如果你真想得到幸福，幸福正等待着你。告诉我，在那一屋子的优雅的人当中，不是有一张脸你在看，有一个人你感兴趣吗？”</p>
<p>' I hardly know the ladies and gentlemen here,' I answered.</p>
<p>“我几乎不认识这些女士和先生。”我答道。</p>
<p>'Well,you serely know the master of the house?What do you think of his relationship with his guests, and with one particular guest?' asked the gipsy, smiling wickedly.</p>
<p>“那么，你当然认得这家的主人了？你觉得他和客人，和其中一位客人，关系如何？”吉普赛人带着狡黠的微笑问道。</p>
<p>'They're all very friendly with each other，'I replied cautiously．The gipsy seemed to know a lot about Thornfield．</p>
<p>“他们彼此非常友好。”我小心地回答。吉普赛人似乎很了解特恩费得。</p>
<p>'Friendly！I'd say more than that，in fact I'd go so far as to mention the name of Blanche Ingram and the word，marriage．They will obviously be an extremely happy couple，although I told Miss Ingram something about the Rochester property which made her look quite depressed．If a wealthier gentleman comes along，Mr Rchester might lose his beautiful bride…'</p>
<p>“友好！我说不止于此。实际上我还要说出布朗蒂&middot;英格姆的名字和结婚这个词。他们显然会是无比幸福的一对儿，虽然我刚才对英格姆小姐讲了罗切斯特家产的事，让她很不高兴。如果有一位更富有的绅士随行，那么罗切斯特先生可能会失去漂亮的新娘…”</p>
<p>But I came to hear about my future，not Mr Rochester's！</p>
<p>“可我是来为自己算命的，不是为罗切斯特先生！”</p>
<p>'It depends on whether you're going to stretch out your hand for happiness．Let me look at your face．Your eyes and your mouth show me that feelings are important to you，but your forehead shows me that common sense is your main guide in life．You will never do anything wrong or shameful．Well，I respect that．I don't want sacrifice or sorrow in my life．I want-but that will do．I'd like to stay here looking at you for ever，but I must stop acting now．'</p>
<p>“这取决于你是否伸出手去争取幸福。让我看看你的脸，你的眼睛和嘴巴告诉我情感对你来说是重要的，但你的额头告诉我理智才是你生活的主要指南。你永远不会做出错事或丑事，我尊重这点。我不希望自己的生活中有牺牲或痛苦，我希望——但这样就行。我希望永远待在这里看着你，不过我现在得停止演戏了。”</p>
<p>Was I dreaming？What was happening？The old woman's voice had changed and become as familiar to me as my own．</p>
<p>我在做梦吗？出什么事了？老妇的声音变了，变成了与我自己的一样熟悉的声音。</p>
<p>'Well，Jane，do you know me？'asked the familiar voice．And，struggling with the old clothes，Mr Rochester stepped out of his disguise．</p>
<p>“好了，简，你认识我吗？”熟悉的声音问。挣脱着破衣服，罗切斯特先生不再伪装了。</p>
<p>Sir，you've been talking nonsense to make me talk nonsense．It's hardly fair．'</p>
<p>“先生，你在胡说，也害得我胡说。这不公平。”</p>
<p>'De you forgive me，Jane？'</p>
<p>“你原谅我吗，简？”</p>
<p>'I shall try to，sir．But you shouldn't have done it．</p>
<p>“先生，我会努力，可你不该这么做。”</p>
<p>'What are my guests doing，Jane？'</p>
<p>“简，我的客人在做什么？”</p>
<p>'Discussing the gipsy，I imagine．Oh，and did you know that a stranger has arrived to see you？'</p>
<p>“我想在议论吉普赛人吧。噢，你知道有一个陌生人来看你吗？”</p>
<p>'A stranger！I wasn't expecting anyone．Who can it be？'</p>
<p>“陌生人！我没等谁来埃是谁呢？”</p>
<p>'His name's Mason，sir，and he comes from the West Indies．</p>
<p>“先生，他叫梅森，从西印度群岛来。”</p>
<p>The smile froze on Mr Rochester's lips，and his face went White．</p>
<p>微笑在他的嘴上凝住了，他的脸变得苍白。</p>
<p>'Mason！The west Indies！'he repeated three times．</p>
<p>“梅森！西印度群岛！”他重复了三遍。</p>
<p>'Do you feel ill，sir？'I asked，worried．</p>
<p>“先生，你不舒服吗？”我担心地问。</p>
<p>'Jane，help me，'he murmured，almost falling．I helped him to sit down，and sat with him．He took my hand and rubbed it gently．</p>
<p>“简，帮帮我。”他嘟囔着，几乎摔倒。我扶他坐下，然后坐到他身边。他握着我的手，轻轻抚摸着。</p>
<p>'I wish I were on an island with you and nobody else，with no trouble or danger or terrible memories to make me suffer．</p>
<p>“我希望我和你待在一个小岛上，没有别人、没有麻烦、没有危险、没有痛苦的记忆折磨我。”</p>
<p>'How can I help you，sir？I'd give my life to help you．'</p>
<p>“先生，我怎样才能帮你呢？我可以豁出命来帮助你。”</p>
<p>'Jane，if I need help，I'll ask you，I promise．Get me a glass of wine now．'I fetched one from the dining-room，and gave it to him．He looked less pale，but very stern．</p>
<p>“简，如果我需要帮助，我会叫你，我保证。现在给我拿杯酒来。”我从餐厅拿来一杯酒递给他。他看上去没有那么苍白了，但很严肃。</p>
<p>'Jane，if all those fine guests of mine came and spat at me，what would you do？'he asked．</p>
<p>“简，如果我的那些优雅的朋友走过来对我吐唾沫，你会怎么做？”他问。</p>
<p>'Turn them out of the house，sir，if I could．'</p>
<p>“先生，如果办得到，我就把他们轰出去。”</p>
<p>'But if they only looked at me coldly，and whispered behind their hands about me，and then left me one by one？</p>
<p>“但如果他们只是冷眼看着我，掩口议论我，然后一个个离开我呢？”</p>
<p>'I'd stay with you，sir，to comfort you．'</p>
<p>“我会留下陪你，安慰你，先生。”</p>
<p>'And if the whole world disapproved of me，would you still stay with me？'</p>
<p>“如果全世界都反对我，你还会留下来陪我吗？”</p>
<p>'If you deserved my friendship，as I'm sure you do，I wouldn't care about other people's disapproval．</p>
<p>“如果你配得上我的友情，我也确信是这样，那么我不会理会其他人的反对。”</p>
<p>'Thank you，Jane．Now go and ask Mr Mason to come and see me．'So I did，and，leaving the two men in the library，went to bed．</p>
<p>“简，谢谢。现在叫梅森来见我。”我照办了，我让他们单独在书房待着。自己去睡了。</p>
<p>Much later I heard him showing Mr Mason to his bedroom，and was glad that Mr Rochester sounded so cheerful．</p>
<p>很久以后，我听到他带梅森进了他的卧室；听到他的声音如此愉快，我感到很高兴。</p><a href='13.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
