<p><b>4 交朋友 </b></p>
<p>The next morning we got up in the dark as before，but the water was frozen，so we could not wash．It was freezing cold in all the rooms．This time the porridge was not burnt，but I still felt hungry，as the quantity was so small．</p>
<p>第二天早晨，我们和以往一样天黑就起床了，可是水都冻了冰，不能洗漱了。所有的屋里都冰冷冰冷的。这次粥没有烧糊，但我还是饿，因为量太少了。</p>
<p>I stayed in the bottom class，but noticed the girl that I had been talking to was in another class．Her surname seemed to be Burns．Teachers called girls by their surnames in this school．Her class were studying history，and her teacher，Miss Scatcherd，appeared constantly annoyed by her．</p>
<p>我仍在最低班，却注意到曾和我讲话的女孩在另一个班，她好像姓伯恩斯。在这所学校，老师们总是用姓叫学生。她们班在学历史，她的老师斯盖查德小姐似乎总是被她惹恼。</p>
<p>'Burns，hold your head up，can't you！'</p>
<p>“伯恩斯，抬起头来，难道做不到吗？”</p>
<p>'Burns，don't stand like that！'</p>
<p>“伯恩斯，别那么站着！”</p>
<p>The history questions asked by Miss Scatcherd sounded very difficult，but Burns knew all the answers．I kept expecting the teacher to praise her，but instead she suddenly cried out，</p>
<p>斯盖查德小姐提出的历史问题听起来非常艰深，但伯恩斯知道所有的答案。我总是期待着老师表扬她，但却听到老师突然吼道：</p>
<p>'You dirty girl！You haven't washed your hands this morning！'</p>
<p>“你这个脏丫头。早晨你没有洗手！”</p>
<p>I was surprised that Burns did not explain that none of us could wash our faces or hands because the water had been frozen．Miss Scatcherd gave an order．Burns left the room and returned，carrying a stick．The teacher took it and hit Burns several times with it．The girl did not cry or change her expression．</p>
<p>我感到惊讶的是，伯恩斯并没有解释，我们谁也没洗脸、洗手，因为水冻冰了。斯盖查德小姐下了一个命令。伯恩斯出去了，回来时拿了一根棍子。老师接过棍子，在伯恩斯身上打了好几下。她既没有哭，也没有表情上的变化。</p>
<p>'Wicked girl！'said Miss Scatcherd．'Nothing will change your dirty habits！'</p>
<p>“坏丫头！”斯盖查德小姐说。“什么也改变不了你脏的习惯！”</p>
<p>Later that day，during the play-hour，I found Burns alone by the fireside，reading the same book as before，and I started talking to her．</p>
<p>后来在游戏的时侯，我找到了独自坐在火边的伯恩斯，她还在读那本书。我开始和她说话。</p>
<p>'What is the rest of your name？'I asked．</p>
<p>“你叫什么名字？”我问。</p>
<p>'Helen，'she replied．</p>
<p>“海伦。”她答道。</p>
<p>'Do you want to leave Lowood？'</p>
<p>“你想离开洛伍德吗？”</p>
<p>'No，why should I？I was sent to school here，so I must learn as much as I can．'</p>
<p>“不，为什么要离开呢？我被送到这里上学，所以必须尽量多学些东西。”</p>
<p>'But Miss Scatcherd is so cruel to you！'I burst out．</p>
<p>“但斯盖查德小姐待你太狠了！”我生气地说。</p>
<p>'Cruel？Not at all．She is strict and she sees my faults．'</p>
<p>“狠吗？没什么。她很严格，能看到我的毛玻”</p>
<p>'If I were you，I'd hate her，'I cried．'If she hit me with a stick，I'd seize it and break it under her nose．'</p>
<p>“如果我是你，我会恨她的。”我大声说。“如果她用棍子打我，我会把它夺过来，在她眼皮底下把它折断。”</p>
<p>'I don't think you would，'answered Helen quietly．'And if you did，Mr Brocklehurst would send you away from school，and your relations would be upset．Anyway，the Bible tells us to do good，even if other people hurt us．Sometimes you have to put up with some hard things in life．'</p>
<p>“我觉得你不会那样做。”海伦平静地说。“如果你做了，布鲁克赫斯特先生会把你赶出学校，你的亲戚会不高兴的。不管怎样，《圣经》教导我们要做好事，即使别人伤害我们也一样。有时候你必须忍受生活中的艰难。”</p>
<p>I could not understand her ideas but I had a feeling she might be right．I looked at her in wonder．</p>
<p>我不能理解她的想法，但觉得她也许是对的。我疑惑地看着她。</p>
<p>'You say you have faults，Helen．What are they？To me you seem very good．'</p>
<p>“海伦，你说你有错，错在哪儿？我觉得你很好。”</p>
<p>'You are wrong，'she answered．'I'm untidy and careless and I forget the rules．I read when I should be doing my homework．You see，Miss Scatcherd is right to scold me．'</p>
<p>“你错了。”她答道。“我不整洁，粗心大意，还常忘了规定，该做作业的时候我却读书。你瞧，斯盖查德小姐批评我是对的。”</p>
<p>'Is Miss Temple as strict as that？'I asked．</p>
<p>“丹伯尔小姐也这么严厉吗？”我问。</p>
<p>A soft smile passed over Helen's normally serious face．</p>
<p>海伦一贯严肃的脸上掠过淡淡的微笑。</p>
<p>'Miss Temple is full of goodness．She gently tells me of my mistakes，and praises me if I do well．But even with her help I don't concentrate properly in class，I just dream away the time，and then I can't answer the teacher's questions．'</p>
<p>“丹伯尔小姐好极了。她和蔼地告诉我哪里不对；我做得好，她会表扬我。但即便有她的帮助，我在课上还是不能集中精神。我总是在做梦，于是就回答不了老师的问题。”</p>
<p>'But today in history you knew all the answers！'I said．</p>
<p>“但今天历史课上你知道所有的答案啊！”我说。</p>
<p>'I just happened to be interested，that's all，'she replied．</p>
<p>“我只不过感兴趣罢了，仅此而已。”她答道。</p>
<p>'I expect you are always interested in Miss Temple's lessons，because you like her and she is good to you．I'm like that．I love those who love me，and I hate those who punish me unfairly．'</p>
<p>“我觉得你总是对丹伯尔小姐的课感兴趣，因为你喜欢她，她也待你好。我就是这样，别人爱我，我也会爱她。谁不公平地惩罚我，我就恨谁。”</p>
<p>'You should read the Bible and do what Christ says—people who believe in God should love their enemies，'said Helen．</p>
<p>“你应该读读《圣经》，按基督的话去做——信仰上帝的人应该爱他的敌人。”海伦说。</p>
<p>'Then I should love Mrs Reed and her son John，which is impossible，'I cried．</p>
<p>“那我应该爱里德太太和她儿子约翰了？不可能！”我叫着。</p>
<p>Helen asked me to explain what I meant，and listened carefully to the long story of what I had suffered at Gateshead．</p>
<p>海伦让我解释一下这是什么意思，并仔细地听了我在盖茨赫德漫长的痛苦经历。</p>
<p>'Well，'I asked impatiently at the end，'isn't Mrs Reed a bad woman？Don't you agree with me？'</p>
<p>最后我不耐烦地问：“怎么样，里德太太难道不是坏女人？你不赞成我吗？”</p>
<p>'It's true she has been unkind to you，because she dislikes your faults，as Miss Scatcherd dislikes mine．But look how bitterly you remember every angry word！Wouldn't you be happier if you tried to forget her scolding？Life is too short to continue hating anyone for a long time．We all have faults，but the time will come soon when we die，when our wickedness will pass away with our bodies，leaving only the pure flame of the spirit．That's why I never think of revenge，I never consider life unfair．I live in calm，looking forward to the end．'</p>
<p>“她的确对你不好，因为她不喜欢你的缺点，就像斯盖查德小姐不喜欢我的一样。如果你努力忘了她的训斥，不是会开心点儿吗？生命太短暂了，没时间恨一个人那么久。我们都有错误，但我们不久就会死去，我们的邪恶会随我们的躯体一起消失，只留下精神之火。这就是为什么我从来不想报复，我从不认为生活不公平。我平静地生活，期待着终结。”</p>
<p>For a moment we both stayed silent．Then one of the big girls came up，calling，'Helen Burns！Go and put away your work and tidy your drawer immediately，or I'll tell Miss scatcherd！'</p>
<p>我们都沉默了一会儿。这时一个大孩子跑过来叫着：“海伦&middot;伯恩斯，赶快去收拾你的课本，整理你的抽屉，否则我就去报告斯盖查德小姐！”</p>
<p>Helen sighed，and，getting up，silently obeyed．</p>
<p>海伦叹了口气，站起身，默默地服从了。</p><a href='5.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
