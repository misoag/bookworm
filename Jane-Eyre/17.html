<p><b>17 婚礼 </b></p>
<p>We had no friends or family to accompany us to the church．I had not told my Reed cousins about our wedding，but I had written to my uncle，John Eyre，in Madeira．Mr Rochester was in such a hurry that he only allowed me a short time to put on my wedding dress and veil．</p>
<p>我们没有朋友或家人陪伴去教堂。我没有把婚礼的事告诉里德家的表姊妹，但给马迪拉的约翰&middot;爱舅舅写了信。罗切斯特先生那么心急，只给了我很短的时间让我穿上结婚礼服、戴好面纱。</p>
<p>'Jane，you look lovely，'he said．'But you can only have ten minutes for breakfast！'We almost ran up the road to the church，his strong hand holding mine．His dark face looked stern，and he did not speak．I did not notice the weather or my surroundings at all，I only wanted to know why he looked so fierce．Suddenly he noticed how pale I was，and stopped for a moment to let me get my breath back ．Then we walked more slowly into the church．</p>
<p>“简，你可爱极了。”他说，“不过你只有十分钟吃早饭！”我们几乎是跑着来到教堂，他有力的臂膀搂着我，深色的脸膛表情严肃，一语不发。我根本没有注意到天气和周围的环境，只是纳闷他为什么看上去这么严厉。突然他注意到我脸色发白，赶紧停了一下让我喘口气。然后，我们放慢脚步，走进教堂。</p>
<p>The priest and the clerk were waiting for us．There was nobody else except two strangers who were standing at the back of the church．The ceremony began，and soon I heard the priest come to the point in the wedding where he had to ask，'Is there any reason why these two people should not be married？'</p>
<p>牧师和执事正等着我们。除了教堂后面站着的两个陌生人，再无他人。仪式开始了，很快牧师就进行到了婚礼中他必须问的一句：“有没有理由说明这俩人不应结婚？”</p>
<p>The priest paused for a second，as was the custom，but before he could continue，a voice from the back of the church said clearly，</p>
<p>牧师照例停顿了一会儿，然而在他继续之前，教堂后面传来一个清晰的声音：</p>
<p>'There is a reason．'</p>
<p>“是有一个理由。”</p>
<p>The priest looked up from his book， and stood silent． Mr Rochester said in his deep voice，without turning his head，'Continue with the ceremony．'</p>
<p>牧师从书本中抬起头来，静静地站着。罗切斯特先生没有回头，用他深沉的声音说：“仪式继续进行。”</p>
<p>Silence fell again．Then the priest shook his head．'I must investigate this first，'he said．One of the strangers from the back of the church came forward and said，calmly and quietly，</p>
<p>又是一阵沉默。然后，牧师摇着头说：“我必须先调查一下。”其中一个陌生人从教堂后面走上前来，镇静地轻声说：</p>
<p>'This wedding cannot continue，because Mr Rochester is already married．'</p>
<p>“婚礼不能继续，因为罗切斯特先生已经结婚了。”</p>
<p>I felt as if I had been hit．Mr Rochester's whole face was like colourless marble．Without speaking or smiling，he was holding me tightly round the waist，as if he wodld never let go．</p>
<p>我觉得自己像被猛击了一下。罗切斯特先生的脸整个变成了无色的大理石。他既没说话也没有笑，只是紧紧搂着我的腰，好像永远不想放手似的。</p>
<p>'Who are you？'he growled at the stranger．'And tell me what you know of this supposed wife of mine．'</p>
<p>“你是谁？”他冲陌生人吼道。“告诉我，关于我所谓的妻子你知道些什么！”</p>
<p>'I'm a lawyer，sir．I have a certificate here proving that you married Bertha Mason in the West Indies fifteen years ago．'</p>
<p>“先生，我是律师。我有文件在此证明十五年前你在西印度群岛和伯莎，梅森结了婚。”</p>
<p>'That may prove I've been married，but it doesn't prove that she's still alive．'</p>
<p>“这可能证明我结过婚，但不证明她还活着。”</p>
<p>'I can produce a witness，'said the lawyer，'who has seen her alive recently．'</p>
<p>“我有证人。”律师说，“他最近看到她还活着。”</p>
<p>'Produce him—or go to hell！'said Mr Rochester．</p>
<p>“让他出来，不然就下地狱去！”罗切斯特说。</p>
<p>'Here he is．Mr Mason！'called the lawyer．And the second stranger slowly spproached from the shadows，his pale face looking frightened．Mr Rochester，staring furiously at him，raised his strong right arm to knock him down．</p>
<p>“他在这儿。梅森先生！”律师叫道。另一个陌生人从暗处走近，他的脸吓得发白。罗切斯特先生愤怒地瞪着他，举起强壮的右臂，要把他打翻在地。</p>
<p>'No！'cried Mason，trembling．Mr Rochester dropped his arm，and turned away in disgust．</p>
<p>“不！”梅森发抖地叫着。罗切斯特放下手，厌恶地扭过头去。</p>
<p>'Sir，'said the priest，frowning，'don't forget we are in the house of God．Mr Mason，please tell us if this gentleman's wife is still alive．'</p>
<p>牧师皱着眉头说：“先生，不要忘记我们是在上帝的圣殿里。梅森先生，请告诉我们这位先生的妻子是不是还活着。”</p>
<p>'She's at Thornfield Hall，'replied Mason in a weak voice．'I'm her brother and I've seen her there．'</p>
<p>“她就在特恩费得。”梅森用虚弱的声音说。“我是她哥哥，曾在那儿见过她。”</p>
<p>'Thornfield Hall！'crled the priest．'I've lived here for years，and I've never heard of a Mrs Rochester！'</p>
<p>“特恩费得！”牧师大声说，“我在这里住了这么多年，从来没听说过什么罗切斯特太太！”</p>
<p>'I was careful to keep her a secret，'murmured Mr Rochester，frowning After a few minutes'thought，he announced，'I must reveal the truth，I suppose．There will be no wedding today．No doubt God will punish me for this．What this lawyer says is true．I've been married，and my wife still lives！I was tricked into marrying her when I was young，in the West Indies Madness runs in her family，but they didn't tell me that．Now she's more of an anlmal than a woman．I keep her locked away，guarded by my old servant Grace Poole．I invite you all to come to my house to see her，and to judge whether I had the right to ask this innocent young girl to marry me．Follow me！'</p>
<p>“我小心翼翼地保守着这个秘密。”罗切斯特先生紧皱眉头嘟哝着。他沉思了几分钟，宣布说：“我想我必须以实相告了。今天没有婚礼了，无疑上帝会因此而惩罚我。律师说的是对的，我曾结过婚，我的妻子还活着。我年轻时在西印度群岛，被骗娶了她。她家族有癫狂病，但他们并没告诉我。现在她更像野兽，而不是女人。我把她锁起来了，让我的老仆格丽丝&middot;普尔看守着。我请你们各位都到我家去看看她，去判断一下我是否有资格要求这个无辜的女孩嫁给我。跟我来！”</p>
<p>Still holding me firmly，he left the church，followed by the others．At the door of Thornfield Hall，Mrs Faurfax，Adele and the servants rushed forward，smiling，to congratulate us．</p>
<p>他仍然紧紧搂着我，离开了教堂，其他人跟在后面。到了特恩费得门口，费尔法斯太太、阿黛拉和仆人们都跑过来，笑着向我们道喜。</p>
<p>'Too late！'cried the master，waving them away．'Your congratulations are fifteen years too late！'We all went up to the top floor，and entered the room where Mason had been attacked．Mr Rochester lifted the curtain，opened the secret door and showed us the little room．Grace Poole was making soup over a fire，and behind her a shape crawled on the floor．It was hard to say whether it was animal or human．It growled like a wild animal，but it wore clothes，and had long，thick，dark hair．</p>
<p>“太晚了！”主人喊道，挥手让他们走开。“你们的祝贺迟到了十五年！”我们都走上顶层，来到梅森受袭击的那间屋子。罗切斯特先生掀起布帘，打开暗门，让我们看到了小房间。格丽丝&middot;普尔正在炉子上烧汤，身后一个东西伏在地上，很难看出那究竟是人还是动物，像野生动物一样咆哮着，但穿着衣服，黑发又多又长。</p>
<p>'How are you，Mrs Poole？'asked the master．'And how is your patient today？'</p>
<p>“普尔太太，你好吗？”主人问。“今天你的病人怎么样？”</p>
<p>'Not bad，sir，'answered Grace，'but be careful．She'll try and bite you if she sees you，sir．'Just then the shape turned and with a fierce cry attacked Mr Rochester violently．I recognized her dark，ugly face．They struggled for a moment，and then he held her down and，with Mrs Poole's help，tied her to a chair．He turned to the others with a bitter smile．</p>
<p>“还不错，先生。”格丽丝说。“不过，要小心。她如果看到你会咬你的，先生。”正在这时那东西转过身来，尖叫着向罗切斯特先生扑来。我认出了她那张丑恶的黑脸。他们挣扎了一会儿，他在普尔太太的帮助下，把她按倒在椅子上，绑了起来。他苦笑着转向其余的人。</p>
<p>'You see，gentlemen，this is my wife．This is the partner I have to live with for ever．And instead I wished to have this'（laying his hand on my shoulder）'…this young girl．Can you honestly blame me？Compare the two，and then judge me！'</p>
<p>“先生们，你们看，这就是我妻子。这就是我不得不永远与之为伴的人。相反，我想要得到这位”（他把手放到我肩上）“……这位姑娘。你们能真心责怪我吗？比较一下，然后再对我裁决！”</p>
<p>We all left the room silently．As we went downstairs the lawyer said to me，'I know you weren't aware of this，Miss Eyre．Nobody will blame you，and Mr Mason will tell your uncle so，when he goes back to Madeira．'</p>
<p>我们都沉默着离开了小屋。下楼时律师对我说：“爱小姐，我知道你不了解这一切。谁也不会怪你，梅森先生回到马迪拉时也会这么对你舅舅说。”</p>
<p>'My uncle！Do you know him？'I asked，surprised．</p>
<p>“我舅舅！你认识他？”我惊奇地问。</p>
<p>'I'm his lawyer．Mr Mason and he have often done business together．On his way back to the West Indies，Mr Mason stopped in Madeira and stayed with Mr Eyre，who mentioned that his niece was going to marry a Mr Rochester．'</p>
<p>“我是他的律师。梅森先生和他常在一起做生意。在回西印度群岛的路上，梅森在马迪拉停留，住在爱先生那儿，并听他说他的外甥女要和一位罗切斯特先生结婚。”</p>
<p>'Yes，I wrote to tell him I was getting married，'I said．</p>
<p>“是的，我曾写信告诉他我要结婚了。”我说。</p>
<p>'Well，when Mr Mason explained that Mr Rochester was already married，your uncle sent him straight back to England to prevent you from marrying and making a terrible mistake． I'm afraid your uncle is very ill and will probably die soon，so I think you had better stay in England， until you receive further news of him．'</p>
<p>“那么，梅森先生向他解释说罗切斯特先生已经结婚了，你舅舅让他立刻回英格兰，阻止你结婚，以免铸成大错。我担心你舅舅病得很重，可能不久就会死去，所以我觉得你该留在英格兰，等待他的进一步消息。”</p>
<p>After the gentlemen had left，I entered my room and locked the door．Slowly I took off my wedding dress and veil．I was weak and exhausted，and only just beginning to realize what had happened．Could I ever again trust the being I had turned into a sort of god？I would not think of him as evil，but he could not have felt real love for me．How foolish I had been to believe him，and love him so much！My hopes were all dead，and my future was empty．I lay on my bed，faint and wishing for death．while darkness swam around me．</p>
<p>先生们走后，我回到自己的房间，锁上了门。我慢慢脱掉礼服，摘下面纱。我虚弱而疲劳，才刚刚开始意识到已经发生的一切。我还能再相信几乎被我当成了上帝的那个人吗？我不会认为他是邪恶的，但他不可能真正地爱过我。我相信他，那么爱他，是多么愚蠢啊！我的一切希望都破灭了，我的未来成了泡影。我躺在床上，昏沉沉的，只想死去。黑暗慢慢将我笼罩了起来。</p><a href='18.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
