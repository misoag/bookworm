<p><b>13 陌生人遭袭击 </b></p>
<p>I was woken by the full moon shining in on me，as I had forgotten to draw my curtains．Suddenly，a wild，terrible cry broke the silence，echoing throughout the house．My heart missed a beat．What could it mean？It came from the top floor．Then I heard the sounds of a desperate struggle，just above my room．</p>
<p>由于我忘记拉好窗帘，一轮满月照在我身上，我被弄醒了。突然，一声可怕的狂叫打破了寂静，在整幢房子里回荡。我的心跳都停了。这是怎么回事？声音从顶层传来，接着我听到就在我楼上有死命挣扎的声音。</p>
<p>'Help！Help！ Help！wofl＼aflyofl6 hdp ffi6？ROCh幻ef！Rochested ForC心d's sake， comJ shouted a voice from SPSt81fS&middot; Bedroom缸rs were opened as the guests woke up．What's happening？''Fetch a candlJ'Is It a fire？''Are there burjars？''Where's Rochester？ He isn't In hs room！' 'Herel am二' called the master of the house， descending with a candle from the top floor．'It's all right．仇n't be afrai人 ladles． Aservant's had a bad dream， that's all， and started screaming． Nothing to worry abut． Please go back to your rooms． You'11 catch cold otherwise．' And so he calmed his guests and persuaded them to return to their rooms．</p>
<p>“救命！救命！救命！来人啊！救救我！罗切斯特！罗切斯特！看在上帝的份上，快来啊！”楼上有人喊着。许多卧室的门打开了，客人们都被吵醒了。“出什么事了？”“拿蜡烛来！”“着火了吗？”“有强盗？”“罗切斯特呢？他不在自己屋里！”“我在这儿！”房子的主人喊道，他拿着蜡烛从顶楼走了下来。“没事儿。女士们，别怕。一个仆人做了噩梦，然后开始喊叫，就这样。没什么好担心的。请回屋吧，不然会着凉的。”他安慰着客人们，把他们劝回屋里。</p>
<p>Butl knewthat the soundsl had heard could have nothing to do with a servant's dream．h Idressed and walted In my roonyln easel was needed． After about an hour， when ThOTllfi6ldHall WSS COthpl6t6ly SllCllt sgslll， th6f6 WSS 8cautious knock on my door．</p>
<p>但是我知道我听到的声音跟什么仆人的噩梦毫无关系。于是我穿好衣服，等在屋里，以防要我帮忙。大约一小时后，特恩费得已恢复了平静，有人小心地敲我的门。</p>
<p>'Are you awake，Jane？'asked the voice I had been expecting.</p>
<p>“简，你醒着吗？”我期待的声音问道。</p>
<p>'Yes，sir，and dressed．'</p>
<p>“先生，醒了，还穿好了衣服。”</p>
<p>'Good，I need you．Come and help me．Bring a clean cloth with you．'We went quietly up to the top floor，where he unlocked one of the small black doors．</p>
<p>“好，我需要你，来帮帮忙，带上一块干净的布。”我们悄悄走上顶层，他打开了其中的一扇小黑门。</p>
<p>'Do you feel faint at the sight of blood？'he asked．</p>
<p>“你见到血晕不晕？”他问。</p>
<p>'I don't think so，'I replied．We entered a room with curtains hung on the walls．One of the curtains was tied back to reveal a secret door into another small room．From there came an angry growling sound，almost like a dog．</p>
<p>“我想不会。”我答道。我们走进屋里，只见帘子挂在墙上，其中一个已卷好，露出一个暗门，通向另一间小屋子。从那儿传出了愤怒的嚎叫声，几乎像一只狗似的。</p>
<p>'Wait here，'said Mr Rochester，and Went into the secret room where a shout of laughter greeted him．Ah，so Grace Poole was there！He came out quickly and closed the secret door．Then he showed me why he needed me．In an armchair lay Mr Mason，his clothes and his arm covered in blood。As we bent over him，he opened his eyes and groaned．</p>
<p>“等在这儿。”罗切斯特说完走进密室，一阵狂笑迎接了他。啊，格丽丝&middot;普尔在里面！他很快退身出来，关上了暗门。然后他指给我为什么他需要我。扶手椅上躺着梅森先生，他的衣服上和手臂上都有血。当我们俯身看他时，他睁开眼睛呻吟着。</p>
<p>'Am I going to die？'he murmured weakly．</p>
<p>“我会死吗？”他虚弱地轻声说。</p>
<p>'No，man，don't be foolish．It's just a scratch，'answered Mr Rochester．'Now jane，'he said，turming to me，have to leave you in this room with Mason while I fetch the doctor．You must wipe away the blood with the damp cloth，like this，and help him to drink a little water．But on no account must you speak to him．Is that understood？'I nodded，and nervously watched him leave the room．I could hear him turning the key in the lock．</p>
<p>“不会的，别傻了，不过划伤了一点儿。”罗切斯特说。他转过身来对我交待着：“简，我要你留在屋里陪梅森先生，我去请医生。你必须用湿布擦净血迹，像这样，然后给他喝点儿水。但切莫对他说话，明白吗？”我点点头，害怕地看着他离开了房间，听到他把门锁上了。</p>
<p>So here I was，in the middle of the night，locked in with a bleeding，dying man，and a wild，murdering woman only on the other side of a door！It seemed a long night，interrupted only by Mason's groans，and by occasional animal-like noises from the secret room．I had plenty of time to wonder why these violent attacks happened，first the fire in Mr Rochester's room，and now a physical attack on a stranger．And how was Mr Mason involved？Why was he here on the top floor？I had heard his host showing him to a bedroom near mine，on the second floor．And why was Mr Rochester so frightened when Mr Mason came to Thornfield？</p>
<p>于是我就这么半夜被锁起来陪伴一个流血不止、就要死去的人，而杀人的疯女人就在门那边！夜显得那么漫长，只有梅森的呻吟和不时从密室里传出的野兽般的声音不时打破长夜。我有许多时间猜测为什么会发生这些暴力事件，先是罗切斯特先生房间着火，现在又是陌生人遭到袭击。梅森先生是怎么卷进来的？他为什么会在顶层呢？我听到主人把他领进二楼我隔壁的卧室的。梅森先生来到特恩费得，为什么罗切斯特先生那么害怕？</p>
<p>At last Mr Rochester arrived with the doctor，who cleaned and bandaged Mason's wounds．</p>
<p>终于，罗切斯特先生带着医生来了，那医生为梅森清洗、包扎了伤口。</p>
<p>'Strange！'remarked the doctor，'The skin on the shoulder has been torn by teeth，as well as a knife！'</p>
<p>“真奇怪！”医生说，“肩上的伤既有牙咬的，也有刀扎的！”</p>
<p>'She bit me，murmured Mason，when Rochester managed to get the knife from her．'</p>
<p>梅森低声说；“罗切斯特夺她手里的刀时，她咬了我。”</p>
<p>'Well，I warned you not to see her alone，'said Rochester．'You should have waited till the morning，then we could have seen her together．Den't worry，man，when you get back to the West Indies，you can forget her．Think of her as dead and buried．Now，doctor，is Mason ready to be moved？I have a carriage waiting outside You'll take him home with you to avoid gossip，and then in a few days he'll be fit enough to leave the country．</p>
<p>罗切斯特说：“我警告过你不要单独见她。你应该等到早晨，然后我们一起去看她。别担心，伙计，你回到西印度群岛，就可以把她忘掉，就当她死了．被埋掉了。医生，梅森先生能动了吗？我有马车等在外面。你把他带去你家，免生议论，几天后他就可以休养得离开这个国家了。”</p>
<p>Although it was now early morning，the house was still in total silence，and so there were no witnesses to see Mason being helped downstalrs and put in the carriage．</p>
<p>尽管已是清晨，整幢房子仍是寂静一片，因此没人看到梅森被扶到楼下，坐进了马车。</p>
<p>'Look after him，doctor．'said Rochester．'Goodbye，Dick．'</p>
<p>“医生，好好照顾他。”罗切斯特说，“迪克，再见！”</p>
<p>'Edward，make sure she's taken care of，make sure she's treated well… Mason could not continue，but burst into tears．</p>
<p>“爱德华，保证照顾好她，保证好好待她……”梅森说不下去了，哭了起来。</p>
<p>'I'll do my best，Dick，as I always have done，'replied Rochester，shutting the door of the carriage，which rolled away．'But I wish there was an end to it！'he murmured to himself．</p>
<p>“狄克，我会像以前一样尽最大努力的。”罗切斯特回答说。他关上车门，车走了。“可我希望有结束的一天。”他自语道。</p>
<p>As we were walking back through the garden to the house，he said to me，'Jane，you've had a strange night．You look pale．Were you afraid when I left you alone with Mason？'</p>
<p>我们穿过花园回到屋里时，他对我说：“简，你过了奇怪的一夜。你看上去脸色苍白。我留下你陪梅森时你害怕吗？”</p>
<p>'Not of Mason，sir，but of Grace Poole in the secret room．'</p>
<p>“不是怕梅森，是怕暗室里的格丽丝&middot;普尔。”</p>
<p>'But I'd locked her door．I would never leave you in danger．'</p>
<p>“可我已经锁了门，我不会让你处在危险中的。”</p>
<p>'Will she go on living here，sir？'I asked．</p>
<p>“她还会在这儿住下去吗？”我问。</p>
<p>'Oh yes．Don't think about her．'</p>
<p>“噢，是的。别想她了。”</p>
<p>'But I'm sure your life is in danger while she's here．'</p>
<p>“可我肯定她住在这儿你就会有生命危险。”</p>
<p>'Den't worry，I can take care of myself．I'm in more danger while Mason's in England．I live in constant fear of a disaster.'</p>
<p>“别担心，我会照顾好自己。梅森不离开英格兰，我会更有危险。我总是担心灾难会降临。”</p>
<p>'But Mr Mason's weak！You have great influence with him！'</p>
<p>“但是梅森先生很脆弱！你对他影响力很大！”</p>
<p>'Yes．He wouldn't knowingly hurt me，but by one careless word he could destroy，if not my life，at least my chance of happiness.Sit down with me on this bench，Jane．I want to ask you something．</p>
<p>“是的，他不会故意伤害我，但不小心说错一个字，他如果不是毁掉我的生活，也会夺走我寻求幸福的机会。简，和我一起坐在凳子上。我想问你点儿事。”</p>
<p>The early sun warmed the bench and the birds were singing．Now，Jane，suppose a boy in a foreign country makes a mistake，not a crime， mind you．The results of this mistake have a terrible effect on his whole life．He comes home aftef years of suffering，and meets someone，who is fresh and good and pure.Now，can he ignore society，can he forget the past,and live the rest of his life with her in peace？'</p>
<p>晨曦照暖了长凳，小鸟在唱歌。“简，如果一个男孩在国外犯了错误，我提醒你不是犯罪，错误的结果严重影响了他的整个生活。经过多年的痛苦之后，他重返故里，遇到一个人，清新、善良、纯洁。那么，他能否不顾社会，忘记过去，和她一起平静地度过余生？”</p>
<p>It was a difficult question to answer．In the end I said，</p>
<p>这个问题很难回答。最后我说：</p>
<p>'You can't rely on a human being to cure you of evil and give you peace．You must ask for God's help．'</p>
<p>“你不能依靠人来医治你的邪恶，给你安宁，你必须请求上帝的帮助。”</p>
<p>'But I think I've found the cure！It's… He paused．I held my breath．I almost thought the birds would stop singing to hear the name he was going to say．</p>
<p>“但是我觉得我已找到了出路，是……”他停住了。我屏住呼吸，我觉得连小鸟都会停止歌唱，听听他要讲出的名字。</p>
<p>'Yes，'he said in quite a different，hard voice，you've noticed my love for Miss Ingram，haven't you？Don't you think she'll cure me of my wickedness，Jane？Oh，I can hear some of the guests in the garden．Go into the house by the back door．'As I went one way，and he another，I heard him say cheerfully to the gentlemen，'Mason's already left．I got up early to say goodbye to him．'</p>
<p>“是的。”他换了完全不同的生硬语调，“你已经注意到我对英格姆小姐的爱慕，是不是？简，你不觉得她可以医治我的恶习吗？噢，我听到有客人来花园了。从后门进屋去。”我们分头走开时，我听到他高兴地对先生们说：“梅森已经走了，我一早起来和他道别。”</p><a href='14.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
