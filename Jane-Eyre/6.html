<p><b>6 开始喜欢学校 </b></p>
<p>Life at Lowood no longer seemed so hard，as spring approached．We enjoyed walking and playing in the surrounding countryside．But，with fog lying constantly in the valley，it was not a healthy place for a school，and by May more than half the girls were seriously ill with typhus fever．As a result of poor food and bad living conditions，many girls died．</p>
<p>春天来临，洛伍德的生活似乎不再那么艰难了。我们喜欢到周围的乡村散步、游戏。但是山谷中常常迷雾不散，对学校来说不是个好地方。到了5月，有一半以上的女孩子得了猩红热。由于伙食差，生活条件恶劣，许多孩子都死了。</p>
<p>While there was fear and death inside the school， the sun shone on the flowers outside，and on the flowing streams in the valleys．So I and the few who had escaped illness enjoyed the beautiful summer weather，with no lessons or discipline at all．</p>
<p>学校里充满了恐怖和死亡，而外面却是阳光照耀着的花朵和山谷间流淌的小溪。因此我和另外几个逃过病魔的孩子尽情享受着美丽的夏日，不用上课，也没有纪律。</p>
<p>Helen Burns could not come walking with me，because she was ill，not with typhus but with tuberculosis．At first I had thought she would recover，but when I learned her illness was serious，I decided to visit her at night，for what might be the last time．I found her lying in bed，looking pale and weak．</p>
<p>海伦&middot;伯恩斯不能和我一起散步，因为她病了，得的不是猩红热，而是肺结核。我原以为她会康复，但后来听说她病得很重时，便决定晚上去看她，这很可能是见她最后一面了。我发现她躺在床上，苍白而虚弱。</p>
<p>'You've come to say goodbye，'she whispered，coughing．</p>
<p>“你来告别了。”她悄声说，并不停地咳嗽。</p>
<p>'You are just in time．I'm going soon．'</p>
<p>“你来得正是时候，我很快就要走了。”</p>
<p>'Where，Helen？Are you going home？'I asked．</p>
<p>“去哪儿，海伦？你回家吗？”我问。</p>
<p>'Yes，to my long home—my last home．'</p>
<p>“是的，回我遥远的家，永远的家。”</p>
<p>'No，no，Helen！'I was crying at the thought of losing her．</p>
<p>“不，不，海伦！”想到要失去她，我哭了起来。</p>
<p>'Jane，your feet are cold．Lie down with me and cover them with my blanket．'I did so．</p>
<p>“简，你的脚是冷的。和我一起躺下，用毯子盖上。”我照办了。</p>
<p>'I am happy，Jane，'she continued．'You mustn't cry．By dying young，I'll avoid suffering．I am going to heaven．'</p>
<p>“简，我很快乐。”她接着说。“你不要哭。早点死，我可以免受痛苦，我要去天堂了。”</p>
<p>'Does heaven really exist？'I asked．</p>
<p>“真的有天堂吗？”我问。</p>
<p>'Yes，I'm sure of it．I'm sure our souls go there when we die，'she answered firmly．'</p>
<p>“是的，我敢肯定，我相信我们死时我们的灵魂能上天堂。”她坚定地回答。</p>
<p>'Will I see you again，Helen，when I die？'</p>
<p>“海伦，我死的时候会再见到你吗？”</p>
<p>'Yes，you will go to heaven too，Jane．'</p>
<p>“会的，简，你也会进天堂。”</p>
<p>I could not quite believe that heaven existed，and I held tightly to Helen．I did not want to let her go．We kissed goodnight and fell asleep．In the morning Miss Temple found me asleep with Helen Burns dead in my arms． She was buried in the local churchyard．</p>
<p>我不能完全相信有天堂存在。我紧紧抱着海伦，不想让她走。我们互相亲吻，道晚安，然后就睡着了。早晨，丹伯尔小姐发现我睡着，海伦已死在我怀里。她被埋在当地的教堂院子里。</p>
<p>Gradually the typhus fever left Lowood，but the number of deaths made the public aware of the poor conditions in which the pupils lived．Money was raised to build a new school in a better position， many improvements were made，and Mr Brocklehurst lost his position as manager．So it became a really useful place of education．I stayed for eight years，for the last two as a teacher．I was busy and happy all that time，relying greatly on the help and encouragement of my dear friend Miss Temple．</p>
<p>猩红热渐渐离开了洛伍德，但死亡的人数使公众意识到了学生们恶劣的生活条件。人们筹资在较好的位置盖了一所新学校，并做了许多改进。布鲁克赫斯特先生去掉了经理的职位，于是洛伍德变成了名副其实的教育场所。我待了八年，最后两年是做老师。无论何时我都忙忙碌碌、高高兴兴的，在很大程度上，我都依赖我亲爱的朋友丹伯尔小姐的帮助和鼓励。</p>
<p>But when she married and movd to a distant part of the country，I decided it was the moment for me to change my life too．I realized I had never known any other world apart from Lowood or Gateshead．Suddenly I wanted freedom…or at least a new master to serve．So I advertised in a newspaper for a job as a governess．When I received an answer from a Mrs Fairfax，who wanted a governess for a girl under ten years old，I accepted，with the permission of the new headmistress of Lowood．</p>
<p>但是，她结婚了，嫁到了一个偏远的地方。我觉得我也该改变自己的生活了。我意识到除洛伍德和盖茨赫德外，我对其他地方一无所知。突然，我想得到自由……或至少去为一个新主人服务。于是我在报上登了做家庭教师的广告。我从费尔法斯太太那儿得到回信，说她要为一个不到10岁的女孩找位家庭教师。经洛伍德新的女学监同意，我答应了下来。</p><a href='7.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
