<p><b>20 一个新家 </b></p>
<p>I spent a month at Moor House，in an atmosphere of warm friendship．I learned to love what Diana and Mary loved the little old grey house，the wild open moors around it，and the lonely hills and valleys where we walked for hours．I read the books they read，and we discussed them eagerly Diana started teaching me German，and I helped Mary to improve her drawing．We three shared the same interests and opinions，and spent the days and evenings very happily together．</p>
<p>在摩尔屋，我在温暖的友情中度过了一个月。我开始喜欢戴安娜以及玛丽所喜欢的——这个小小的灰色老屋，周围的开阔草地，孤零零的山丘和河谷，我们常去那里散步，一去便是几个钟头。我读她们读的书，然后大家一起热烈地讨论。戴安娜开始教我德文，我则帮助玛丽提高她的素描。我们三人有共同的兴趣和一致的想法，白天晚上都高高兴兴地待在一起。</p>
<p>However，St John hardly ever joined in our activities．He was often away from home，visiting the poor and the sick in Morton．His strong sense of duty made him insist on going，even if the weather was very bad．But despite his hard work I thought he lacked true happiness and peace of mind．He often stopped reading or writing to stare into the distance，dreaming perhaps of some ambitious plan．Once I heard him speak at a church service in Morton，and although he was an excellent speaker，there was a certain bitterness and disappointment in his words．He was clearly not satisfied with his present life．</p>
<p>但是，圣约翰却很少参加我们的活动。他常常出门，去看望莫顿的穷人和病人。他强烈的责任心使他即使在天气恶劣的时候也一定要去。然而尽管他工作很努力，我仍觉得他缺少真正的幸福和安宁的心绪。他常常停止读书或写作，呆呆地盯着远处，可能梦想着什么宏伟的计划。一次我听到他在莫顿的教堂里布道，尽管他很有口才，我却听出他话语中的某种痛苦和失望。他显然不满足于现在的生活。</p>
<p>The holiday was coming to an end．Soon Diana and Mary would leave Moor House to return to the wealthy families in the south，where they were both governesses，and St John would go back to the vicar's house in Morton，with Hannah，his housekeeper．Although，his cold manner made it difficult for me to talk to him，I had to ask him whether he had found any employment for me．</p>
<p>假期要结束了。不久戴安娜和玛丽都要离开摩尔屋，回到南方的富人家，继续做家庭教师。圣约翰要带着管家汉娜回到以莫顿的牧师的身份住的屋里去。尽管他举止冷漠，让我很难与他搭话，我还是得问他是否为我找到了工作。</p>
<p>'I have，'he answered slowly，'but remember I am only a poor country vicar，and can't offer you a job with a high salary，so you may not wish to accept it．There's already a school for boys in Morton，and now I want to open one for girls，so I've rented a building for it it，with a small small cottage for the schoolteacher．Miss Oliver，who lives in the area and is the only daughter of a rich factory-owner，has kindly paid for the furniture．Will you be the schoolteacher？You would live in the cottage rent-free，and receive thirty pounds a year，no more．</p>
<p>“找到了。”他慢慢地说。“但不要忘了我只是个乡下的穷牧师，不可能给你一份薪水高的工作，所以你可能不愿接受。在莫顿已有一所男孩子上的学校，现在我想为女孩子办所学校。因此我已租好了校舍，其中有教师住的小房于。奥利弗小姐住在这一带，是一个富裕的工厂主的女儿，她好心买来了家具。你能做教师吗？你可以免费住在小房子里，每年可得30镑，不会更多。”</p>
<p>I thought about it for a moment．It was not as good as being a governess in an important family，but at least I would have no master．I would be free and independent．</p>
<p>我考虑了一会儿。和在大家庭中做家庭教师相比，这不算好，但至少我没有什么主人了，我是自由和自立的。</p>
<p>'Thank you，Mr Rivers，I accept gladly，'I replied．</p>
<p>“谢谢，李维斯先生，我很乐意接受。”我说。</p>
<p>'But you do understand？'he asked，a little worried．'It will only be a village school．The girls will be poor and uneducated．You'll be teaching reading，writing，counting，sewing，that's all．There'll be no music or languages or painting．'</p>
<p>“但是你明白吗？”他有些担心地问。“这只是一所乡村小学。女孩子们很穷，没有受过教育。你要同时教<a href="http://www.tingvoa.com/English_News/" target="_blank" class="infotextkey">阅读</a>、写作、算术和缝纫。没有音乐、语言或绘画课。”</p>
<p>'I understand，and I'll be happy to do it，'I answered．</p>
<p>“我明白，我乐意做。”我答道。</p>
<p>He smiled，well satisfied with me．</p>
<p>他微笑着，对我非常满意。</p>
<p>'And I'll open the school tomorrow，if you like，'I added．</p>
<p>“如果你愿意，我明天就开学。”我补充道。</p>
<p>'Very good，'he agreed．Then looking at me，he said，'But I don't think you'll stay long in the village．'</p>
<p>“很好。”他应和着，然后看着我说：“但我觉得你在村里不会久留的。”</p>
<p>'Why not？I'm not ambitious，although I think you are．'</p>
<p>“为什么呢？我没有什么雄心壮志，不过我觉得你有。”</p>
<p>He looked surprised．'I know I am，but how did you discover that？No，I think you won't be satisfied by living alone．You need people to make you happy．'He said no more．</p>
<p>他看上去很吃惊。“我知道我有，可你是怎么发现的？不，我觉得你不会满足于孤独的生活，你需要别人给你带来快乐。”他没再说什么。</p>
<p>Diana and Mary lost their usual cheerfulness as the moment for leaving their home and their brother came closer．</p>
<p>随着离家和离开哥哥的日子一天天临近，戴安娜和玛丽渐渐失去了平日的欢乐。</p>
<p>'You see，Jane，'Diana explained，'St John is planning to become a missionary very soon．He feels his purpose in life is to spread the Christian religion in unexplored places where the people have never heard the word of God．So we won't see him for many years，perhaps never again！He looks quiet，Jane，but he's very determined．I know he's doing God's work，but it will break my heart to see him leave！'And she broke down in tears．</p>
<p>“简，你知道，”戴安娜解释道。“圣约翰计划不久去做传教士。他认为自己生命的意义在于把基督教传播到人们从未听说过上帝之言的蛮荒之地去。所以我们好几年都将见不到他，甚至可能再也见不到了。简，他看上去文静，但却很坚定。我知道他为上帝工作，但看他离去让我心都碎了。”她哭了出来。</p>
<p>Mary wiped her own tears away，as she said，'We've lost our father．Soon we'll lose our brother too！'</p>
<p>玛丽擦着自己的眼泪，说：“我们失去了父亲，不久又要失去哥哥！”</p>
<p>Just then St John himself entered，reading a letter．'Our uncle John is dead，'he announced．The sisters did not look shocked or sad，but seemed to be waiting for more information．St John gave them the letter to read，and then they all looked at each other，smiling rather tiredly．</p>
<p>正在这时圣约翰读着一封信走了进来，“咱们的舅舅约翰去世了。”他宣布说。两姊妹看上去既不吃惊也不悲伤，却似乎在等着什么下文。圣约翰把信递给她们看，然后她们相互对视一眼，疲倦地笑了。</p>
<p>'Well，'said Diana，'at least we have enough money to live on．We don't really need any more．'</p>
<p>“好了，”戴安娜说，“至少我们有足够的钱生活下去。我们真的不需要那么多。”</p>
<p>'Yes，'said St John，'but unfortunately we can imagine how different our lives might have been．'He went out．There was a silence for a few minutes，then Diana turned to me，'Jane，you must be surprised that we don't show any sadness at our uncle's death．I must explain．We've never met him．He was my mother's brother，and he and my father quarrelled years ago about a business deal．That's when my father lost most of his money．My uncle，on the other hand，made a fortune of twenty thousand pounds，As he never married and had no relations apart from us and one other person，my father always hoped we would inherit uncle John's money．But it seems this other relation has inherited his whole fortune．Of course we shouldn't have expected anything，but Mary and I would have felt rich with only a thousand pounds each，and St John would have been able to help more poor people！'She said no more，and none of us referred to the subject again that evening．</p>
<p>“是的。”圣约翰说。“但不幸的是我们能想像出我们的生活是多么不一样。”他出去了。沉默了几分钟后，戴安娜对我说：“简，我们对舅舅的死显不出一点儿悲哀，你不必惊讶。我必须解释一下。我们从未见过他。他是我母亲的一个兄弟，多年前他和我父亲因为生意上的事大吵了一常那时我父亲亏了很多钱，而我舅舅却发了财，赚了20 000英镑。他从未结婚，除我们和另一个人之外也没有亲戚，我父亲一直希望我们能继承约翰舅舅的财产。但是似乎另一个人已继承了他的全部遗产。当然我们本不该指望什么，但如果每人有1 000英镑，玛丽和我就会觉得很富裕了，圣约翰也能帮助更多的穷人了。”她没有再说下去，那天晚上谁也没再提起此事。</p>
<p>The next day the Rivers family returned to their separate places of work，and I moved to the cottage in Morton．</p>
<p>第二天，李维斯一家各自回到不同的工作地点，而我则搬到莫顿的小屋子去了。</p><a href='21.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
