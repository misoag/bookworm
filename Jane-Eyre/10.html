<p><b>10 格丽丝&middot;普尔之谜 </b></p>
<p>A fter this sleepless night I was eager to see Mr Rochester in the morning，but there was no sign of him．He had obviously told the servants that he had accidentally set fire to his room by knocking over a lighted candle As I passed his bedroom，I saw Grace Poole sitting inside，calmly mending the curtains She certainly did not look desperate or mad enough to have tried to murder her master But I decided to investigate．</p>
<p>度过一个不眠之夜后，早晨我很想见到罗切斯特先生，但是根本没有他的人影。显然他已经告诉仆人们他不小心碰翻了蜡烛，使房间着火了。经过他的房间时，我看见格丽丝&middot;普尔坐在里面，平静地补着窗帘。她看上去根本不像绝望或疯狂到要杀死主人的地步。但我还是决定探个究竟。</p>
<p>Good morning，Grace，I said，entering the room．'Tell me，what happened last night？The servants are talking about it．'</p>
<p>“早上好，格丽丝。”我说着走进屋里。“告诉我，昨晚出了什么事？仆人们都在议论呢。”</p>
<p>'Good morning，miss，'she replied， looking up innocently．'Well，master was reading in bed and fell asleep，so he must have knocked the candle over It set fire to the sheets，but luckily he managed to put the flames out with some water．</p>
<p>“早上好，小姐。”她回答着抬起头来，没事儿似的。“嗯，主人躺在床上看书睡着了，他肯定是碰翻了蜡烛。蜡烛点着了床单，好在他用水把火扑灭了。”</p>
<p>'How strange！'I said quietly．'Didn't anybody hear what was happening？At this，she seemed to examine me carefully．</p>
<p>“多怪啊！”我轻声说。“没有人听到动静吗？”听到这话，她好像仔细打量了我一眼。</p>
<p>Mrs Fairfax and you sleep nearest this room，miss Mrs Fairfax is a heavy sleeper，like most old people，and didn't hear anything But you'rs young，miss．Perhaps you heard a noise？' 'I did，'I whispered．'I'm sure I heard a strange laugh．'</p>
<p>“费尔法斯太太和你睡得离他最近，小姐。费尔法斯太太像大多数老年人一样，睡得很沉，没听见什么。不过，小姐，你还年轻。也许你听到了动静？”</p>
<p>She went on sewing calmly</p>
<p>“是的。”我说，“我敢肯定我听到了一声怪笑。”</p>
<p>'I don't think master would have laughed，when he was in such danger，'she said．'You must have been dreaming．'</p>
<p>她继续平静地干着手中的针线活。</p>
<p>'No，I wasn't dreaming，'I replied sharply． 'You didn't think of opening your door and looking out into the corridor？'she asked．I suddenly realized that if she suspected I knew of her guilt，she might attack me．</p>
<p>“处在这样的危险之中，我想主人是不会笑的。”她说，“你一定在做梦。”</p>
<p>'No，in fact I locked my door，'I answered，'and I shall lock it every night from now on．'</p>
<p>“不，我没有做梦。”我厉声答道。</p>
<p>That's wise of you，miss We might have burglars at Thornfield one day，you never know．</p>
<p>“你没想起要开门朝走廊里看看？”她问。我突然意识到如果她怀疑我知道她的罪过，可能会袭击我。</p>
<p>I was amazed by her self-control，and could not understand why Mr Rochester had not asked the police to arrest her，or at least dismissed her from his service．Why had he asked me to keep the attack a secret？How could such a proud gentleman be so much in the power of one of his servants that he could not even punish her for trying to kill him？Did she know a terrible secret fron his past，which she had threatened to tell？Could he ever have been in love with her？'NO，I thought，'he could never love anyone as plain and coarse as she is．But then，I'm not beautiful either，and I sometimes think he loves me．Last night-his words，his look，his voice!'And my cheeks were red as I thought of those precious moments</p>
<p>“不，我把门锁上了。”我说，“从今往后我每天晚上都会锁门。”“小姐，这才是明智的。谁知道呢，也许有一天特恩费得会闯进盗贼的。”她的自我克制让我吃惊，我纳闷为什么罗切斯特先生不叫警察抓她或至少解雇她。为什么他要我保守秘密？一个那么骄傲的绅士怎么能这样被自己的仆人左右，那人即使要杀他也不能予以惩罚呢？她是不是知道他过去的什么可怕的秘密，要挟要讲出来呢？他是不是曾经爱过她？“不，”我心想，“他永远不会去爱这么个平淡粗俗的人。可是我也不漂亮呀，但有时我觉得他爱我。昨天夜里——，他的话，他那眼神，他那声音！”想到那些珍贵的瞬间，我的双颊不禁红了。</p>
<p>I was now even more impatient to see Mr Rochester，but when I was having tea with Mrs Fairfax in the afternoon，the first thing she said was，It's fine weather for the master's journey．'</p>
<p>现在我更加急不可耐地想要见到罗切斯特先生，但下午我和费尔法斯太太喝茶时，她第一句话就是：“今天天气不错，正适合主人旅行。”</p>
<p>'Journey!'I cried．'I didn't know he'd gone anywhere!'</p>
<p>“旅行！”我叫着，“我不知道他已经到别处去了。”</p>
<p>'Oh yes，he went off just after breakfast，to visit a family in a big house about sixteen miles away．I know they've invited a lot of guests，who'll be staying in the house．Mr Rochester is always very popular with the ladies at these parties，so he may not come back for a week or so．'</p>
<p>“噢，是的，他早饭后就走了、去拜访16英里外的一户人家。我知道他们请了许多客人，都住在家里。在这种晚会上罗切斯特先生总是很受女士们的欢迎，所以他可能会个把星期不回来。”</p>
<p>'Who are the ladies at this house-party？</p>
<p>“这次晚会上有哪些女士？”</p>
<p>'Three sisters，very elegant young ladies，and their friends，Blanche and Mary Ingram．But Blanche is the most beautiful of all．I saw her when she came to a Christmas party at Thornfield，six or seven years ago．'</p>
<p>“三姐妹，都是文雅的年轻女士，还有她们的朋友布朗蒂和玛丽&middot;英格姆，可布郎蒂是其中最漂亮的一个。六七年前在特恩费得的圣诞晚会上我见过她。”</p>
<p>'What does she look like？'</p>
<p>“她什么样儿？”</p>
<p>'She was eighteen then，a lovely girl，with beautiful skin，long curling black hair，and fine black eyes which shone as brightly as her jewels．She looked like a queen．All the gentlemen admired her，not only for her beauty but also for her musical skills．When she and Mr Rochester sang together，it was a delight to hear．'</p>
<p>“她当时18岁，非常可爱，有好看的皮肤，长长的鬈发，美丽的黑眸子像珠宝一样闪着光。她就像个皇后。所有的绅士都喜欢她，这不仅因为她美，还因为她有音乐才华。她和罗切斯特先生一起唱歌时，那听起来非常悦耳。”</p>
<p>'Mr Rochester？I didn't know he could sing．'</p>
<p>“罗切斯特先生？我不知道他会唱歌。”</p>
<p>'Oh yes，he has a very fine voice．And then she played the piano later．The master said she played extremely well．'</p>
<p>“噢，是的，他嗓子很好。然后她弹钢琴，主人说她弹得非常出色。”</p>
<p>'And this beautiful lady isn't married yet？'</p>
<p>“这位漂亮的女士还没有结婚？”</p>
<p>'No，I don't think she or her sister has much money．'</p>
<p>“没有，我想她或她妹妹都没什么钱。”</p>
<p>'But I'm surprised some rich gentleman hasn't fallen in love with her．Mr Rochester，for example．He's rich，isn't he？'</p>
<p>“但是我奇怪怎么没有哪位富有的绅士爱上她，比如说罗切斯特先生。他很富，是不是？”</p>
<p>'Oh yes But you see，there's a considerable difference in age．He's nearly forty，and she's only twenty-five．'</p>
<p>“噢，是的。可你知道．年龄差得太多。他快40岁了，而她只有25岁。”</p>
<p>'Well，marriages like that happen every day．De you think-'But I was interrupted by Adele，who came to Join us，and the subject was changed．</p>
<p>“不过，这样的婚姻天天都有。你觉得——”但我被阿黛拉打断了，她来找我们，话题也就变了。</p>
<p>That night in my room I was stern with myself．</p>
<p>当晚我在房间里严厉地剖析自己。</p>
<p>'You，Jane Eyre，'I accused my reflection in the mirror，'you are the biggest fool in the world! How could you imagine that a gentleman of family and wealth would love you，a plain little governess! Just look at yourself!'And I decided that next day I would draw an honest sketch of myself，and then one of Blanche Ingram，painting the most lovely face I could imagine，according to Mrs Fairfax 's description．In the future，if ever my old feelings about Mr Rochester began to return，I would only have to glance at the two pictures to see the great difference between us，and in this way common sense would destroy my foolish dreams.</p>
<p>“你，简&middot;爱，”我指责着镜中的我，“你是世界上最大的傻瓜！你怎么能想象一位有家有产的绅士会爱上你这个不起眼的小家庭教师呢！好好看看你自己吧！”我决定第二天老老实实地画一张自画像，再给布朗蒂&middot;英格姆画一张，根据费尔法斯太太的描述，画出我能想像的最迷人的脸蛋儿。今后如果我对罗切斯特先生旧情复发，我只要看看两幅画，看看我们之间的巨大差别就够了。这样理智就会打破我愚蠢的梦。</p><a href='11.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
