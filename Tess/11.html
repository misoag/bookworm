<p>It was July and very hot． The atmosphere of the flat valley hung like a drug over the dairy people， the cows and the trees． It was Sunday morning after milking． Tess and the other three girls dressed quickly to go to Mellstock Church，which was three or four miles away from Talbothays． Heavy thunderstorms had poured down the day before， but today the sun shone brightly and the air was warm and clear．When the girls reached the lowest part of the road to Mellstock， they found it was flooded． In working clothes and boots they would have walked through， but they were wearing Sunday white stockings and thin shoes which they did not want to ruin． The church bell was calling， still a mile away．</p>
<p>到了7月，天气非常炎热。悬浮在平坦的山谷中的大气就像麻醉剂一般，笼罩着奶场的人们、奶牛和树木。这是挤完奶后的一个星期天的早晨。苔丝和另外三个姑娘急匆匆地换上衣服，准备到梅尔斯托克教堂去，那儿距塔尔勃塞有三四英里远。前一天刚下过很大的暴雨，今天却阳光明媚，空气温和清新。当姑娘们走到通向梅尔斯托克那条路的最低的一段时，发现这一段路被洪水淹没了。平时穿着工作服和靴子，她们走过去就行了。但今天她们穿着做礼拜才穿的白袜子和薄鞋子，她们可不想把它们都毁了。还有一英里路，教堂的钟声已经响了。</p>
<p>Suddenly they saw Angel Clare approaching． He had seen them from far away， and had come to help them， one of them in particular．</p>
<p>突然，她们看到安吉尔&middot;克莱尔正朝这边走近。他远远就看见她们了，是过来帮助她们的，特别是她们中的某一个。</p>
<p>‘I'll carry you through the water， all of you，’he offered．All four blushed as if they had one heart．</p>
<p>“我把你们都抱过水去，你们所有人。”他开口提供帮助。四个人的脸不约而同地全红了，好像心有灵犀。</p>
<p>‘Now， Marian， put your arms round my shoulders． Hold on！’ and Angel walked off with her in his arms． Next was lzz Huett．Her lips were dry with emotion． Angel returned for Retty． While he was picking her up， he glanced at Tess． He could not have said more plainly，‘ It will soon be you and I．’There was an understanding between them．</p>
<p>“现在，玛丽安，用你的手臂抱住我的肩膀，抱紧点！”然后安吉尔抱起她走了。下一个是伊茨&middot;休爱特。她激动得嘴唇都干了。然后安吉尔又回来接蕾蒂。当他抱起她时，他瞥了一眼苔丝。他用不着更直接了当地说：“很快就到你和我了。”他们之间存在着一种默契。</p>
<p>It was now Tess's turn． He picked her up． She was embarrassed to discover her excitement at his nearness．</p>
<p>这下轮到苔丝了。他把她抱了起来。当她发现自己因他的贴近而激动时，她有些局促不安。</p>
<p>‘Three plain girls to get one beauty，’he whispered．</p>
<p>“抱过三个相貌平平的姑娘，就为了抱一个漂亮的。”他轻轻说道。</p>
<p>‘They are better women than I，’ she said bravely．</p>
<p>“她们是比我更好的姑娘，”她勇敢地说。</p>
<p>‘Not to me，’ said Angel． She blushed． There was silence．Clare stood still and bent his face to hers．</p>
<p>“对我来说不是，”安吉尔说道。她的脸又红了。一阵沉默后，克莱尔站住了，低下头，把自己的脸靠近苔丝的脸。</p>
<p>‘Oh Tessy！’he said． Her cheeks were pink and she could not look into his eyes． But he respected her modesty and did nothing more． He walked slowly， however， to make the journey as long as possible， and put her down on dry land． Her friends were looking with round thoughtful eyes at them．He said goodbye and went back by the road．</p>
<p>“哦，苔丝！”他轻唤道。她的脸颊微微红着，不能直视他的眼睛。出于对她的端庄的尊重，他没有再做出什么。然而，他走得很慢，尽可能地延长这段行程。然后他把她放在了干地上。她的朋友们都瞪圆了眼睛，关切地注视着他们。他说了声再见就沿原路返回了。</p>
<p>The four walked on together． Marian broke the silence by saying，‘No， we have no chance against her！’She looked joylessly at Tess．</p>
<p>四个人继续往前走着。玛丽安打破了沉默，说道：“不，在她面前我们没有机会！”她闷闷不乐地看着苔丝。</p>
<p>‘What do you mean？’asked Tess．</p>
<p>“你这是什么意思？”苔丝问道。</p>
<p>‘He likes you best， the very best！We saw as he brought you over． He'd have kissed you if you had encouraged him， only a little．’</p>
<p>“他最喜欢你！最最喜欢！当他抱你过来时，我们都看到了。如果你鼓励他的话，哪怕只有一点点鼓励，他就会吻你的。”</p>
<p>They were no longer cheerful but they were not bitter．They were generous country girls who accept that such things happen．Tess's heart ached．She knew that she loved Angel Clare， perhaps all the more passionately because the others also loved him．And yet that same hungry heart of hers pitied her friends．</p>
<p>她们的愉快心情一扫而光，但她们也并不怀恨在心。她们都是宽厚的乡下姑娘，能够接受这种事情的发生。苔丝的心在作痛。她知道她爱安吉尔&middot;克莱尔，也许这种爱变得更强烈了，因为其他姑娘也在爱着他。然而，正是她那颗充满渴望的心，对她的朋友们产生了同情。</p>
<p>‘I will never stand in your way！’ she cried to them that evening in the bedroom．‘I don't think he's thinking of marrying， but even if he asked me， I'd refuse him， as I'd refuse any man．’</p>
<p>“我将永远不会妨碍你们的！”那天晚上在卧室里，她向她们宣布，“我认为他并没有在考虑结婚，但是即使他向我求婚，我也会拒绝他的，就像拒绝任何其他男人一样。”</p>
<p>‘Oh why？’they asked．</p>
<p>“哦，为什么？”她们问。</p>
<p>‘I cannot marry！ But I don't think he will choose any of you．</p>
<p>“我不能结婚！但是我认为他不会选择你们中任何一个的。”</p>
<p>So the girls remained friends． They all shared each other's secret． The air in their bedroom was full of their hopeless passion． There was a flame burning the inside of their hearts out． But because they had no hope， they were not jealous of each other．They had even heard that Angel's family were planning for him to marry a neighbour's daughter． Tess no longer attached any importance to Clare's interest in her．It was a passing summer attraction， nothing more．</p>
<p>这样，姑娘们还是朋友。她们互相分享彼此的秘密。她们卧室的空气中充斥着没有希望的热情。她们的心被激情燃烧着。但是因为她们不抱任何希望，她们之间也就没有妒忌。他们甚至还听说，安吉尔的家人正打算让他娶一个邻居的女儿。克莱尔对她的关注对苔丝来说，已不再有任何重要性。这只是一次夏天的、转瞬即逝的吸引，仅此而已。</p>
<p>The heat grew steadily greater． In this stormy atmosphere even a passing attraction would deepen into love． Everything in nature was ready for love．Clare became gradually more passionately in love with the soft and silent Tess． The fields were dry． Waggons threw up clouds of dust on the road． Cows jumped over gates， chased by flies． Dairyman Crick's sleeves were rolled up from Monday to Saturday， and the milkers milked in the fields for coolness．</p>
<p>气温不断地升高。在这多风暴的空气中，甚至短暂的吸引都会成为深深的爱慕。自然中的一切事物都为爱作好了准备。克莱尔对温柔沉静的苔丝的爱也越来越炽烈了。地是干的，马车驶过，扬起一片尘烟。奶牛跳过栅门，被一群苍蝇追逐着。奶场主克里克卷起袖子从星期一干到星期六，为了图凉快，工人们都在地里挤奶。</p>
<p>On one of these afternoons Tess and Angel were milking near each other． Tess used to rest her head on the cow's body，her eyes fixed on a distant field． The sun shone on the beautiful lines of the face． She did not know that Clare had followed her round and sat watching her． How very lovable her face was to him． He had never seen such beautiful lips and teeth， like roses filled with snow．</p>
<p>就在这样的一个下午，苔丝和安吉尔在相距不远的地方挤着奶。苔丝习惯于把头靠在奶牛的身上休息，眼睛注视着远方的田野。阳光照在她脸庞秀美的轮廓上。她不知道克莱尔已经跟着她过来了，正坐着观看她。那是张多么讨人喜欢的脸啊！他从来没有见过如此美丽动人的唇齿，恰如含雪的玫瑰一般。</p>
<p>Suddenly Clare jumped up， leaving his bucket to be kicked over by the cow， went quickly towards her， and， kneeling down beside her， took her in his arms． Tess let herself relax in his arms in a moment of joyful surprise． He was on the point of kissing that tempting mouth， but stopped himself．</p>
<p>突然，克莱尔从坐的地方一跃而起，顾不上奶牛是否会把奶桶踢翻，快速地向她跑去。他跪在她身旁，把她搂进了怀里。那一刻，苔丝又惊又喜，她让自己依顺地偎在了他的怀里。他差点就要亲吻那张充满诱惑的小嘴了，但他抑制住了自己。</p>
<p>‘Forgive me， Tess dear！’he whispered．‘I ought to have asked．I love you， Tess really！’</p>
<p>“请原谅我，苔丝，我亲爱的！”他轻声说道，“我本来应该问问你的。我爱你，苔丝，真的！”</p>
<p>Tess tried to free herself and her eyes began to fill with tears．</p>
<p>苔丝想从他怀里挣脱出来，她的眼里开始噙满泪水。</p>
<p>‘Why are you crying， my darling？’he asked．</p>
<p>“为什么哭，亲爱的？”他问。</p>
<p>‘Oh I don't know！’ she murmured， trying to pull away．</p>
<p>“哦，我不知道！”她轻声说道，试图脱身走开。</p>
<p>‘Well， I've shown my feeling at last， Tess，’he said with a curious sigh， showing that his heart had overcome his reason．‘I do love you dearly and truly． But I shall go no further now．I have surprised you．’</p>
<p>“嗯，我终于向你表露了我的真情，苔丝，”他有些奇怪地叹了口气，说道。这表明他的情感战胜了他的理智。“我真地爱你，真心诚意地爱你，但是现在我不该有过分的表示，我吓着你了。”</p>
<p>She freed herself and they went on milking． Nobody had noticed， and when Dairyman Crick came round there was no sign to show that there was any connection between them． Yet something had happened which was to change their whole world． As a practical man， the dairyman might laugh at love，but love has a habit of changing people's lives．It is a force to be respected．</p>
<p>她从他怀里挣脱出来，他们又开始挤奶了。没有人注意到他们，当奶场主克里克走过来时，没有任何迹象表明他们之间有什么瓜葛。然而，事情已经发生了，并将改变他们的整个世界。作为一个讲究实际的人，这位奶场主可能会嘲笑爱情，但是爱情惯于改变人们的生活。这是一种应该受到尊敬的力量。</p><a href='12.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
