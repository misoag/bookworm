<p>This desperate cry for help eventually arrived at the parson's house in Emminster．Old Mr Clare was pleased．</p>
<p>这封绝望的求助信最终到了爱敏斯特牧师的家中，老克莱尔先生很高兴。</p>
<p>‘I think this letter is from Angel's wife．I hope this will bring him home more quickly．He did say he was planning to come home next month．’</p>
<p>“我想这是安吉尔的妻子来的信。我希望这会让他更快地回家。他是说过，他计划下个月回家的。”</p>
<p>‘Dear boy，I hope he will get home safely，’murmured Mrs Clare．‘I still feel he should have gone university like the other two．He should have had the same chance as them，Church or no Church．’</p>
<p>“亲爱的孩子，我希望他能平安到家。”克莱尔夫人低声说道，“我仍然觉得他应该像其他两个那样去上大学，他应该和他们有同样的机会，不管是不是到教会工作。”</p>
<p>This was the only complaint she ever made to her husband．He too was worried that he had been unfair to Angel．They blamed themselves for this unfortunate marriage．If Angel had studied at Cambridge he would never have become a farmer and married a country girl．Still，his more recent letters showed that Angel was planning to come home to fetch her， so perhaps their quarrel，whatever it was， could be settled．</p>
<p>这是她有史以来唯一一次向她的丈夫发牢骚。他自己也为他没有公平地对待安吉尔感到忧虑。他们为这桩不幸的婚姻责备自己。假如安吉尔在剑桥学习的话，他就永远不会成为一个农场主，也不会跟一个乡下姑娘结婚了。不过，安吉尔最近一次的来信表明他仍打算回家带她一起去，所以他们的争吵，不管是为了什么，也许可以解决了。</p>
<p>Angel himself was at this moment riding across Brazil towards the coast．He had never completely recovered from the serious illness he had had when he first arrived．He was not as strong as before，and looked much older．The country had been a disappointment to him．Many farmers had come here from England hoping to make their fortune，and had died in the fields or on the roads．He knew now he could not farm here．</p>
<p>安吉尔自己这个时候正骑马横穿巴西到海岸。他一到这儿就生了场大病，以后再也没有彻底恢复过来。他已经不如以前那么健壮了，看起来也老了许多。这个国家让他失望了。许多从英国来的农场主，怀着发家致富的梦想到了这儿，却死在了地里或路上。他知道他无法在此经营农场了。</p>
<p>His attitude to life had changed during this time． He began to look again at what was right and wrong．He began to see that a person should be judged not only on what he has done but also on what he wanted to do．He began to think that he had perhaps been unfair to Tess，and he thought about her with growing affection．</p>
<p>在这期间，他对生活的态度已发生了转变。他开始再度审视起是非曲直来。他开始明白，评判一个人不仅仅要根据他做过什么，还要根据他想做什么。他开始想到自己过去对待苔丝也许是不公平的，他怀着与日俱增的爱恋，回想着她。</p>
<p>He wondered why she had not written．He forgot that he had told her not to write first．He did not realize that she was obeying his orders exactly，although it was breaking her heart．</p>
<p>他纳闷她为什么不给他写信。他忘了，他说过不要先来信的。他没有意识到她在完完全全地服从他的命令，尽管这叫她伤心欲碎。</p>
<p>On his journey，he travelled with another Englishman．They were both depressed and both told each other their problems．The stranger was older and more experienced than Angel．He had a different，more open approach to life．He told Angel clearly that he was wrong in parting from Tess．</p>
<p>在行程中，他和另外一个英国人结伴而行。他们都很沮丧，彼此倾诉着自己的问题。这位陌生人比安吉尔年长，阅历也更丰富。他对生活的态度有自己不同的、更为豁达开朗的一套。他明确地对安吉尔说，他离开苔丝是错误的。</p>
<p>The next day they got wet in a thunderstorm．The stranger fell ill and died a few days later．Death came as no surprise in that unfriendly land．Clare buried him，and continued his journey．The man's words were somehow given greater importance by his unexpected death，and suddenly Clare felt ashamed．Tess had committed no crime． He should believe in her character，and not object to a past action she could not avoid．He remembered the words of Izz Huett：She would have laid down her life for you．No woman could do more．How she had looked at him on their wedding day—as if he were a god！And during that terrible evening by the fireside，when she told him her story，how desperately sad she had been to realize he might not love her any more．</p>
<p>第二天，他们赶上一场雷阵雨，被浇湿了。这个陌生人病倒了，几天之后便死去了。在那种环境恶劣的地方，死神的降临是不足为奇的。克莱尔将他安葬了，又继续自己的行程。由于这出人意料的死亡，他的话不知怎地显示出了更大的重要性，克莱尔突然感到羞愧了，苔丝并没有犯罪。他应该相信她的品质，而不是对她无法避免的一段过去横加指责。他回想起了伊茨&middot;休爱特说的话：她可以为你舍弃她的生命。没有任何一个女人能付出更多了。在他们结婚的那天，她是带着怎样的眼神凝视着他呀——仿佛他是一个神！而在火炉边度过的那个可怕的夜晚，当她对他说了她的经历后，意识到他可能不再爱她时，她又是多么地伤心欲绝啊！</p>
<p>Meanwhile Tess was not hopeful that Angel would come in answer to her letter．The past had not changed，so he might not change either．Nevertheless she spent her spare time preparing for his possible return，practising singing the songs he used to like，tears rolling down her cheeks all the while．</p>
<p>同时，苔丝对安吉尔会响应她的信而回来不抱什么希望了。过去并没有改变，所以也许他也没有改变。然而，她还是利用空闲的时间，为他可能的返回作着准备，练习唱他过去爱听的歌，每到这个时候，眼泪就会从她的双颊潸潸滚落。</p>
<p>One evening she was in the cottage as usual when there was a knock at the door．A tall thin girl came in and Tess recognized her young sister Liza－Lu．</p>
<p>一天晚上，像往常一样，她正待在小屋里，这时响起了一阵敲门声。一个高高瘦瘦的女孩走了进来，苔丝认出，是她的妹妹丽莎－露。</p>
<p>‘Liza－Lu！’said Tess．‘What's the matter？’</p>
<p>“丽莎－露！”苔丝说，“出什么事儿啦？”</p>
<p>‘Mother is very ill，’her sister said seriously，‘and father is not well either and says a man of such noble family shouldn't have to work．So we don't know what to do．’</p>
<p>“妈妈病得很重，”她的妹妹焦虑地说道，“爸爸的身体也不好，还说像这样一个高贵家族的人是不该工作的。所以我们不知道如何是好。”</p>
<p>Tess thought for a moment．She realized she had to go home immediately，although her time was not yet up at the farm．She left her sister to rest for a while，and she herself set off at once with her possessions in a basket．</p>
<p>苔丝想了一会儿。她意识到自己必须立即回家一趟，尽管她在农场的干活期未满。她让妹妹留下来休息一会儿，自己把行李装在一个篮子里，即刻启程了。</p>
<p>Although it was night and she had a fifteen－mile walk， she felt quite safe．She was only worried about her mother， and did not notice the strange shapes of trees and hedges in the darkness．At three in the morning she passed the field where she had first seen Angel Clare，and felt again the disappointment when he did not dance with her．And when she saw the family cottage， it seemed to be part of her body and life，as it always did．</p>
<p>虽然是夜里了，她还有15英里的路要走，但她觉得十分安全。她只是担心她的母亲，根本注意不到黑暗中那些树木和篱笆怪异的影子。凌晨3点，她经过与安吉尔&middot;克莱尔初次见面的田野，因他没有请她跳舞产生的失望又一次涌上心头。她看到她们家的房子，它就像她身体和生活的一部分。它总是这样的。</p>
<p>She found her mother recovering from her illness，and took over as head of the household．Her father did not seem ill，and had a new plan for earning money．</p>
<p>她发现她母亲正从病中恢复，又接管了一家的事务，她的父亲则不像生病的样子，还制定了一个挣钱的新计划。</p>
<p>‘I'm going to find all the historians round here，’he said，‘and get them to pay money to keep me going．After all，they pay to look after old ruins，and I'm of historical interest．I think they'll be pleased to do it！’</p>
<p>“我打算找到周围地区的所有的历史学家，”他说道，“让他们出钱支持我的生活。毕竟，他们是要花钱照看那些历史古迹的，我也有历史价值，我认为他们会乐意这么做的！”</p>
<p>Tess did not have time to answer．She nursed her mother，fed the children，and worked in the garden，planting vegetables for next year．She enjoyed working outside，among her neighbours．One evening when it was almost dark，she was digging happily in the vegetable garden，some distance from the cottage．It was a clear，fresh night，with smoke blowing about from small fires in the gardens．Suddenly she saw a man's face in the light of a fire．It was d’Urberville！She gasped and stepped back，her face pale．</p>
<p>苔丝没有工夫回答他的话。她要看护母亲，喂养孩子，还要在园子里干活儿，为来年种点儿蔬菜。她喜欢跟左邻右舍一起，在户外干活儿。一天傍晚，天将黑时，她在菜园子里欢快地掘着土。园子离家有些距离。这是一个明朗、清新的夜晚。园子里的小火堆升起了一团团的烟雾，突然，她在火光中看到了一张男人的脸，是德伯！她惊得透不过气来，后退了几步，脸变得惨白。</p>
<p>‘What are you doing here？’</p>
<p>“你在这儿干什么？”</p>
<p>‘My dear Tess，I just want to help you，to see you． Have you finished at that farm？’</p>
<p>“我亲爱的苔丝，我只不过想要帮助你，看望你。你在那个农场的活儿结束了吗？”</p>
<p>‘Yes，I have．’</p>
<p>“是的，结束了。”</p>
<p>‘Where are you going next？To join your dear husband？’</p>
<p>“下一步你要去哪里？和你亲爱的丈夫团聚？”</p>
<p>‘Oh，I don't know！’she said bitterly．‘I have no husband！’</p>
<p>“哦，我不知道！”她愤愤地说，“我没有丈夫！”</p>
<p>‘That is quite true in one way．But you have a true friend．When you go back to your cottage，you'll see what I've done for you．’</p>
<p>“从某种意义上说，这是相当正确的，但是你有一个真正的朋友。当你回到你的屋子时，你会看到我为你做的事情。”</p>
<p>‘Oh Alec，I wish you wouldn't give me anything！I—I have enough，I—I just don't want to live at all！’Her tears fell as she started digging again．When she looked round，d’Urberville had left．</p>
<p>“哦，亚历克，我真希望你什么都不要给我！我——我已经有足够的了，我——我根本就不想活了！”当她重新开始掘土时，已是泪流满面了。她环顾四周，德伯已经走了。</p>
<p>On her way back one of her sisters rushed towards her shouting，‘Tess！Tess！Mother is much better but father is dead！’</p>
<p>在回家的路上，她的一个妹妹朝她飞奔而来，叫着：“苔丝！苔丝！妈妈好多了，可是爸爸死了！”</p>
<p>‘But father was only a little bit ill！’said Tess，trying to take in the news．</p>
<p>“可是爸爸只有一点小小的病！”苔丝说道，极力领会这个消息的涵义。</p>
<p>‘He dropped down just now，and the doctor said there was no hope for him because it's his heart！’</p>
<p>“他刚才跌倒了。医生说因为他心脏的毛病，他没有救活的希望了！”</p>
<p>Poor John Durbeyfield's death had more importance than his family realized at first．The cottage was in his name．On his death the farmer who owned it decided to put farm workers in it，and told the Durbeyfields to leave．They were not much respected in the village because of John's laziness．Tess also felt guilty that her presence might have influenced the farmer．The village people clearly thought she was not a good example for their children．</p>
<p>可怜的约翰&middot;德北的去世所带来的影响比他的家人最先意识到的更为重大。这座房子是以他的名义使用的。因为他死了，农场主——也就是房主人决定让农场工人们住到这里，叫德比一家都搬走。因为约翰的懒惰，他们家在村子里不太受敬重。苔丝也感到很愧疚，也许她的存在影响了那个农场主。村子里的人们都明确地认为她不是弟妹们的好榜样。</p>
<p>So on Lady Day the Durbeyfields had to leave their old home．The night before they left，d’Urberville came to visit Tess，to offer her and her family a little house on his land at Trantridge．Her mother could look after the chickens，and he would pay for the children to go to school．Tess firmly rejected his offer．But when he had gone，for the first time a feeling of anger rose in her against her husband．She had never intended to do wrong and he had punished her too hard！She passionately wrote these few words to him：</p>
<p>于是在圣母领报日那天，德北一家不得不离开了他们的老房子。离开的前一天晚上，德伯来看望苔丝，提出把在纯瑞脊他的土地上的一间房子给她和她的家人祝她的母亲可以为他养鸡，他则可以出钱供孩子们上学。苔丝严厉地拒绝了他的帮助。可是当他离开之后，她内心第一次产生了对她丈夫愤怒的感觉。她从来没有存心要做错事，他对她的惩罚太残酷了！她满怀激情地写了下面几句话：</p>
<p>Oh why have you treated me so badly，Angel？I do not deserve it．You are cruel！I intend to forget you．You have been so unfair to me！</p>
<p>啊，安吉尔，你为什么对我这么狠哪？这不是我应受的惩罚，你真是残酷！我要设法忘掉你。你对待我太不公平了！</p>
<p>T</p>
<p>苔</p>
<p>She ran out and posted it before she could change her mind．</p>
<p>她跑出去，趁着她还没有改变心意赶忙寄了这封信。</p>
<p>‘I see there's been a visitor，’said her mother，coming into the living room later．‘Your husband， was it？’</p>
<p>“我看有人来拜访过了，”她母亲随后来到了起居室，说道，“是你的丈夫，对吗？”</p>
<p>‘No，it wasn't him．He'll never，never come，’said Tess hopelessly．She had said it was not her husband，but she was feeling more and more that d’Urberville was physically her husband．</p>
<p>“不，不是他。他永远、永远也不会来的。”苔丝绝望地说道。她说了来者不是她的丈夫，可是她却越来越感到，德伯是她实质上的丈夫。</p>
<p>Next day their possessions were put on a waggon and taken to Kingsbere．Mrs Durbeyfield had booked rooms there，as it was the family home of the d’Urbervilles，and she still hoped some good would come of belonging to the ancient family．But as they approached Kingsbere after a long and tiring day's journey，a man came to tell them there were no rooms available．Tess and her mother unloaded the waggon，and left the children and furniture near the churchyard wall，while they looked for somewhere to stay．But all the rooms were full．</p>
<p>第二天，他们的家当被装上了一辆运货马车，带到王陴那儿。德北夫人在那儿订了房间，因为那儿是德伯家族的房产，并且由于归属于这个古老的家族，她仍然抱着从中能出现什么好事的希望。可是经过一天漫长又疲惫的旅行之后，在临近王陴时，有个人来告诉他们这儿已经没有空余的房间了。苔丝和她母亲从货车上卸下东酉，把孩子和家具留在教堂墓地围墙附近，她们自己则去寻找能住的地方。但是所有的房子都是满满的。</p>
<p>Tess looked desperately at the pile of their possessions． In the cold sunlight of this spring evening the furniture looked old and the pots looked worn．</p>
<p>苔丝绝望地看着这一堆家当。在这春天傍晚冷冷的日光下，家具看起来很破旧，而锅碗瓢盆都是破破烂烂的。</p>
<p>‘Tombs belong to families for ever，don't they？’asked her mother brightly，having looked round the churchyard．‘Well，that's where we'll stay，children，until the place of your ancestors finds us some shelter！’</p>
<p>“坟墓永远属于家族所有，是不是？”在环顾了教堂墓地之后，她的母亲欢快地问道。“好了，孩子们，在你们祖先的地位给我们找到避难所之前，这就是我们要待的地方。”</p>
<p>Tess helped her mother move the big bed against the church wall．Underground were the tombs of the d’Urbervilles，and at the head of the bed was a beautiful old window，in which the symbols on the Durbeyfield seal and spoon could be seen．The children were put to bed all together for warmth and comfort．</p>
<p>苔丝帮助她母亲把那张大床移到靠着教堂墙壁的位置。地下就是德伯家族的坟墓，床前有一个漂亮古老的窗格，里面可以见到德伯印章和银匙上的标记。为了保暖和舒适起见，孩子们统统上了床，挤在一起。</p>
<p>‘Tomorrow we'll find somewhere better！’said Joan cheerfully．‘But Tess，what's the good of you playing at marrying gentlemen， if it leaves us like this！’</p>
<p>“明天我们会找到一个更好的地方！”琼乐观地说道。“可是苔丝，你随随便便地嫁给绅士先生们得到了什么好处，如果我们落到这个地步的话！”</p>
<p>Tess went inside the ancient church and stared sadly at the tombs of her ancestors．She thought she saw a movement and turned to look again at a stone figure lying on a tomb．When she saw it was Alec d’Urberville lying there，she almost fainted．</p>
<p>苔丝走进了这座古老的教堂，忧伤地盯着她祖先们的坟墓。她觉得她看到了什么东西在动，掉过头去又看了一眼，坟墓上躺着一个僵硬的身子。当她认出是亚历克&middot;德伯躺在那儿时，她几乎要昏厥过去了。</p>
<p>‘I'm going to help you，’he said，jumping up and smiling at her．‘You'll see that I'm more useful than a real d’Urberville．I'll see your mother．You'll thank me for this！’As he brushed past her，she dropped her head on to the cold stone of the tomb．</p>
<p>“我打算帮助你，”他跳起来，笑着对她说道。“你会看到我比一个真正的德伯家的人更有用处。我要去见你的母亲。你会为此感激我的！”当他从她身边擦肩而过时，她对着坟墓冰冷的石块垂下了头。</p>
<p>‘Why am I on the wrong side of this stone？’she whispered．</p>
<p>“我为什么不是在墓石的另一边？”她喃喃说道。</p>
<p>Marian and Izz had seen Tess moving house with her family，and knew what a difficult position she was in．They generously hoped she would one day be happy with Angel again，and were afraid for her，knowing that Alec d’Urberville was constantly tempting her．They decided to write a letter to Angel Clare，to inform him of the dangerous situation his wife was in．This is what they wrote：</p>
<p>玛丽安和伊茨知道苔丝和她的家人搬家了，也了解她处在一个怎样的困境当中。她们宽厚地希望有一天她会重新和安吉尔幸福地生活在一起。她们也为她担心，因为她们知道那个亚历克&middot;德伯在不断地诱惑她。她们决定给安吉尔&middot;克莱尔写封信，通知他有关他妻子的危险处境。这是她们写的内容：</p>
<p>Dear Sir，</p>
<p>敬爱的先生：</p>
<p>Watch out for your wife if you love her as much as she loves you．She is in danger from an enemy in the shape of a friend．A woman's strength cannot last for ever，and water，if it drops continually，will wear away a stone—yes，even a diamond．</p>
<p>如果您爱您的妻子也像她爱您那样深的话，请关心她吧。她正受到一个伪装成朋友的敌人的威胁。一个女人的力量是不能永无止境地持续下去的。如果不停地滴落，水都能穿石——是的，即使是钻石也会被磨光的。</p>
