<p>As the carriage drove on through Blackmoor Vale，Tess now began to awake from her sorrow and wonder how she could face her parents．She left the carriage and came into Marlott on foot．When she entered the little cottage， her mother was doing the washing as usual．</p>
<p>当马车穿越黑荒野山谷继续行驶时，苔丝渐渐从悲痛中醒转过来，开始思考该怎样面对她的父母。她下了马车，步行进入马勒特村。当她走进那间小农舍时，她母亲一如往常地在洗着衣服。</p>
<p>‘Why Tess！’she cried when she saw her daughter．‘I thought you were married！Really married this time！’</p>
<p>“苔丝，为什么？”她看到她女儿，不由得叫了起来，“我以为你结婚了！这次是真的结婚了吧！”</p>
<p>‘Yes，mother，I am．’</p>
<p>“是的，妈妈，结婚了。”</p>
<p>‘Then where's your husband？’</p>
<p>“那么，你的丈夫呢？”</p>
<p>‘Gone away for a time．’</p>
<p>“要离开一段时间。”</p>
<p>‘Gone away！When were you married then？Tuesday，as you said？’</p>
<p>“离开！那么，你们是什么时候结婚的？如你说的，星期二？”</p>
<p>‘Yes，mother．’</p>
<p>“是的，妈妈。”</p>
<p>‘Married on Tuesday and today it's only Saturday，and he's gone away！What strange husbands you seem to find，Tess！’</p>
<p>“星期二结婚，今天才不过是星期六，他就已经走了。看来你是找了一个非常奇怪的丈夫啊，苔丝！”</p>
<p>‘Mother！’Tess ran across to Joan and put her head on Joan's shoulder．‘You told me I mustn't tell him．But I did-I couldn't help it—and he went away！’</p>
<p>“妈！”苔丝朝琼奔去，把她的头伏在琼的肩上，“你嘱咐我不要告诉他，但是我说了——我忍不住——然后他走了！”</p>
<p>‘Oh you fool，you little fool！’cried her mother．</p>
<p>“哦，你这个傻瓜，你这个小傻瓜！”她母亲喊道。</p>
<p>‘I know，I know，’sobbed Tess．‘But he was so good！I couldn't lie to him．And if only you knew how much I loved him and how much I wanted to marry him！’</p>
<p>“我知道，我知道，”苔丝哭诉着，“可是他原来是那么好的人！我不能对他撒谎。如果你知道我是多么地爱他，多么地想嫁给他，你就会明白了！”</p>
<p>‘Well，it's too late now，’said Mrs Durbeyfield．‘Whatever will your father say？ He was very proud of your marriage．He's been telling them at the public house that you'll help his noble family become great again．Oh，there he is now！’</p>
<p>“唉，现在已经太迟了，”德北夫人说道，“真不知道你父亲会怎么说？他对你的婚姻非常地自豪。他在酒店里跟他们说，你会帮忙把他的高贵家族重新振兴起来。哦，他来啦！”</p>
<p>Tess ran upstairs，but through the thin walls she could hear the whole story being told to Sir John．</p>
<p>苔丝跑到楼上去了。但是透过薄薄的墙壁，她听到了向约翰爵士叙述的整个事件。</p>
<p>‘People will laugh at me in the village！’he said．‘Do you think he really did marry her，Joan？Or is it like the first？’</p>
<p>“村里人会笑话我的！”他说，“你认为他真地跟她结婚了吗，琼？还是就像头一次那样？”</p>
<p>Tess could listen no more．Even her own family did not believe her．She could not stay．She gave her mother half the money which Clare had given her，and told her family she was going to join him．And so she left Marlott again，looking for work．</p>
<p>苔丝再也听不下去了，甚至她的家人都不信任她。她无法待在这儿了。她把克莱尔留给她的钱分出一半，给了她母亲，并告诉家里人，她打算去和他团聚。于是她又一次离开了马勒特，去找活儿干。</p>
<p>Angel Clare also returned home．He had spent three weeks since his wedding trying to remain calm and continue his studies，but with the disturbing picture of Tess always in his mind．He was beginning to wonder if he had treated her unfairly．She had been so much a part of his plans for the future that he was now thinking of countries where they could farm together．The idea of Brazil attracted him．The countryside，people and habits would be so different．Perhaps they could make a new life there together．So he went back to Emminster to tell his parents his new plan．</p>
<p>安吉尔&middot;克莱尔也回到了家里。从婚礼之后，他花费了三周的时间试图让自己保持平静并继续学习，但他脑子里总不断地闪现出苔丝的影子，搅得他心神不安。他开始思索自己是不是对她做得太过分了。她曾是他未来生活计划中如此重要的一部分，以至于他现在还在考虑他们可以一起去哪些国家经营农常巴西对他颇具吸引力。那儿的乡村、那儿的居民和风俗都与此地截然不同，也许他们可以一起在那儿开创新的生活。于是他返回爱敏斯特，告诉他父母他的新打算。</p>
<p>‘But where's your wife，dear Angel？’cried his mother when he arrived．</p>
<p>“亲爱的安吉尔，可是，你的妻子呢？”当他到家时，他母亲喊道。</p>
<p>‘She's at her mother's for the moment．I've come home in rather a hurry，because I've decided to go to Brazil．’</p>
<p>“她这会儿在她娘家，我是相当匆忙地赶回家的，因为我已经决定了要去巴西。”</p>
<p>‘Brazil！But they're all Roman Catholics there！’</p>
<p>“巴西！但是那儿都是罗马天主教徒！”</p>
<p>‘Are they？I hadn't thought of that．’</p>
<p>“是吗？我还没想过这个呢。”</p>
<p>But Mr and Mrs Clare were even more interested in their son's marriage than in Brazil's religion．</p>
<p>但是比起巴西的宗教来，克莱尔先生和克莱尔夫人对他们儿子的婚姻大事更为关切。</p>
<p>‘Angel，we do want to meet your wife．We are not in the least angry about this rather hurried wedding，so why haven't you brought her？It seems strange．’</p>
<p>“安吉尔，我们真地想见见你的妻子。对你这次草率的婚礼，我们丝毫没有生气。那么，为什么你不把她带来？这显得有点奇怪。”</p>
<p>Angel explained that she would be staying at her mother's while he went to Brazil alone to see if the country was suitable．He planned to bring her to meet his parents before he went there a second time，with her．But his mother was disappointed at not seeing Tess．She watched her son as he ate，and asked questions．</p>
<p>安吉尔解释说，在他单独赴巴西考察那个国家是否适合期间，她先住在娘家。他安排好了，在下次他和她一起去巴西之前，带她来见他的父母。但他的母亲对于没有见到苔丝非常失望。她看着儿子吃饭，还问了些问题。</p>
<p>‘Is she very pretty？’</p>
<p>“她很漂亮吗？”</p>
<p>‘She certainly is！’</p>
<p>“那是毫无疑问的。”</p>
<p>‘And a maiden of course？’</p>
<p>“自然是个少女喽？”</p>
<p>‘Of course．’</p>
<p>“自然是的。”</p>
<p>‘I imagine you were her first love？’</p>
<p>“我想你是她的初恋吧？”</p>
<p>‘Exactly．’</p>
<p>“正是。”</p>
<p>His father asked no questions，but when the moment for evening prayers arrived，he chose a passage from the Bible．</p>
<p>他的父亲什么也没问，但是到晚上做祈祷的时刻，他从《圣经》里挑选了一段文章。</p>
<p>‘This passage is very suitable，as you are here，Angel．It is in praise of a pure wife．’</p>
<p>“安吉尔，这一段非常适合现在这个场合，这是赞美纯洁的妻子的。”</p>
<p>‘We shall all think of her as your father reads it，’ added his mother．As they listened to the ancient，beautiful words，Angel felt like crying．</p>
<p>“当你父亲读这段话时，我们都会想到她。”他母亲加了一句。当他听着这些古老、优美的辞句时，安吉尔简直要哭了。</p>
<p>His mother said，‘You see，Angel，the perfect woman，the Bible tells us，is a working woman，not a fine lady，a girl just like your wife．A girl who uses her hands and heart and head for others．I wish I could have met her，Angel．As she is pure，she is fine enough for me．’</p>
<p>他的母亲说：“安吉尔，你看，《圣经》告诉我们，完美的女人是一个勤劳的女人，就像你的妻子那样的姑娘，一个用自己的双手、心灵和头脑为别人奉献的姑娘，而不是一位体面的小姐。安吉尔，我真希望我见过她了。我觉得她已经够好了，因为她是个纯洁的姑娘。”</p>
<p>Clare's eyes were full of tears．He quickly said goodnight and went to his room．His mother followed and stood at his door looking anxiously at him．</p>
<p>克莱尔的眼眶里满是泪水。他迅速地道了晚安，就到自己的房间去了。他的母亲跟了过去，站在门口忧虑地看着他。</p>
<p>‘Angel，why are you going away so soon？Have you quarrelled with your wife in these three weeks？Angel，is she …is she a woman with a past？’The mother's instinct had found the cause of her son's worries．</p>
<p>“安吉尔，你为什么这么快就要离去了？这三个星期里，你和你的妻子吵架了吗？安吉尔，她是……她是一个有经历的女人吗？”做母亲的本能发现了儿子忧虑的原由。</p>
<p>‘She is totally pure！’he replied，and felt that he had to tell that lie，even if he went to hell there and then for it．</p>
<p>“她是完全纯洁的！”他回答道，他觉得自己一定要撒那个谎，哪怕他要为此在此时此地下地狱。</p>
<p>‘Then never mind the rest．There are few better things in nature than a pure country girl．’</p>
<p>“那就永远不要在乎别的方面。自然界里很难再有比一个纯洁的乡村姑娘更好的事物了。”</p>
<p>Clare felt furious with Tess，because she had forced him to deceive his parents．Then he remembered her sweet voice， and the touch of her fingers on his face，and her warm breath on his lips．But this well－meaning young man，despite his advanced ideas，was still limited in his thinking．He could not see that Tess was in character as pure as the pure wife in the Bible．</p>
<p>克莱尔对苔丝感到非常愤怒，因为她逼得他欺骗他的父母。随后，他又想起了她温柔甜美的声音，她的手指在他脸上轻轻触摸的感觉，还有她在他唇上温暖柔和的呼吸。但是这个本意善良的年轻人，尽管有先进的思想，在思维上却不免仍有局限。他不能看到，在本质上，苔丝与《圣经》中描述的圣洁的妻子是一样纯洁的。</p>
<p>The next day Clare left Emminster and began to prepare for his journey to Brazil．One day，returning from doing some business with a farmer，he happened to meet one of the dairymaids from Talbothays，Izz Huett．He knew her secret：she was an honest girl who loved him and who might have made as good a farmer's wife as Tess．He learnt from Izz that，of the other dairymaids，Retty had become ill，and Marian had started drinking．And Izz herself？</p>
<p>第二天，克莱尔离开了爱敏斯特，开始为去巴西的行程作准备。一天，在同一位农场主了结了一些事情后的返回途中，他碰巧遇上了塔尔勃塞的一个挤奶女工，伊茨&middot;休爱特。他知道她心里的秘密，她爱他，是个诚实的姑娘，而且能成为一个和苔丝一样贤惠的农场主妻子。他从伊茨口中得知了一些其他女工的情况。蕾蒂病倒了，玛丽安开始酗酒。伊茨自己怎么样呢？</p>
<p>‘Suppose I had asked you to marry me，Izz？’he asked．</p>
<p>“伊茨，假设我请求过你嫁给我，会怎么样？”他问。</p>
<p>‘I would have said“yes”，and you would have had a woman who loved you！’</p>
<p>“我会说‘好吧’，然后你就拥有了一个爱你的女人！”</p>
<p>A wild anger took hold of Clare．Society and its rules had trapped him in a corner．Why shouldn't he take his revenge on society？</p>
<p>一种疯狂的愤怒占据了克莱尔的思想。社会和它的法则设下圈套把他逼到了死角，为什么他不向这个社会报复？</p>
<p>‘I'm going to Brazil，Izz，without Tess．We have separated for personal reasons．I may never be able to love you，but will you come with me？’</p>
<p>“伊茨，我将要去巴西了，苔丝不跟着去。我们因为一些私人的原因分手了。可能我永远也不会爱你，但是，你愿意和我一起去吗？”</p>
<p>‘Yes，I will，’said Izz after a pause．</p>
<p>“是的，我愿意，”沉默了一会儿，伊茨说道。</p>
<p>‘You know it's wrong in the eyes of the world，don't you？Do you love me very much？More than Tess？’</p>
<p>“你知道这在世人的眼里是不对的，是不是？你非常非常爱我吗？爱得比苔丝还深？”</p>
<p>‘I do，yes，oh，I do love you，but not more than Tess．Nobody could！She would have laid down her life for you．’</p>
<p>“是的，我爱你，哦，我确实很爱你，但是爱得没有苔丝深。没人能这样！她可以为了你舍弃她的生命。”</p>
<p>Clare was silent．A sob rose inside him．He heard Izz's words again and again in his head：She would have laid down her life for you．</p>
<p>克莱尔哑然无语，他的心在哭泣。他听到伊茨的话一遍又一遍地在脑子里响起：她可以为了你舍弃她的生命。</p>
<p>‘I'm sorry，Izz，’he said suddenly．‘Please forget what I said just now！I must be mad！’</p>
<p>“我很抱歉，伊茨，”他突然说道，“请你忘掉我刚才说的话吧！我一定是疯了！”</p>
<p>‘Oh please take me！Oh，I shouldn't have been so honest！’sobbed Izz．</p>
<p>“哦，带我去吗？喔，我不应该那么老实！”伊茨呜咽着说。</p>
<p>‘Izz，by your honesty you have saved me from doing something wicked．Thank you for that．And please forgive me！’</p>
<p>“伊茨，你的诚实挽救了我，使我避免了一件罪恶的事情。我要因此感谢你，也请你原谅我！”</p>
<p>And so Angel said goodbye to the miserable girl．But he did not turn towards Tess's village．He continued with his plan，and five days later left the country for Brazil．</p>
<p>于是安吉尔告别了这个可怜的姑娘。但他并没有转回到苔丝的村子。他继续按他的计划行事，五天之后，他离开这个国家到巴西去了。</p>
<p>And so the months passed．Tess found occasional dairy work for the spring and summer．She sent all Angel's money to her family，who as usual had many expenses and hardly any income．She was too proud to ask Angel's family for more money．That winter she went to work at another farm，where Marian was working．Here the earth was poor，and the work was difficult．But Tess did not mind the hard work in the fields．As she and Marian dug out the vegetables in the pouring rain，they talked of Talbothays and of the sunny green fields and of Angel Clare．Tess did not tell Marian everything，so Marian could not understand why the couple were apart．</p>
<p>时间一个月又一个月地过去了。春夏两季，苔丝就在牛奶场找点临时的活儿干。她把安吉尔留下的钱都寄给了家里，这个家像往常一样总有许多支出，却几乎没有什么收入。她的自尊不允许她向安吉尔的家人伸手要钱。那个冬天她转到另外一个农场干活。玛丽安就在那儿干活儿。这里的土地贫瘠，活儿也很辛苦。但是苔丝并不介意在地里干那些繁重的活儿。当她们淋着倾盆大雨在地里挖菜时，她们就讲讲塔尔勃塞，讲讲阳光明媚的绿色牧场，还有安吉尔&middot;克莱尔。苔丝没有把事情的来龙去脉都告诉玛丽安，所以玛丽安无法理解为什么这对夫妇会分开。</p>
<p>They wrote to Izz，asking her to join them if she had no other work．It was the coldest winter for years，but Tess and Marian had to go on working in the snow．Tess realized that the farmer was the same Trantridge man who had recognized her in the market town，and had been knocked down by Angel．He made her work twice as hard as the others．</p>
<p>她们给伊茨写信，叫她来跟她们一起干，如果她没别的活儿干的话。这是几年来最冷的一个冬天，可是苔丝和玛丽安必须顶着雪花干活儿。苔丝意识到农场主就是那个在集镇上认出她来的纯瑞脊人，曾经被安吉尔击倒在地。他让她干的活儿比其他人的加重了一倍。</p>
<p>When Izz came，Tess saw her whispering to Marian．Tess had a feeling it was important．‘Is it about my husband？’she asked Marian later．</p>
<p>当伊茨到来时，苔丝见她跟玛丽安耳语着什么。苔丝感觉这一定是件重要的事。“是有关我丈夫的事吗？”之后，她向玛丽安问道。</p>
<p>‘Well yes，Izz said I shouldn't tell．But he asked her to run away to Brazil with him！’</p>
<p>“嗯，是的，伊茨说我不应该告诉你。可是，他叫她跟他一起私奔到巴西去！”</p>
<p>Tess's face went as white as the snow on the ground．</p>
<p>苔丝的脸变得像地上的雪一样惨白。</p>
<p>‘What happened？’</p>
<p>“后来呢？”</p>
<p>‘He changed his mind．But he was going to take her！’</p>
<p>“他改变了主意。但是他原来是打算带她去的！”</p>
<p>Tess burst out crying．‘I must write to him！It's my fault！I shouldn't have left it to him！He said I could write to him！I've been neglecting him！’</p>
<p>苔丝放声大哭起来。“我必须给他写信！这是我的过错！我原不该把这事留给他去做的！他说过我可以给他写信！我一直都疏忽他了！”</p>
<p>But in the evening，in her room，she could not finish her letter to him．She looked at her wedding ring，which she wore round her neck in the day，and kept on her finger all night．What kind of husband would ask Izz to go to Brazil with him so soon after parting from his wife？</p>
<p>可是到了晚上，她在房间里给他写信时，又写不下去了。她盯着她的结婚戒指，她在白天把它挂在脖子上，到了晚上就整夜把它戴在手上。与妻子分离后，这么快就叫伊茨和他一起去巴西了，这是什么样的丈夫呢？</p>
<p>But this new information made her think again of visiting Angel's family in Emminster．She wanted to know why he had not written to her．She could meet his parents，who would surely be kind to her in her loneliness．So she decided to walk there from the farm at Flintcomb－Ash on a Sunday， her only free day．It was fifteen miles each way．She dressed in her best，encouraged by Marian and Izz，who sent her on her way at four o’clock in the morning．The girls sincerely loved Tess and wished for her happiness．It was a year since her wedding，and on that bright cold morning her unspoken hope was to win over her husband's family and so persuade him back to her．</p>
<p>但是这个新信息让她重新考虑起到爱敏斯特拜访安吉尔的家人。她想知道为什么他没有给她写信。她可以见见他的父母，在她孤苦伶仃的时候，他们一定会善待她的。于是她决定在一个她唯一空闲的日子，礼拜天，从弗林特石灰谷的农场出发，步行去那儿。单程的路就有15英里。在玛丽安和伊茨的怂恿下，她穿上了最好的衣服。她们在那天清晨4点钟把她送上了路。姑娘们都真挚地爱着她，由衷地希望她幸福。现在距她结婚的日子已有一年了，在那个睛朗寒冷的早晨，她那不曾说出口的愿望就是赢得她丈夫的家人，然后说服他回到她的身边。</p>
<p>Although she started cheerfully，she began to lose her courage as she approached Emminster．The church looked forbidding．Perhaps the rather strict parson would not approve of her travelling so far on a Sunday．But she had to go on．She took off her thick walking boots and hid them behind a tree，changing into her pretty shoes．She would collect the boots on the way out of town．</p>
<p>虽然她出来时欢欣鼓舞，但是随着渐渐走近爱敏斯特，她却开始心慌了。教堂显得令人生畏。也许那位相当严格的牧师会不赞许她在礼拜日长途跋涉。可是，她只有往前走了。她脱下笨重的靴子，把它们藏到一棵树后面，然后，换上那双精致漂亮的靴子。她想在出镇的路上再把靴子捡回来。</p>
<p>She took a deep breath and rang the bell at the parson's house．Nobody answered．She tried again．Silence．It was almost with relief that she turned and walked away．Then she suddenly remembered that they must all be at church．So she waited in a quiet part of the street until people began to stream out of church．She immediately recognized Angel's brothers and even overheard some of their conversation．</p>
<p>她深深地吸了口气，按响了牧师家的门铃。没有人答应。她又按了一次。还是没有动静。她几乎是松了口气，转身离开了。然后她想起来他们一定都在教堂呢。于是她就在街上一个安静的地方等着，直到人们川流不息地从教堂出来了。她马上认出了安吉尔的哥哥们，甚至还远远地听到了他们的谈话。</p>
<p>‘Poor Angel！’one of them said．‘There's that nice girl，Mercy Chant．Why on earth didn't he marry her instead of rushing into marriage with a dairymaid？’</p>
<p>“可怜的安吉尔！”其中一个说道，“默茜&middot;钱特，那个好姑娘在那儿。到底为什么他不娶她，而是跟一个挤奶工仓促地结了婚？”</p>
<p>‘It's certainly very strange．But his ideas have always been most odd．’</p>
<p>“这真是很奇怪。不过，他的想法一直是最古怪的。”</p>
<p>They joined Mercy Chant as she came out of church，and walked together along the road Tess had walked into Emminster．</p>
<p>当默茜&middot;钱特从教堂出来时，他们便上前陪同她一起沿着那条苔丝走进爱敏斯特的路走着。</p>
<p>‘Look，here's a pair of old boots，’said one of the brothers，noticing Tess's boots behind the tree．</p>
<p>“看，这儿有一双旧靴子，”兄弟中有一人说道，他发现了苔丝放在树后的靴子。</p>
<p>‘Excellent walking boots，I see，’said Miss Chant．‘How wicked to throw them away！Give them to me．I'll find a poor person who would like them．’</p>
<p>“我觉得，这是很不错的步行靴子。”钱特小姐说道，“这样就扔了，多差劲啊！把它们交给我吧。拿去送给穷人，会有人喜欢的。”</p>
<p>Tess walked quickly past them，tears running down her face．She continued walking as fast as she could away from Emminster．How unlucky that she had met the sons and not the father！Angel's parents would have taken poor lonely Tess to their hearts immediately，as they did every other lost soul，without thought of family or education or wealth．</p>
<p>苔丝匆匆地超过了他们，泪水从她脸上潸潸滚下。她继续尽可能快地走着，离开了爱敏斯特。她是多么不走运啊，碰见的偏偏会是两个儿子，而不是父亲。安吉尔的父母会立即打心底里接受孤苦可怜的苔丝，就像他们对每一个迷失的人做的那样，而不会去考虑他的出身、学识或财富。</p>
<p>She grew more and more tired and depressed as she walked the fifteen miles back to Flintcomb－Ash，where only hard work awaited her．But on the way she noticed a crowd listening to a preacher and she stopped for a while to join them．The preacher was describing with enthusiasm how he had been wicked for years and how a certain parson had pointed it out to him：this had gradually turned him from wickedness．But Tess was more shocked by the voice than the words．She moved round behind the crowd to look at his face．As the afternoon sun shone full on him， she recognized Alec d’Urberville．</p>
<p>在返回弗林特石灰谷的15英里路中，她变得越来越疲惫沮丧，那儿只有繁重的活儿等着她干。可是在半路上，她注意到有一群人正在听一个传道士说着什么。她停下脚步，也去听了一会儿。这个传道士正热情高涨地讲述他多年来曾是如何地品行不端，而一个牧师又是怎样地给他指出来：这让他渐渐地从邪恶中转变过来。但是他的声音比他的讲道更让苔丝震惊。她从人群后绕过去看他的脸，午后的阳光充沛地照在他身上，她认出来了，他是亚历克&middot;德伯。</p><a href='17.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
