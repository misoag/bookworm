<p><b>结果 12 </b></p>
<p>The nights were as hot as the days． Angel Clare could not sleep． He went out into the darkness to think over what had happened that afternoon． He had come as a student of farming to this dairy， thinking he would be here only a short time． He thought it would be a quiet place． From here he could observe the great world outside， before plunging back into it． But the world outside had lost its interest， and the quiet place was now the centre of all feeling．</p>
<p>夜晚与白天一样炎热。安吉尔&middot;克莱尔无法入睡，就来到外面漆黑的夜里，他在思考那天下午发生的事情。他是作为一名学习务农的学生来到这个牛奶场的，原以为在这儿只待一小段时间。他原以为这儿会是一个平静的地方。在他重新投入到外面那个伟大的世界中之前，他可以在这儿冷眼旁观它。但是外部的世界已经失去了它的重要性，而这个平静的地方现在却成了他所有喜怒哀乐的中心。</p>
<p>Clare was a thoughtful， honest man． He knew Tess was not a toy to play with and throw away when finished with． Her life was as important to her as his was to him． He knew he must treat her affection for him seriously． But if they went on meeting every day， their relationship must develop： he could not stop himself．As he had not decided what purpose their relationship should have， he decided that for the moment they should meet as little as possible． But it was not easy to keep to this decision．He was driven towards her by the heat in his blood．</p>
<p>克莱尔是一个善于思考、诚实正直的人。他知道苔丝不是一个用来戏耍的玩偶，在玩过之后就可以丢弃。她的生活对于她与他的生活对于他同等重要。他知道他必须严肃认真地对待她的感情。但是如果他们继续保持天天见面，他们的关系势必会继续发展：他无法阻止自己。因为他还无法断定他们的关系将发展成什么结果，于是他决定在这段时间里，他们应尽量少见面。但执行这样一个决定绝非易事。他沸腾的热血在驱使着他走近她。</p>
<p>He thought he would go and see his family．In less than five months he would have finished his studies here． After a few more months on other farms， he would be ready to start farming himself． Shouldn't a farmer's wife be a woman who understood farming？</p>
<p>他觉得他应该回去见见他的家人。再有不到五个月，他在这儿的学习就要结束了。再到别的农场学习几个月，他就准备开始经营自己的农场了。一个农场主的妻子难道不该是个懂农务的女人吗？</p>
<p>He rode along the narrow road towards Emminster and his parents’ house． His eyes were looking， not at the road， but at next year． He loved her： ought he to marry her？ What would his mother and brothers say？ What would he himself say two years after the wedding？</p>
<p>他骑马沿着一条狭长的道路朝爱敏斯特和他父母的房子走去。他的眼睛在展望着什么，不是路面，而是下一个年头。他爱她：他应该娶她吗？他的母亲和哥哥们会怎么说？他自己在结婚两年后又会怎么说？</p>
<p>As he rode into the village， he saw a group of young girls waiting outside the church． Walking quickly to join them was Miss Mercy Chant， only daughter of his father's neighbour．His parents quietly hoped Angel would marry Mercy one day． She was very good at giving Bible classes， but in Angel's mind was the face of the pretty milkmaid who hardly ever thought of God．</p>
<p>当他骑马进村时，他看到一群年轻姑娘正等候在教堂外面。默茜&middot;钱特小姐正快步走去加入她们，她是他父亲家邻居的独生女。他的父母都暗暗地希望有一天安吉尔能和默茜结婚。她对于传授《圣经》知识非常在行，但安吉尔的心被一张漂亮的面孔占据了，就是那个几乎从没有想起过上帝的挤奶女工的面孔。</p>
<p>His family were delighted，though surprised，to see him．Angel was glad to be at home，and yet he did not feel so much part of the family as he used to． His father's religious belief was very strict， but he was a kind， honest man， and fond of his sons． However， he would have been shocked to know of the pagan pleasure in nature and pretty womanhood experienced by Angel． His mother shared his father's religious views and helped in his church work． His brothers seemed rather unimaginative and narrow-minded， although they were both well educated：they felt that anybody outside the Church or university could not be respected．</p>
<p>尽管有些惊讶，他的家人见到他还是很高兴。回到家安吉尔也感到很愉快，然而他不再像过去那样觉得自己是这个家庭的重要组成部分了。他父亲恪守宗教信条，非常严格，但他是个和善正直的人，深爱着他的孩子们。然而，他若是知道安吉尔从自然界和漂亮女人身上所获得的非基督教的快乐，一定会感到震惊的。他母亲有着同父亲一样的宗教观念，并帮助父亲从事教堂的工作。他的哥哥们看起来相当枯燥死板，而且心胸狭窄，尽管他们俩都受过良好的教育，但他们觉得任何教堂或大学外的人都不应受到尊敬。</p>
<p>As he walked with his brothers， Angel felt that， however lucky they were to have a university education， neither of them really saw life as it was lived． They thought farming was a poor man's job， not suitable for a gentleman． Angel felt all the more determined to keep to his choice．</p>
<p>当他和哥哥们走在一起时，安吉尔感觉到，尽管他们俩很幸运地接受了大学教育，但没有一个能实事求是地看待生活。他们认为务农是穷人的职业，对一个绅士来说是不合适的。安吉尔坚持自己选择的决心更坚定了。</p>
<p>In the evening he spoke to his father alone after prayers． Mr Clare told his son he had been saving the money he would have spent on his university education for him． This encouraged Angel to ask his father what sort of wife a farmer needed．</p>
<p>晚上做完祷告之后，他和父亲单独谈了谈。克莱尔先生告诉儿子，他一直都在积攒那笔该用来给他支付大学教育费用的钱。这让安吉尔有了勇气，问父亲一个农场主需要什么样的妻子。</p>
<p>‘A really Christian woman． Nothing else matters．For example，my neighbour Dr Chant…’</p>
<p>“一个虔诚的基督教徒，别的什么都不重要。比如说，我的邻居钱特医生……”</p>
<p>‘But isn't the main thing that she should be able to milk cows，churn good butter， value animals and direct farm workers？’</p>
<p>“但是难道这点不重要吗？就是她要会挤牛奶，搅制出上等的黄油，珍惜动物，并指导农场工人？”</p>
<p>Mr Clare had clearly never thought of this before．</p>
<p>很明显，克莱尔先生以前从未想过这个方面。</p>
<p>‘Yes，yes， certainly． But I was going to say that you will never find a purer woman than Mercy Chant． Your mother and I would be very happy if you…’</p>
<p>“是的，是的，当然。但我要说的是，你不可能再遇到一位比默茜&middot;钱特更纯洁的姑娘啦。你母亲和我会非常高兴的，如果你……”</p>
<p>‘Yes，yes，Mercy is good， I know．But，father，don't you think that one who is just as good and pure，and who understands farm life as well as the farmer， would be much better？’</p>
<p>“是的，是的，我知道默茜是个好姑娘。但是，爸爸，难道你不认为一位同样纯洁善良的姑娘，像一个农场主一样了解农场生活的姑娘，会更合适吗？”</p>
<p>After much discussion Angel got down to details．He explained he had met a woman who was ideally suited to be a farmer's wife， who went to church reqularly， who was honest， sensitive， intelligent， graceful， pure as snow， and extremely beautiful．</p>
<p>商讨了好一阵之后，安吉尔开始细细阐述。他解释道，他遇上了一位非常适合做农场主妻子的姑娘，她经常去教堂，她真诚、聪慧、机智、可爱，雪一般地纯洁，而且极其美丽。</p>
<p>‘Is she of a good family， like Mercy？’ asked his surprised mother， who had come in during the conversation．</p>
<p>“她是位大家闺秀吗？像默茜一样？”颇感意外的母亲问道，她是在他们谈话时进来的。</p>
<p>‘She is not what we call a lady，’ said Angel firmly．‘ She is a cottager's daughter．What's the advantage of good family to me？ My wife will have to work hard and manage with very little money．’</p>
<p>“她不是一位我们印象中的小姐，”安吉尔毫不退缩地说道，“她是一个农村人家的姑娘。大家闺秀能给我带来什么好处呢？我的妻子要卖力地工作，还要会安排那点微不足道的收入。”</p>
<p>‘Mercy is educated． That has its charm，’ said his mother，looking at him through her silver glasses．</p>
<p>“默茜受过教育，这是她的迷人之处。”他母亲透过她的银边眼镜看着他，说道。</p>
<p>‘I shall help her with her reading． She will learn fast． She's full of poetry， real poetry． She lives what poets only write．And she is a good Christian girl． I'm sure you'll value her for that．’</p>
<p>“我将帮助她读书。她很快就能学会的。她充满了诗意，真正的诗意。她充满诗意地生活着，而诗人们只有在笔下流露这些。而且她还是位虔诚的基督教徒，我相信你们会因为这点珍视她的。”</p>
<p>His parents already doubted Angel's religious belief， so they were almost relieved to hear this of his future wife． They told him not to act in a hurry， but they would like to see her．Although Angel was free to marry or not as he wished， he did not want to hurt his parents， and he accepted their advice．</p>
<p>他的父母已经怀疑安吉尔的宗教信仰了，因此他关于未来妻子的这一番话，倒让他们觉得宽心了。他们叫他别草率行事，表示愿意见见她。尽管安吉尔能够自由地选择结婚或不结婚，但他却不愿伤害他的父母。因此，他接受了他们的建议。</p>
<p>As he set off to return to the dairy and Tess， his father rode with him a little way． Mr Clare was telling his son about the new d’Urberville family who had taken the ancient name and lived near Trantridge． There was a young man and his blind mother． Preaching in the church there one day， Mr Clare had spoken out bravely against the well-known wickedness of young d’Urberville， who， after this， had publicly insulted him when they met later．</p>
<p>当他起身返回奶场和苔丝身边时，他父亲伴他同骑了一段路。克莱尔先生向儿子讲起了那个住在纯瑞脊附近、袭用了这个古老姓氏的新的德伯家庭。家里有一个年轻小伙子和他的双目失明的母亲。有一天在那儿的教堂布道时，克莱尔先生大胆地谴责了年轻人德伯的那些臭名昭著的恶行。此后，在他们碰面时，德伯公然地对他进行了辱骂。</p>
<p>Angel was angry with d’Urberville．Dear father，you should not let yourself be insulted like that！’</p>
<p>安吉尔对德伯感到非常生气。“亲爱的爸爸，你不该让自己被这样辱骂！”</p>
<p>‘It doesn't matter to me． I have a duty to point out where people go wrong． Often men have hit me， but then at least they haven't hit their families． And they live to thank me， and praise God．’</p>
<p>“这对我来说不要紧。我有责任指出人们做错的地方。经常会有人攻击我，但是至少，这样，他们就不会攻击家人了。他们在日后会感激我，赞美上帝。”</p>
<p>‘I hope this young man does the same！’ said Angel warmly．‘But it doesn't seem likely．’</p>
<p>“我希望这个年轻人也能如此！”安吉尔热心地说，“但是看起来不太可能。”</p>
<p>‘We'll hope anyway，’said Mr Clare．‘Maybe one of my words may grow like a seed in his heart one day．’</p>
<p>“不管怎样，我们不要放弃希望。”克莱尔先生说道，“也许我的某一句话有一天会在他心里像种子一样生根发芽的。”</p>
<p>Angel could not accept his father's narrow religious beliefs，but he loved him for his courage． He remembered that his father had not once asked whether Tess had money or not．This lack of interest in money meant that all the brothers would probably be poor for ever， but Angel still admired his father's belief that money was not important．</p>
<p>安吉尔无法接受他父亲狭隘的宗教信仰，但他为他的勇气敬爱他。他想起父亲从来没有问过苔丝是否有钱。这种对金钱的淡漠意味着也许他们兄弟几个会永远地一贫如洗，但是安吉尔仍然钦佩父亲关于金钱并不重要的观念。</p>
<p>When he returned to the dairy，in the sleepy afternoon heat， nobody was awake． Getting up so early in the morning meant the milkers really needed a sleep before the afternoon milking． It was three o’clock， time for skimming．There was a slight noise upstairs，then Tess appeared before his eyes．She did not see him， and stretched one arm up above her head．She yawned like a cat and he saw the red inside of her mouth． Her whole soul breathed out physical beauty． Then her eyes flashed as she recognized him．</p>
<p>当他回到牛奶场时，正值叫人昏昏欲睡的炎热下午，没有人醒着。挤奶工们早上起得如此早，因此在下午工作之前，他们非常需要睡上一觉。现在是3点钟，到了该撇牛奶的时间了。楼上发出了一阵轻微的响动，然后苔丝出现在他的眼前。她没有看见他，正把一只胳膊举过头顶伸展着。她像猫一样打呵欠，他看到了她嘴里红红的东西。她的整个灵魂呼出了她外在的美丽。她发现他时，眼睛猛地一亮。</p>
<p>‘Oh Mr Clar！ How you frightened me—I…’she said，looking glad， shy and surprised at the same time．</p>
<p>“哦，克莱尔先生！你把我吓坏了——我……”她说道，神情里带着喜悦，又带有几分羞涩和惊讶。</p>
<p>Clare stepped forward to put his arms round her．</p>
<p>克莱尔走上前去，拥抱她。</p>
<p>‘Dear， darling Tessy！’he whispered， putting his face to her warm cheek．‘Don't call me Mr Clare any more！ I've hurried back because of you！’</p>
<p>“亲爱的，宝贝苔丝！”他轻唤道，把自己的脸贴到了她温暖的脸颊上。“不要再称呼我克莱尔先生了！我这么匆忙赶回来，就是为了你！”</p>
<p>They stood holding each other， the sun warming them through the window He looked deep into her eyes of blue and black and grey． She looked at him as Eve must have looked at Adam．</p>
<p>他们站立着互相拥抱，阳光透过窗户暖暖地照在他们身上。他深情地注视着她那双又蓝又黑又灰的眼睛，而她看他的眼神尤如夏娃看着亚当。</p>
<p>‘I must go skimming，’she said Together they went to the milk-house．</p>
<p>“我得去撇牛奶了，”她说。于是他们一起去了牛奶贮藏室。</p>
<p>Perhaps the Talbothays milk was not very well skimmed that afternoon． Tess was in a dream as she skimmed．The heat of his love made her feel like a plant under a burning sun．</p>
<p>也许那天下午，塔尔勃塞的牛奶撇得质量不太高。苔丝干活的时候，一直神情恍惚。他的爱的热量让她觉得自己像炎炎烈日烘烤下的一株植物。</p>
<p>‘Theres’ s something very practical that I want to ask you，’he said gently．‘I shall sonn want to marry． Being a farmer， I need a wife who knows all about farms． Will you be that woman， Tessy？’</p>
<p>“我有一个非常实际的问题要问你，”他温柔地说，“我打算不久就结婚。作为一个农场主，我需要一位对农场事务样样通晓的妻子。苔丝，你愿意做这样一位妻子吗？”</p>
<p>She looked quite worried．She had accepted that she could not help loving him， but she had not expected this result．With bitter pain she replied as she had promised herself she would．</p>
<p>“啊，克莱尔先生——我不能成为你的妻子——我不能！”说出这些话时，她的心都要碎了。</p>
<p>‘Oh Mr Clare—I cannot be your wife… I cannot be！’The sound of these words seemed to break her very heart．</p>
<p>“可是，苔丝！”他叫道。对她的回答他大感惊诧，更紧地抱住了她。</p>
<p>‘But Tess！’he said， amazed at her answer and holding her still closer．‘Surely you love me？’</p>
<p>“想必你是爱我的吧？”</p>
<p>‘Oh yes， yes！ And I would rather be yours than anybody's in the whole world！ But I cannot marry you！’cried the sweet and honest voice miserably．</p>
<p>“嗯，是的，爱你！比起世界上任何人来，我都更愿做你的妻子，但是我不能嫁给你！”她难过地用甜蜜而诚实的声音说。</p>
<p>‘Tess， have， you agreed to marry someone else？’</p>
<p>“苔丝，是不是你已经同意嫁给别人了？”</p>
<p>‘No， no！’</p>
<p>“不，不是的！”</p>
<p>‘Then why do you refuse me？’</p>
<p>“那么你为什么拒绝我呢？”</p>
<p>‘Your father is a parson， and your mother will want you to marry a lady，’said poor Tess， desperately trying to find an excuse．</p>
<p>“你父亲是位牧师，你母亲会要你娶一位小姐的。”可怜的苔丝说道，迫切地想找一个借口。</p>
<p>‘No， certainly not， that's why I went home， to talk to them both．’</p>
<p>“不，当然不会，这次我回家的原因，就是要跟他们俩都谈谈。”</p>
<p>‘I feel I cannot—never， never！’</p>
<p>“我觉得自己不能——永远不能，永远不能！”</p>
<p>‘Is it too sudden， my pretty？ I'll give you time． I won't mention it again for a while．’</p>
<p>“是不是太突然了，我的美人儿？我会给你时间的。这会儿，我不再提这件事啦。”</p>
<p>She tried to skim again， but her tears fell so that she could not do it． She could never explain her sadness， even to this her best friend． Clare began to talk more generally， to calm her．He talked about his father's religious views， and the good work he did． He mentioned the insults his father had received from a young man near Trantridge who had a blind mother．</p>
<p>她想接着干活，但是她的眼泪滴落下来，让她无法继续下去。她永远无法解释她的悲伤，哪怕是对这样一个她最亲密的朋友。克莱尔开始用更一般的口气跟她谈话，好让她平静下来。他谈起了他父亲的宗教观念，以及他做的善事。他提起了一个住在纯瑞脊附近的青年辱骂他父亲的事，他有个双目失明的母亲。</p>
<p>Tess now looked hard and worn，and her mouth was tragic．Clare did not notice． They finished skimming and he said to her softly：</p>
<p>现在苔丝的脸变得严峻和焦虑起来，她的嘴显露出了不幸。克莱尔没有注意到。他们撇完牛奶后，他柔声向她问道：</p>
<p>‘And my question， Tessy？’</p>
<p>“苔丝，我的问题怎么样了？”</p>
<p>‘Oh no—no！’ she replied， hopelessly， thinking bitterly of Alec d’Urberville．‘ It can't be！’</p>
<p>“哦，不——不行！”她绝望地回答道，痛苦地想起了亚历克&middot;德伯。“这绝不可能！”</p>
<p>She went out with the other milkmaids to the cows in the fields． Angel watched her moving freely in the air like a swimmer on a wave．He knew he was right to choose a wife from nature， not from civilization．</p>
<p>她和其他挤奶女工一起，朝牧场的牛群走去。安吉尔看着她在户外的空气中自由地移动着步伐，就像水波中的游泳者。他知道他是正确的，他要选择一位来自自然而不是来自文明社会的妻子。</p><a href='13.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
