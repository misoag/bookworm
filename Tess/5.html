<p>The chickens for which Tess was responsible lived in an old cottage on Mrs d’Urberville's land．On her first day Tess had to take some of the chickens to show to their owner．She immediately realized the old lady was blind．Mrs d’Urberville held each bird and felt it carefully to see that it was in good health．At the end she suddenly asked Tess a question．</p>
<p>苔丝要养的鸡关在德伯夫人庄园的一间旧茅舍里。第一天她就要带着几只鸡去见它们的主人。她马上就意识到这个老妇人已经双目失明。德伯夫人一只只地抱过她的鸡，仔细地抚摩着，以便确认它们全都很好。之后，她突然向苔丝问道：</p>
<p>‘Can you whistle？’</p>
<p>“你会吹口哨吗？”</p>
<p>‘Whistle，Ma’am？’</p>
<p>“吹口哨，夫人？”</p>
<p>‘Yes，whistle tunes．I want you to practise and whistle to my birds every day．’</p>
<p>“对，吹点儿曲调。我要你练习每天给我的鸡儿们吹口哨。”</p>
<p>‘Yes，Ma’am．’</p>
<p>“是，夫人。”</p>
<p>Tess was not surprised at Mrs d’Urberville's cold manner，and did not expect any more of such a great lady．However，she did not realize that the old lady had never even heard about the family connection．</p>
<p>苔丝对德伯夫人的冷漠并不感到惊讶，她本来就没对这样一位贵妇人抱更多的期望。然而她并不了解，这个老妇人根本就没听人说起过她们的亲戚关系。</p>
<p>Tess began to enjoy her new work with the chickens，and the next day in the cottage garden she decided to practise whistling as instructed．She was shocked to find that she had completely forgotten how to whistle．Suddenly she noticed a movement behind a tree near the wall．It was Alec d’Urberville．</p>
<p>苔丝开始喜欢上了这份养鸡的差事。第二天，在鸡舍的院子里，她决定奉命练习吹口哨，但她震惊地发现她把怎么吹口哨全给忘光了。突然，她发觉围墙附近一棵树后有响动，是亚历克&middot;德伯在那儿。</p>
<p>‘Well，cousin Tess，’he said，‘I've never seen such a beautiful thing as you！I've been watching you from over the wall．Look，I can give you a lesson or two．’</p>
<p>“喂，苔丝表妹，”他说，“我从来没见过像你这么漂亮的姑娘！我一直在墙这边观察你。瞧，我可以教你一两下。”</p>
<p>‘Oh no you won't！’cried Tess，going back towards the door．</p>
<p>“哦，不，你不能这样。”苔丝叫道，转身朝房门走去。</p>
<p>‘Don't worry，I won't touch you．Just look…’and he showed her how to whistle．From that moment Tess found she could whistle tunes to the birds just as Mrs d’Urberville wanted．And as the weeks passed， she often met d’Urberville in the garden and began to lose her shyness of him．</p>
<p>“别担心，我不会碰你的。看着……”他开始给她示范如何吹口哨。从那以后，苔丝发现自己可以按照德伯夫人的心意对着那些鸡儿吹调子了。几个星期来，她经常在花园里遇见德伯，渐渐地在他面前也就不再感到害羞了。</p>
<p>Every Saturday night the other farm workers from the surrounding area used to go to drink and dance in the market town two or three miles away． On Sundays they would sleep late．For a long time Tess did not go with them．But after a while she wanted a change from her routine and began to go on the weekly trips regularly．She always came home with the others at night， preferring the protection of being in a group．One Saturday night she was in the town looking for her companions as it was time to go home，when she met Alec d’Urberville．</p>
<p>每个星期六晚上，附近地区的农民们都会到两三英里以外的镇上喝酒、跳舞，然后在星期天睡个懒觉。很长一段时间，苔丝都没有跟他们去。但过了一阵子，苔丝想改变一下原来一成不变的生活，就开始有规律地去参加这一周一次的活动。夜里她总是和大伙儿结伴回来，在一群人当中，她可以寻得保护。一个周六的晚上，她正在镇上寻找同伴儿，因为到该回去的时候了。这时，她遇上了亚历克&middot;德伯。</p>
<p>‘What，my beauty？Here so late？’he said，smiling at her．</p>
<p>“怎么了，我的美人儿？这么晚了还在这儿？”他笑着对她说。</p>
<p>‘I'm just waiting for my friends，’she answered．</p>
<p>“我只不过在等我的朋友们。”她回答道。</p>
<p>‘I'll see you again，’he said as she moved away．</p>
<p>“我会再找你的，”当她走开时他说道。</p>
<p>She became worried when she realized the workers were still dancing wildly and would not be going home soon．Again she caught sight of Alec，waiting in a doorway，his cigar glowing red in the dark．Eventually she joined a group wandering home．They had all been drinking，but she felt safer with them than alone．But after a while she became involved in a quarrel with them，and was trying to get away from the angry group，when Alec d’Urberville rode by．He offered to take her home on the back of his horse．She hesitatedt，then accepted．</p>
<p>她看到那些人还在疯狂地跳着舞，不像就要回去的样子，于是变得焦急起来。她又一次看到了亚历克，他正等在门口，雪茄烟在黑暗中闪烁着红光。最后她还是跟着一群人逛着回去，他们全都喝了酒，但是她觉得这样也比孤身一人安全些。但是过了一会儿，她卷入了一场争吵中，正极力想从愤怒的人群中脱开身时，亚历克骑着马过来了。他叫她坐在他的马背上，要带她回去。她犹豫了一下，同意了。</p>
<p>Together they rode along in the dark，Tess holding on to Alec．She was very tired：every day that week she had got up at five．So she did not notice that they were riding off the main road and into The Chase，the oldest wood in England．It began to get foggy，and finally Alec admitted honestly that he was lost．</p>
<p>他们在黑暗中往前骑着，苔丝扶着亚历克。她太累了，那个星期她每天都5点钟起床。因此，她没有注意到他们已经偏离了大道，进入逐猎林，那片英格兰最古老的森林。空气中开始弥漫着雾霭。终于，亚历克老实地承认他迷路了。</p>
<p>‘Put me down here，sir，’cried Tess at once．‘Let me walk home from here．How wrong of you to bring me away from the main road！I knew I shouldn't trust you！’</p>
<p>“放我下马吧，先生。”苔丝立即哭叫道，“让我从这儿走回去！你不该把我从大道带到这儿来，这太过分了！我早知道不该相信你的！”</p>
<p>‘Don't worry，my beauty，’laughed Alec．‘I thought you would enjoy a longer ride on such a lovely night．But I can't let you go．The fog is so bad now that you couldn't possibly find your way．I'll leave you here and go to find out where we are．When I come back，I'll tell you，and you can come with me on horseback or go alone on foot—just as you like．’</p>
<p>“别着急，我的美人儿，”亚历克笑着说，“我以为你会喜欢在这样美丽的夜晚多骑一会儿的。但我不能让你走。现在雾这么大，你是根本找不着路的。我把你放在这儿等着，我去看看我们现在到了哪儿。我回来以后就告诉你。那时，你可以跟我骑马回去，也可以一个人走回去——随你的便。”</p>
<p>She agreed to this．‘Shall I hold the horse？’she asked．</p>
<p>这么一说她便同意了。“我需要牵着马吗？”她问。</p>
<p>‘No，he'll stay quiet，’answered Alec．‘By the way， your father has a new horse today．And the children have some new toys．’</p>
<p>“不，它会乖乖地待着的，”亚历克回答道，“顺便告诉你，你父亲今天有匹新马了，孩子们也得到了一些新玩具。”</p>
<p>‘Was it…was it you who gave them？Oh，how good of you！’murmured Tess with a heavy heart．‘I almost wish you hadn't！’</p>
<p>“是……是你送给他们的吗？哦，真得谢谢你的一片好心！”苔丝心情沉重地嘀咕着，“我真有点儿希望你没这么做！”</p>
<p>‘Tessy，don't you love me just a little now？’</p>
<p>“苔丝，现在你会爱我一点了吧？”</p>
<p>‘I'm grateful，’she admitted，‘but I'm afraid I don't…’and slowly she started to cry．</p>
<p>“我很感激你，”她承认道，“但是，恐怕我并不——”她开始哭了起来。</p>
<p>‘Now don't cry，my dear．Sit here and wait for me．’He made a bed for the tired girl among the dead leaves， and covered her with his coat．He set off into the fog to find out where he was，and came back to find Tess fast asleep． He saw her in her white dress among the leaves， a pale，shining figure in the dark．He bent down and touched her cheek with his．Everywhere there was darkness and silence．The birds and animals slept，safe in and under the trees．But who was looking after Tess？Who was protecting her innocence？</p>
<p>“别哭，我的宝贝儿。现在你就坐在这儿，等我回来吧！”他用枯叶给这疲倦的女孩儿铺了张床，还给她披上了自己的衣服。然后他离开了她，走入大雾中，试图辨别他所在的地方。回来时他发现苔丝早已熟睡。他看到了在一堆树叶中穿着白色衣裙的她，黑暗中一个柔弱、美丽的身影。他俯下身来，用自己的脸颊贴着她的。这儿到处都那么漆黑、静谧。鸟兽们都安全地在树上或树下睡着了。但是有谁会来照料苔丝？又有谁会来保护她的贞节呢？</p>
<p>‘Tess！’said d’Urberville，and lay down beside her．The girl was not strong enough to resist him．</p>
<p>“苔丝！”德伯唤道，并在她身边躺了下来。这个柔弱的女子是无力抵挡他的。</p>
<p>Why was Tess's girlish purity lost？Why does the wrong man take the wrong woman？Why do the bad so often ruin the good？ Why is beauty damaged by ugliness？Thousands of years of philosophy cannot give us the answers to these questions．These things happen， and have always happened． Perhaps in the past，rolling home after a battle，Tess's ancestors，the real d’Urbervilles，had done the same，even more cruelly，to young country girls．But we cannot accept that that is Tess's fault，and should happen to her．As the people of her village say，‘It was to be．’And from now on，Tess's life was to be completely different．</p>
<p>为什么苔丝会失去少女的贞操？为什么不合适的男人要与不合适的女人结合？为什么坏人总是毁灭好人？为什么美丽总被邪恶践踏？数千年来的哲理无法给予我们这些问题的答案。这些事情发生着，总在发生着。也许过去，苔丝的祖先们，那些真正的德伯家的人，在经历了一场战斗返回时，曾对乡村的姑娘们做过同样的事，甚至更残酷的事。但我们不能认为这是苔丝的过错，应由她来偿还。也许就像她村子里的人们说的那样：“这一切都是命中注定的。”从这以后，苔丝的生活就截然不同了。</p><a href='6.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
