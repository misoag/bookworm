<p>When Tess arrived home the following afternoon a letter had already been received by her mother．It appeared to come from Mrs d’Urberville，and offered Tess work looking after chickens． Joan Durbeyfield was delighted．</p>
<p>第二天下午，没等苔丝回到家，她母亲就先收到了一封信。信像是德伯夫人写来的，她给苔丝提供了一份养鸡的差事。琼&middot;德北非常高兴。</p>
<p>‘It's just a way of getting you there without raising your hopes．She's going to recognize you as family，I'm sure of it．’</p>
<p>“这是让你去他们那里，同时不要抱太大希望。我相信她一定会把你当做一家人看待的。”</p>
<p>‘I would rather stay here with father and you，’said Tess，looking out of the window．</p>
<p>“我宁愿留在家里跟你和爸爸在一起。”苔丝看着窗外说。</p>
<p>‘But why？’</p>
<p>“那又为什么？”</p>
<p>‘I'd rather not tell you， mother．I don't really know．’</p>
<p>“还是别对你说的好，妈妈，我也不太清楚。”</p>
<p>A few days later when Tess came back from looking for work， the children came running out and danced round her．</p>
<p>几天过后，当苔丝外出找工作回来时，孩子们都跑了出来，围着她手舞足蹈。</p>
<p>‘The gentleman's been here！’they shouted．</p>
<p>“有位先生来过这儿！”他们嚷嚷道。</p>
<p>Joan was full of smiles． Mrs d’Urberville's son had called，and asked if Tess could come or not．</p>
<p>琼笑意盎然。德伯夫人的儿子来拜访过，他问苔丝还能否去他那儿。</p>
<p>‘He's a very handsome man！’said Mrs Durbeyfield．</p>
<p>“他很英俊！”德北夫人说。</p>
<p>‘I don't think so，’said Tess coldly．‘I'll think it over．’She left the room．</p>
<p>“我可不觉得。”苔丝冷漠地说，“我会仔细考虑的。”说完，她离开了房间。</p>
<p>‘He's in love with her， you can see that，’said Mrs Durbeyfield to her husband．‘No doubt he'll marry her and she'll be a fine lady．’</p>
<p>“看得出来，他爱上她了。”德北夫人对她丈夫说，“毫无疑问，他会跟她结婚的，她就快是一个贵妇人啦。”</p>
<p>John Durbeyfield had more pride in his new-found blood than energy or health．‘That's what young Mr d’Urberville is trying to do！Improve his blood by marrying into the old line！’</p>
<p>与体力或健康相比，约翰&middot;德北更为他那新发现的血统感到自豪。“跟古老的家族联姻，使自己的血统变得更高贵，这就是年轻的德伯先生想要做的事！”</p>
<p>Persuaded by her mother and the children，Tess finally agreed to go．Mrs Durbeyfield secretly made wedding plans．Then the day came when Tess， wearing her best Sunday clothes on her mother's orders，said goodbye to her family．</p>
<p>经过母亲和孩子们的劝说，苔丝终于决定去了。德北夫人则暗自筹划着婚礼。到了要走的那天，苔丝依照母亲的吩咐穿上了最好的节日礼服，跟家人告别了。</p>
<p>‘Goodbye，my girl，’said Sir John，waking from a short sleep．‘Tell young d’Urberville I'll sell him the title，yes，sell it，at a reasonable price．’</p>
<p>“再见，我的孩子。”约翰爵士说道，他刚刚睡了一小觉。“告诉年轻的德伯，我愿意把爵士头衔卖给他。对，卖给他，如果价钱合理的话。”</p>
<p>‘Not for less than a thousand pounds！’cried Lady Durbeyfield．</p>
<p>“少于一千英镑就不卖！”德北夫人喊道。</p>
<p>‘No，tell him he can have it for a hundred！No，fifty， no—twenty！Yes，twenty pounds，that's the lowest．Family honour is family honour and I won't take any less！’</p>
<p>“不，告诉他一百也行！不，五十，不，二十！对，二十英镑是最低价了。家族荣誉到底是家族荣誉，再少我就不干了！”</p>
<p>Tess felt like crying but turned quickly and went out．Her mother went with her to the edge of the village．There she stopped and stood waving goodbye，and watched her daughter walking away into the distance． A waggon came to take her bags，and then a fashionable little carriage appeared．It was driven by a well-dressed young man smoking a cigar．After a moment's hesitation，Tess stepped in．</p>
<p>苔丝直觉得想哭，但她还是迅速转身走了。她母亲陪她走到了村头。在那儿停住，挥手道别后，母亲就看着女儿渐渐走远了。一辆货车驶过来，装上了苔丝的行李，然后又有一辆时髦的小马车出现在她面前。驾车的是一个抽着雪茄、穿着讲究的年轻人。苔丝犹豫了一下，然后上了车。</p>
<p>Joan Durbeyfield，watching，wondered for the first time if she had been right in encouraging Tess to go． That night she said to her husband，‘Perhaps I should have found out how the gentleman really feels about her．’</p>
<p>琼&middot;德北瞪大了眼睛，头一次怀疑起她鼓励苔丝去到底正确与否。那天晚上，她对丈夫说：“也许我应该先弄清楚那位先生对她的真实感情才对。”</p>
<p>‘Yes，perhaps you ought，’murmured John，half asleep．Joan's natural trust in the future came back to her．</p>
<p>“是的，也许你该这样。”约翰嘀咕着，半睡半醒。琼那对未来充满信心的天性又恢复了。</p>
<p>‘Well，if he doesn't marry her before，he'll marry her after．If she plays her cards right．’</p>
<p>“嗯，就算他早不娶她，他晚也会娶她。要是苔丝有点儿心计的话。”</p>
<p>‘If he knows about her d’Urberville blood，you mean？’</p>
<p>“你是说如果他知道了她的德伯家血统？”</p>
<p>‘No，stupid，if she shows him her pretty face．’</p>
<p>“不，傻瓜，如果她向他展示她的漂亮脸蛋儿。”</p>
<p>Meanwhile Alec d’Urberville was whipping his horse and driving the carriage faster and faster downhill．The trees rushed past at great speed．Tess was feeling thoroughly frightened．He took no notice when she asked him to slow down．She cried out and held on to his arm in fear．</p>
<p>就在这时，亚历克&middot;德伯正鞭打着马，驾驭着他的马车以越来越快的速度下山。树木在飞快地倒退着。苔丝觉得自己简直要被吓蒙了。她请求他放慢速度，他根本不予理睬。苔丝尖叫着，恐惧中她抓住了他的手臂。</p>
<p>‘Don't touch my arm， hold on to my waist！’he shouted． At the top of another hill he said，laughing，‘Put your arms around me again， my beauty！’</p>
<p>“别碰我的手臂，抱着我的腰！”他叫道。又到了另一座山头，他笑着说道：“伸出你的手抱着我吧，我的美人儿！”</p>
<p>‘Never！’said Tess independently．</p>
<p>“决不！”苔丝的语气表明她不愿再求助于他。</p>
<p>‘Let me give you one little kiss， Tess， and I'll stop！’</p>
<p>“苔丝，让我轻轻地吻你一下，我就停下来！”</p>
<p>‘Will nothing else do？’cried Tess in despair．‘Oh， very well！’</p>
<p>“非这样做不可吗？”苔丝绝望地哭了。“哦，那好吧！”</p>
<p>As they raced on，he was on the point of kissing her，when she suddenly moved aside，so that he almost fell off．</p>
<p>马车还在急驶着。当他正准备吻她时，苔丝突然躲开了，以至于他几乎摔了下来。</p>
<p>‘I'll break both our necks！’he swore passionately．</p>
<p>“我会让我们俩的脖子一起摔断的！”他暴躁地咒骂道。</p>
<p>‘I thought you would be kind to me，’said Tess，her eyes filling with tears．‘I don't want to kiss anybody！’</p>
<p>“我原以为你不会欺侮我的。”苔丝说，她的眼眶盈满了泪水。“我不想亲任何人！”</p>
<p>But he insisted，so in the end she sat still and d’Urberville kissed her．No sooner had he done so than she wiped the place on her cheek with her handkerchief．Just then her hat blew off into the road and d’Urberville stopped the horse．Tess jumped down to get it，then turned triumphantly to Alec．</p>
<p>但是他坚持要这样。因此，最后她只好坐着不动，让德伯吻了她一下，但她立即就用手帕擦拭脸上被吻过的地方。就在这时，她的帽子被风吹到了地上。德伯停住了车，苔丝跳下车捡起了帽子，然后带着胜利的神情转向亚历克。</p>
<p>‘I shall walk from here，’she said firmly．</p>
<p>“我从这儿走着去。”苔丝说得很坚决。</p>
<p>‘But it's five or six miles more．’</p>
<p>“但还有五六英里路呢！”</p>
<p>‘I don't care．’</p>
<p>“我不在乎。”</p>
<p>‘You made that hat blow off on purpose！You did，didn't you？’</p>
<p>“你是故意让帽子被风吹掉的！肯定是这样的，对吗？”</p>
<p>She was silent．He swore angrily at her．</p>
<p>她没做声，他怒气冲冲地对她破口大骂开了。</p>
<p>‘Don't use such bad words！’cried Tess．‘I shall go back to mother！I hate you！’</p>
<p>“请不要说这么脏的话！”苔丝叫道，“我要回到妈妈那儿去，我恨你！”</p>
<p>D’Urberville suddenly started laughing．</p>
<p>德伯突然间大笑起来。</p>
<p>‘Look，I promise never to do that again，’he said．‘Come，let me take you in the carriage．’</p>
<p>“好了，我保证再也不这样了。”他说，“上来吧，让我用车载你去。”</p>
<p>But she refused， and began to walk in the direction of Trantridge．So they progressed slowly，d’Urberville driving the carriage beside Tess．</p>
<p>但她拒绝了，并朝纯瑞脊方向走去。因此，德伯只好驾着车跟在她身旁。两个人就这样缓缓前行着。</p><a href='5.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
