<p><b>2 巴斯克维尔家族的手稿 </b></p>
<p>'These papers were given to me by Sir Charles Baskerville，'said Dr Mortimer．'He asked me to take good care of them．You may remember that Sir Charles died suddenly three months ago．His death caused much excite－ ment in Devonshire，the county where Baskerville Hall is．Sir Charles was a sensible man，but he believed the story which is told in these papers．'</p>
<p>“这些手稿是查尔斯&middot;巴斯克维尔爵士托付给我的，”摩梯末医生道。“他要我保管好这些手稿。您可能还记得，查尔斯爵士于三个月前突然逝去。他的去世在德文郡引起了很大的关注，德文郡就是巴斯克维尔庄园的所在地。查尔斯爵士是位明智人士，但是他相信这些手稿中所讲述的故事。”</p>
<p>Dr Mortimer went on：'The story is about the Baskerville family．I have come to see you because I need your help．I think that something terrible is going to happen in the next twenty－ four hours．But you can't help me unless you know the story in these papers．May I read them to you？'</p>
<p>摩梯末医生继续讲道：“这个故事与巴斯克维尔家族有关。因为我需要您的帮助，所以我便来见您。我认为在即将到来的24小时之内将会发生一桩可怕的事情。但是，如果您不了解手稿中所讲述的故事的话，那么您就不可能帮得了我。我可以将它读给您听吗？”</p>
<p>'Please continue，Dr Mortimer，'said Holmes，and sat back in his chair with his eyes shut．</p>
<p>“请讲下去吧，摩梯末医生，”福尔摩斯说道，他还闭着眼睛向后坐了坐。</p>
<p>Mortimer began to read in his high，rather strange，voice：</p>
<p>摩梯末开始以他那高亢、奇特的嗓音读道：</p>
<p>I，William Baskerville，write this for my sons in the year 1742．My father told me about the Hound of the Baskervilles．He told me when it was first seen，and I be- lieve his story was true．I want you，my sons，to read this story carefully．I want you to know that God punishes those who do evil．But never forget that He will forgive those who are sorry for any evil they have done．</p>
<p>本人，威廉&middot;巴斯克维尔，于1742年为后代写下了这些。我的父亲告诉了我有关巴斯克维尔猎犬的事情。他告诉了我它第一次被人看见的经过，我认为他讲的故事是真实的。我希望你们，我的孩子们，认真看一看这个故事。我想让你们知道：上帝一贯惩罚那些为非作歹的人们。但是，永远不要忘记：上帝将宽恕那些悔过的人们。</p>
<p>Over a hundred years ago，in 1640，the head of the Baskerville family was Sir Hugo Baskerville．He was a wild and evil man．He was cruel and enjoyed hurting peo－ ple．Sir Hugo fell in love with the daughter of a farmer who was a neighbour of his．The young woman was afraid of the evil Hugo，and avoided him．One day，Hugo heard that her father and brothers were away．He knew that she would be alone．So he rode to the farm with five or six of his evil friends．They made the girl go back to Baskerville Hall with them，and locked her in a room upstairs．Then they sat down in the great dining hall to drink．As usual，they drank bottle after bottle and soon they began to sing and laugh and shout evil words．</p>
<p>一百多年前，在1640年，巴斯克维尔家族的头面人物是雨果&middot;巴斯克维尔爵士。他既放荡又邪恶。他残忍，以伤害别人为乐。雨果爵士爱上了与他毗邻的一位农夫的女儿。这位少女害怕这个邪恶的人，而且还躲着他。一天，雨果听说她的父兄几人都出门去了。他知道她将独自一人在家了。因此，他与五六个下流的狐朋狗友策马去了这个农常他们把她弄回了巴斯克维尔庄园，还把她关在楼上的一个房间里。然后他们便在楼下的大饭厅里坐下痛饮了起来。同往常一样，他们饮了一瓶又一瓶的酒，不久便开始狂歌乱笑并吐起脏话来。</p>
<p>The girl upstairs，who was already very frightened，felt desperate when she heard the terrible things they were shouting．So she did a very brave thing．She opened the window，climbed out of the room and down the ivy on the wall．Then she started to run across the moor towards her home．</p>
<p>楼上的这位姑娘，这时已是惊恐万分了，听到他们所讲的那些不堪入耳的脏话时便感到十分绝望。因此，在此情形之下她竟干出一件勇敢的事来。她打开窗户，从房间里爬出来，顺着墙上的常春藤一直爬了下来。然后她就穿过沼地径直往家中跑去了。</p>
<p>A little while later，Hugo left his friends and went up- stairs to the room to take her some food and drink．When he found an open window and an empty room，he behaved like a man who was mad．He ran down the stairs．He screamed that he would give himself to the Devil if he caught the girl before she reached home．Some of Hugo's drunken friends told him to let the hounds chase her，and so he ran from the house and unlocked the dogs．Then he jumped onto his black horse，and rode off over the moor with the hounds running and crying around him．</p>
<p>过了不多一会儿，雨果离开了他的那帮朋友，到楼上的那个房间给她送食物和酒去了。当他发现窗户大开、室内空空时，他就像中了魔一般。他冲下楼，大叫大嚷着说，只要他能在这个女孩赶回家之前追上她，他就愿把自己献给魔王任其摆布。雨果的那些已经喝得酩酊大醉的朋友们让他把猎狗放出去追她，因此他就从屋里跑出去把狗放了出来。接着，他跳在了那匹黑马的背上，由那群狂奔乱吼的狗簇拥着在沼地上策马而去。</p>
<p>Hugo's friends fetched their horses and followed him．There were thirteen of them．After a mile or two they passed an old farmer and asked him if he had seen Sir Hugo and the hounds．The man looked half mad with fear and spoke with difficulty．He said that he had seen the girl and the hounds running close behind her．Sir Hugo had been riding just behind the hounds．'But I have seen more than that，'the old man said．'Behind Sir Hugo I saw a huge and terrible hound running silently．May God keep me safe from that hound of hell．'</p>
<p>雨果的朋友们找到了自己的马匹，跟着他追去了。他们一共是13个人。在他们跑了一两英里路之后，遇到了一位老农夫，便问他看到了雨果爵士与他的那群猎狗没有。这个人看上去被吓得有些发疯，几乎都说不出话来。他说他曾看到过那位少女以及一群紧追她不放的猎犬。雨果爵士就骑着马跟在这些猎犬后面。“但是我看到的还不止这些，”这位老人说道。“我看到一条硕大而可怕的猎犬正一声不吭地跟在他的后面。但愿上帝别让这条地狱之犬伤害我！”</p>
<p>The thirteen men laughed at the old man and rode on．But their laughter soon stopped when they saw Sir Hugo's horse running wildly towards them without a rider．</p>
<p>这13个人对这位老人嘲笑了一番，接着又策马前往。但是当他们不久看到雨果爵士的那匹马身上无人并独自朝他们狂奔而来时就笑不出声来了。</p>
<p>The thirteen men moved closer together as they rode on．They were suddenly afraid．Over the moor they went until，at last，they caught up with the hounds．</p>
<p>这13个人向前骑着马，同时一致向紧靠了靠。他们突然间感到很害怕。他们在这片沼地上一直朝前骑着，直到最终赶上了那群猎狗。</p>
<p>Everyone in the county knew that the Baskerville hounds were brave and strong．But now they were stand- ing at the head of a deep valley in the moor with their ears and tails down．They were very frightened．Hugo's friends stopped．Most of them would not go on，but three were brave enough to go down into the valley．</p>
<p>巴斯克维尔家的猎犬骁勇而又强壮，在郡里是家喻户晓的。但它们这时却耷拉着双耳和尾巴站在沼地里的一条深谷的尽头。它们十分惊恐。雨果的这帮朋友们停了下来。他们大多数人都不愿意再往前骑了，但有三人胆大到朝山谷里走了过去的地步。</p>
<p>The valley had a wide flat floor．In the middle of the flat ground stood two great stones．They had stood there for thousands of years．The moon was shining brightly on the great stones，and between them，on the flat ground，lay the girl．She had fallen there，dead of fear and exhaus- tion．Sir Hugo's body was lying near her．But it was not the sight of Sir Hugo or the girl that filled the men with fear．It was the sight of the huge animal that was standing over Sir Hugo．Its teeth were at his throat．It was a great black creature that looked like a hound．But it was larger than any hound they had ever seen．</p>
<p>这个山谷的底部是一片宽阔的平地。在平地的中央立着两根大石柱。它们已经在那儿竖立了几千年之久。月光明朗地照在这两根大石柱上，而那位少女就躺在它们之间的平地上。她已因惊恐和疲惫倒地而死。雨果爵士的尸体躺在她旁边。但是，使这些人毛骨悚然的不是那位少女或雨果爵士的那幅景象，而是站在雨果爵士身旁的一只形体硕大的畜生。它的牙齿撕扯着他的喉咙。它是一个样子像猎狗的又大又黑的畜生。可是他们谁也没见过这么大的猎犬。</p>
<p>As they watched，it tore out Hugo Baskerville's throat．Then it turned towards them．Its eyes were burning brightly．Its body shone with a strange light．Blood ran from its mouth．The men screamed and kicked their horses．They rode back up the valley as fast as they could go．Later that night one died from the horror he had seen．The other two were mad for the rest of their lives．</p>
<p>在他们注视的时侯，它撕扯断了雨果&middot;巴斯克维尔的喉咙。然后，它转过身来面朝着他们。它的眼睛冒着火。身体也闪烁着一种奇特的光芒。鲜血从它的嘴里淌了出来。这几个人大叫起来并且踢起马来。他们调转马头以最快的速度跑出了山谷。在这之后，其中的一个人就在当天夜里因自己所看到的恐怖景象而吓死了，另外两个则终身精神失常。</p>
<p>That was the first time the Hound appeared，my sons．It has been seen many times since then，and many of the Baskervilles have died in strange and terrible ways．Be- cause of this I warn you not to cross the moors at night．The Devil finds it easy to do his work when the world is dark．</p>
<p>那就是那只猎犬初次露面的经过，我的孩子们。从那以后，人们曾多次目睹过它的踪迹，而且巴斯克维尔家族里有许多人都以蹊跷和恐怖的方式死去。因此，我警告你们不要在黑夜里走过沼地。魔鬼发现黑夜时正易于它嚣张一番。</p><a href='3.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
