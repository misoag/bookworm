<p><b>7 巴斯克维尔庄园 </b></p>
<p>Holmes came to Waterloo Station to say goodbye to us．Our friends told him that they were sure nobody had followed them since our last meeting．Sir Henry's other shoe had not reappeared．Holmes repeated his warning that Sir Hen－ ry should not go on the moor at night，and should not go any- where alone．Then Holmes checked with me that I had my gun，an army revolver．</p>
<p>福尔摩斯来滑铁卢车站向我们道别。我们的朋友们告诉他，他们敢肯定，自从上次见面以来就再也没有人跟踪过他们了。亨利爵士的另一只鞋没有再冒出来过。福尔摩斯再次警告亨利爵士不要在夜间到沼地上去，也不要单独去什么地方。接着，福尔摩斯又和我查看了一下我随身带的那把左轮手枪。</p>
<p>The journey was fast and enjoyable．We were met at New－ town Station and driven to Baskerville Hall．The countryside we drove through was beautiful，but behind it we could see the long，dark，frightening hills of the moor．</p>
<p>旅行迅速而又愉快。有人在纽敦车站迎接我们，并用车把我们送到了巴斯克维尔庄园。我们驱车经过的乡间景色很美，可是我们能看得到远处的沼地上的那些绵长、黝黑和令人惊恐的沼地山丘。</p>
<p>As we turned a corner，we were surprised to see a soldier on horseback．He was carrying a gun．</p>
<p>在拐弯处，我们惊奇地看到一个骑在马上的士兵。他拿着一杆枪。</p>
<p>Dr Mortimer asked our driver why the soldier was there．</p>
<p>摩梯末医生向车夫询问了那个士兵在那里的缘由。</p>
<p>'A dangerous criminal has escaped from the prison，sir，'he told us．'He's been free for three days now，and people are frightened．His name is Selden．He's the man who did that murder in London．'</p>
<p>“一个危险的罪犯越狱逃跑了，先生。”他告诉我们，“他已经逃出来三天了。他叫塞尔登。就是在伦敦杀人的那个家伙。”</p>
<p>I remembered the case well．It had been a very cruel murder．I thought of this killer out on the empty，wild moor，and I felt more and more uncomfortable about my surroundings．The beautiful green fields with their thick hedges were behind us，and we were now on the cold，open moor．Everything was grey，hard and wild Huge rough stones stood on the hard ground．The tops of the hills stood sharply like cruel teeth against the sky．A cold wind was blowing，and night was falling．I saw Sir Henry pull his coat closer round him．</p>
<p>那个案子我记得很清楚。杀人手段非常残忍。我想到了在这片空旷、荒芜的沼地上活动着的这个凶手，愈来愈觉得周围的环境叫人不安。那些长着茂密的树篱的、美丽的、绿色的田野已经被奔驰的马车甩在我们身后了，我们现在到了既寒冷又空旷的沼地上。这里的一切都灰蒙蒙、硬梆梆的，又很荒芜。坚硬的地面上竖立着粗糙的巨石。山顶很尖，在天空的衬托下好像一排排獠牙。正刮着冷飕飕的风，夜幕正在降临。我看到亨利爵士把大衣裹得更紧了些。</p>
<p>At last we reached the gates of Baskerville Hall．From the gates a long，dark road led up to the house，with the black shapes of old trees on each side of it．At the end of this road we could see the great house standing with a pale light round it like a ghost．</p>
<p>我们终于到了巴斯克维尔庄园的门口。大门那儿有一条漫长而又阴暗的路径通向房屋，道路的两旁是一些老树的暗影。我们在道路的尽头处看到一所像幽灵似地闪着微光的房屋。</p>
<p>'I can understand why my uncle felt that trouble was com－ ing to him here．It's not a welcoming place，'said Sir Henry，and his voice shook as he spoke．</p>
<p>“我能理解伯父为何在这儿时总是觉得要大难临头了。这并非一个友好的地方。”亨利爵士说道，讲话时声音都在颤抖着。</p>
<p>As we got closer，we could see that the Hall was a heavy，dark building with a large main entrance．Most of the building was old and was covered in dark green ivy，but some of it had been built more recently and was of grim，black stone．A dull light shone through the heavy windows．Black smoke was com－ ing from one of the high chimneys of the main building．</p>
<p>我们走近时，看到这是一栋结实而又幽暗、主入口处很大的建筑。建筑物的大部分都很古老了，墙壁上爬满了深绿色的常春藤；可是某些部分却是最近刚砌成的，材料是一些阴森的黑色石块。阴暗的光线从结实的窗口透出来。黑烟从主楼的一个高高的烟囱里喷了出来。</p>
<p>'Welcome，Sir Henry！Welcome to Baskerville Hall．'</p>
<p>“欢迎欢迎，亨利爵爷！欢迎您到巴斯克维尔庄园来！”</p>
<p>Barrymore，the butler，and his wife were waiting on the steps at the main entrance They came down and took our suit－ cases into the house Dr Mortimer left us to go home，and we went into the hall，where a fire was burning．It was a fine room，large and high．</p>
<p>总管白瑞摩和妻子正在主入口处的台阶上恭候着我们。他们走下来，把我们的行李箱提到了屋里。摩梯末医生离开我们回家去了。我们便进了大厅，那儿炉火正熊熊燃烧着。那是个华美的房间，又大又高。</p>
<p>'It's exactly as I imagined an old family home，'Sir Henry said．</p>
<p>“这正是我想像中的一个古老的家族的宅邸，”亨利爵士说道。</p>
<p>Barrymore showed us to our rooms He was a tall，handsome man，with a full black beard．After we had washed and changed our clothes，he brought us to dinner．The dining-room was not very welcoming．It needed more lights to make it brighter．On the walls were the pictures of the Baskervilles of the past．They looked down on us silently，and did nothing to make us feel happier．</p>
<p>白瑞摩把我们带到了各自的房间。他是个高大、英俊的男子，留着满腮的黑胡子。在我们洗漱之后，他带我们去进餐。饭厅不太招人喜欢。需要再点些蜡烛把它照亮些。墙上是巴斯克维尔家族的先辈们的画像。它们消无声息地俯视着我们，丝毫没让我们感觉快活一些。</p>
<p>After dinner we went to our rooms．Before I got into bed，I looked out of my window A strong wind sang sadly as it bent the trees in front of the Hall．A half moon shone through the dark，flying clouds onto the wild and empty moor．</p>
<p>晚饭过后我们便各自回房去了。我在上床之前向窗外眺望了一番。强风在外面悲鸣，同时还使庄园前面的树木摇晃着。半轮月亮透过阴暗的、飞奔的云朵照到了荒凉、空旷的沼地上。</p>
<p>I could not sleep．Then，suddenly，in the middle of the night I heard very clearly the sound of a woman crying．It was the crying of a person who was hurt by some deep sadness．The sound was not far away，and was certainly in the house．</p>
<p>我无法入睡。后来，突然之间，我在深夜里清楚地听到了一个女人的哭泣声。那哭声是一个陷入深深的悲伤之中的人发出的。声音就在不远处，可以肯定就在这栋房子里。</p><a href='8.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
