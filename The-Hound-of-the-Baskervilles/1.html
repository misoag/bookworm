<p><b>1 这宗案件开始了 </b></p>
<p>The September sun was shining brightly into the win－dows of 221B Baker Street，and London was enjoying a beautiful late summer．I had finished my breakfast and was reading the newspaper．As usual，Holmes had got up late，and was still eating．We were expecting a visitor at half past ten，and I wondered whether Holmes would finish his breakfast be－ fore our visitor arrived．</p>
<p>9月的阳光明媚地照进了贝克街221号B门的窗户里，整个伦敦都在享受晚夏的美好时光。我已吃过早餐，此时正在看报纸。福尔摩斯同往常一样，总是很晚才起床。他这时正在进餐。我们正等待着一位预约好要在10点半时前来拜访的客人；我不知道福尔摩斯在客人到来之前是否吃得完他的早餐。</p>
<p>Holmes was in no hurry．He was reading once again a letter he had received three days ago．It was from Dr James Mortimer，who asked for an appointment with Holmes．</p>
<p>福尔摩斯并不匆忙行事。他又看了一遍三天之前收到的那封来信。这是詹姆斯&middot;摩梯末医生写来的。他请求能够约个时间和福尔摩斯见次面。</p>
<p>'Well，Watson，'Holmes said to me，'I'm afraid that a doc－ tor from Devonshire won't bring us anything of real interest．His letter doesn't tell us anything about his business though he says it's very important．I hope we can help him．'</p>
<p>“啊，华生，”福尔摩斯对我讲道，“恐怕德文郡的这位医生是不会给我们带来任何有趣的事情的。虽然他说事情举足轻重，但是他的信中并未说明他的来意。我希望我们能够帮他的忙。”</p>
<p>At exactly half past ten there was a knock on our front door．</p>
<p>正好10点半时，有人敲了敲我们的前门。</p>
<p>'Good，'said Holmes．'Dr Mortimer is clearly a man who will not waste our time．'</p>
<p>“嘿，”福尔摩斯道，“摩梯末医生显然并非一位即将浪费我们时间的人。”</p>
<p>We stood up as our visitor was brought into the room．</p>
<p>当客人被带进屋时，我们起身迎接了他。</p>
<p>'Good morning，gentlemen，'he said．'I'm Dr James Mor－ timer，from Grimpen in Devonshire，and I think you must be Mr Sherlock Holmes．'He shook hands with Holmes，who said：</p>
<p>“早上好，先生们。”他讲道，“我是詹姆斯，摩梯末医生，是从德文郡的格林盆来的；我想您一定就是歇洛克&middot;福尔摩斯先生了。”他与福尔摩斯握了握手，福尔摩斯道：</p>
<p>'How do you do，Dr Mortimer？May I introduce my good friend，Dr John Watson，who helps me with my cases．I hope you will allow him to listen to our conversation．'</p>
<p>“您好吗，摩梯末医生？我来介绍一下我的好朋友约翰&middot;华生医生，他一直在帮我办案。我希望您能允许他来听我们的谈话。”</p>
<p>'Of course，'said Mortimer，as he turned to me and shook hands．'I need your help very badly，Mr Holmes．If it will be useful for Dr Watson to hear what I have to say，please let him stay and listen．'</p>
<p>“当然可以，”摩梯末边说着话边回头与我握手。“我急需您的帮助，福尔摩斯先生。如我的话对华生医生有用的话，那就请他留下来听吧！”</p>
<p>Mortimer did not look like a country doctor．He was very tall and thin．He had a long thin nose．His grey eyes were bright，and he wore gold glasses．His coat and trousers were old and worn．His face was young，but his shoulders were bent like an old man's and his head was pushed forward．He took some pa－ pers from his pocket，and said：</p>
<p>摩梯末看上去并不像是一位乡间医生。他身材高大，身体瘦削，长着细长的鼻子。他那灰色的眼睛炯炯有神，他还戴着一副金丝眼镜。他的外衣和裤子都已破旧、磨损不堪了。他的脸看上去还很年轻，但是已像老人一样佝偻，而且头还向前探着。他从口袋里取出一些手稿，并说道：</p>
<p>'Mr Holmes，I need your help and advice．Something very strange and frightening has been happening．'</p>
<p>“福尔摩斯先生，我需要您的帮助和建议。发生了一件既奇怪又恐怖的事情。”</p>
<p>'Sit down，Dr Mortimer，'said Holmes，'and tell us your problem．I'll help you if I can．'</p>
<p>“坐下，摩梯末医生，”福尔摩斯道，“并告诉我您的疑难问题。我将尽力帮助您。”</p><a href='2.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
