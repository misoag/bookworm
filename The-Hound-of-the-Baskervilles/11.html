<p><b>11 劳拉&middot;莱昂丝 </b></p>
<p>Ιtold Sir Henry about Laura Lyons，and that I wanted to speak to her as soon as possible．Then I went to her house in Newtown．</p>
<p>我告诉了亨利爵士关于劳拉&middot;莱昂丝的事情，还说我想尽快与她谈一谈。此后我便到纽顿去了她家。</p>
<p>A maid took me into the sitting room，where a very pretty lady with dark hair was working at a typewriter．I told her who I was，and that I had met her father．</p>
<p>一位女仆将我带进了起居室，一位非常漂亮的黑发女士正坐在打字机前工作。我告诉了她我是谁，还说我曾见过她父亲。</p>
<p>'I have no contact with my father，'she said．' He gave me no help when I was in trouble．Sir Charles Baskerville and some other kind people helped me when I was poor and hungry．'</p>
<p>“我与我父亲之间没什么联系，”她讲道。“在我身处困境时他没有给我丝毫的帮助。查尔斯&middot;巴斯克维尔爵士与别的一些好心肠的人们在我又穷又饿时曾经帮助过我。”</p>
<p>'It is about Sir Charles that I have come to see you，'I said．'I want to know if you ever wrote to him and asked him to meet you．'</p>
<p>“我就是因为查尔斯爵士的事情才来见您的，”我说道。“我想知道您是否曾经给他写信并请求他来见您一面。”</p>
<p>She looked very，angry，and her face went white．</p>
<p>她看上去十分愤怒，她的面孔还变得苍白。</p>
<p>'What a question！'she said．'What right have you to ask me about my private life？But the answer is “no”．'</p>
<p>“岂有此理的问题！”她说道。“您有何权利向我询问有关我的私人生活的事情？但是我的回答是：'没有'。”</p>
<p>'Surely you are not remembering clearly，'I said．'I think you wrote to him on the day that he died．And your letter said： “Please，please，burn this letter，and be at the gate by ten o'clock．”'</p>
<p>“您肯定没记清楚，”我说道。“我认为您在他临终的那天曾给他写过信。您的信中还是这么写的：'请您千万将此信烧掉，并在10点钟的时候到栅门那里去。'”</p>
<p>For a moment I thought she was going to faint．Then she said in a low oice：'I asked Sir Charles to tell nobdy．'</p>
<p>我一度以为她就要晕厥了。接着，她低声说道：“我曾请求查尔斯爵士不要告诉任何人的。”</p>
<p>'You must not think that Sir Charles spoke to anyone about you，'I said．' He put the letter on the fire，but not all of it was burnt．Now，did you write that letter to him？'</p>
<p>“您不该认为查尔斯爵士曾同任何人谈起您，”我说道。“他把这封信投在火中了，但并没全烧掉。我说，您曾给他写过那封信吗？”</p>
<p>'Yes，'she said．'Why should I be ashamed of writing to him？I wanted him to help me．I learned that he was going to London early on the following day，so I asked him to meet me before he went．I could not go to the Hall earlier that day．'</p>
<p>“是的，我写过，”她说道。“我为何要为曾写信给他而感到羞愧呢？我本想让他帮助我。我听说他第二天一大早就要到伦敦去。那天我又不能早一点到庄园去。”</p>
<p>'But why did you ask him to meet you in the garden instead of in the house？'I asked．</p>
<p>“但是您为何要求他在花园里而不是在屋里与您会面呢？”我问道。</p>
<p>'Do you think it would be sensible for a woman to go at that time of night into the house of an unmarried man？'she asked．</p>
<p>“您想，一个女人在夜间的那个时候到一个单身汉的家里明智吗？”她问道。</p>
<p>'Well，what happened when you got there？'I asked．</p>
<p>“噢，您到那里去时发生了什么事情？”我问道。</p>
<p>'I didn't go，'she replied．</p>
<p>“我并没有去，”她应答道。</p>
<p>'Mrs Lyons！'</p>
<p>“莱昂丝太太！”</p>
<p>'I tell you I did not go．Something happened that stopped me from going．I can't tell you what it was．'</p>
<p>“我告诉您我并没有去。发生了一件事使我去不成了。我不能告给您这是件什么事。”</p>
<p>'Mrs Lyons，' I said．' If you did not see Sir Charles，you must tell me why．If you do not，it will look very bad for you if I have to go to the police with this new piece of information about the letter．'</p>
<p>“莱昂丝太太，”我讲道，“如果您并没见到查尔斯爵士的话，您一定要告诉我其中的缘由。要是您不肯说出来的话，要是我带着有关这封信件的新线索去警察局了，形势将对您非常不利。”</p>
<p>Mrs Lyons thought for a moment，and then she said：' I see that I must tell you．Perhaps you know that I married a man who was very cruel to me．I hate him and I wanted to get a di-vorce．But a divorce is expensive，and I had no money．I thought that if Sir Charles heard my sad story，he would help me to get a divorce．'</p>
<p>莱昂丝太太斟酌了片刻，接着说道：“我看来得告诉您了。您也许知道我嫁给了一个对我非常残酷的男子。我恨他，我曾想与他离婚。可是离婚是桩昂贵的事情，而我又没有什么钱。我当时觉得，要是查尔斯爵士听到了我那悲惨的故事的话，他就会帮助我离婚。”</p>
<p>'Then why didn't you go to see Sir Charles？'I asked her．</p>
<p>“那么您为什么又没有去见查尔斯爵士呢？”我向她问道。</p>
<p>'Because I got help from someone else，'she said．</p>
<p>“因为我从别人那儿已得到帮助了，”她说道。</p>
<p>'Why didn't you write to Sir Charles and tell him？'</p>
<p>“为什么您没有写信给查尔斯爵士并告诉他呢？”</p>
<p>' I was going to，but I saw in the newspaper the next morn- ing that he had died．'</p>
<p>“我是打算这么做的，但在第二天早上我在报纸上看到了他已死的消息。”</p>
<p>I asked Mrs Lyons a number of other questions，but she did not change her story，whatever I asked her．I was sure that she was telling the truth．I could check two important parts of the story．If they were right，there could be no doubt that she was telling the truth．I could check that she had begun to get her divorce at about the time of Sir Charles' death．I could also check that she had not been to Baskerville Hall on the night of Sir Charles' death．</p>
<p>我问了莱昂丝太太许多别的问题，但是她不管我怎么问都不肯改口。我敢保证她讲了实话。我可以验证一下她的叙述中关键的两点。如果这两处正确无误，那么无疑她是在讲真话。我可以调查一下，看看她在查尔斯爵士逝去之时是否真的开始为离婚而忙乎着。我还可以调查一下，看看她是否在查尔斯爵士逝去的当晚真的没去巴斯克维尔庄园。</p>
<p>But I was not sure that she had told me the whole truth．Why had she nearly fainted when I had told her about the let- ter？ That was not completely explained by the story she had told me．</p>
<p>但是我不敢肯定她是否已告诉了我全部实情。当我告诉她关于这封信的事情时她为何几乎要晕了过去呢？这点由她告诉我的故事不能完全解释得通。</p>
<p>I had discovered all I could for the moment．I left her，and went to search for more information in a different place．</p>
<p>目前我已竭尽全力去发现探索了。我离开了她，到一个与之有别的地方搜寻更多的信息去了。</p><a href='12.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
