<p>The police arrived very quickly．There were a lot of them．Some of them with cameras went upstairs to Molly's room．Two detectives talked to Dr Pratt in the kitchen．The family waited in the sitting room．It was a hot day again and the windows were open．The dogs sat quietly at Diane's feet．Nobody talked．Jackie smoked．They waited for a long time．Suddenly the door opened and the two detectives came in．</p>
<p>警察很快就到了，来了许多人，一些人带着相机上楼到莫利的房间。两个侦探在厨房和普拉特医生谈话。家人在客厅等着。这又是个热天，窗户开着，狗安静地坐在黛安娜脚旁。没人说话。杰基抽着烟。他们等了很长时间。突然门开了，两名侦探走了进来。</p>
<p>'Good morning．I am Detective Inspector Walsh and this is Sergeant Foster．'The Inspector did not smile．He was a big man in an old black suit and a black hat and coat．</p>
<p>“早上好。我是沃尔什探长，这是福斯特警官。”探长没有笑。他是个高大的男人，穿件黑色的旧衣服，披着件黑色外套，戴着顶黑色的帽子。</p>
<p>He wore a coat because he always felt cold．'Last night someone put sleeping tablets in Mrs Clarkson's hot milk．We are going to question everybody，and we need a room，please．'</p>
<p>他总觉得冷所以穿了件外套。“昨晚有人把安眠药放在克拉克森太太的热牛奶里，我们会问每个人。劳驾，我们需要一个房间。”</p>
<p>Roger stood up．'I'm Roger Clarkson．You can have my father's old office．Come with me，it's along here，'</p>
<p>罗杰站起来。“我是罗杰&middot;克拉克森。你们可以用我父亲过去的办公室。跟我来，就在这儿。”</p>
<p>The office was not a very big room，but there was a table and three or four chairs．Roger opened the window．</p>
<p>办公室不是很大，但有一张桌子和三四把椅子。罗杰打开了窗户。</p>
<p>'I would like to talk first to your uncle，Albert King，'In-spector Walsh said．He took off his hat and coat and sat down behind the table．</p>
<p>“我想先和你的姨父艾伯特&middot;金谈谈，”沃尔什探长说。他脱下帽子和外套，坐在桌旁。</p>
<p>'Of course，'said Roger and left the room．</p>
<p>“当然可以，”罗杰说，然后离开了。</p>
<p>Sergeant Foster waited by the door．He was a very tall young man with black hair and a nice smile．He was not very happy this morning because he usually played tennis on Sunday mornings．He was one of the best players at the Cambridge Tennis Club．</p>
<p>福斯特警官等在门边。他是个高个子、黑头发，有着迷人微笑的年青人。他通常在周日早上打网球，因而今早他有些不高兴。他是剑桥网球俱乐部最好的队员之一。</p>
<p>Albert came in and sat down．</p>
<p>艾伯特走进来坐下。</p>
<p>'I'm going to ask some questions，Mr King，'the Inspector said，'and Sergeant Foster is going to write it all down．'</p>
<p>“金先生，我想问你几个问题，”探长说，“然后福斯特警官会把你说的话都记录下来。”</p>
<p>Albert looked at his feet．'Yes，yes．It's your job．I know that．'</p>
<p>艾伯特看着自己的脚。“好，好的。这是你们的工作。我理解。”</p>
<p>'Tell me about last night，'Inspector Walsh asked quietly．'You were angry with Mrs Clarkson．'</p>
<p>“告诉我有关昨晚的事。”沃尔什探长平静地问。“你对克拉克森太太生气了。”</p>
<p>Albert looked at Inspector Walsh for the first time．'Yes，I was．Everyone was angry．Roger was angry．Diane wanted money to go to America．Then there's a man called Tom Brig-gs…He wants half the garden for his farm．Molly was a rich woman．I need money because my wife Annie—Molly's sister—is very ill．I told Molly this．'</p>
<p>艾伯特这才直视着沃尔什探长。“是的，我生气了。每个人都生气了，罗杰生气了，黛安娜想要钱去美国。然后有个叫汤姆&middot;布里格斯的男人……他想要一半花园当他的农常莫利是个富有的女人。我需要钱，因为我的妻子安妮——莫利的姐姐——病得很重。我把这些告诉了莫利。”</p>
<p>'What happened next？'</p>
<p>“接着发生了什么？”</p>
<p>'Well，Molly was angry with everyone and went upstairs．We went into the kitchen for coffee．Jackie wanted everyone to go up and say good night to Molly．She lives here with Molly so she wanted Molly to be happy．At first Roger said no．He was angry and didn't want to see his mother．'</p>
<p>“嗯，莫利冲大家生气，然后上了楼。我们进厨房去喝咖啡。杰基希望每人都上去对莫利道晚安。她和莫利住在一块，所以她想让莫利快乐些。开始罗杰不同意，他在生气，不想见他的妈妈。”</p>
<p>'And did you see Molly in her room？'</p>
<p>“接着你去莫利的房间见她了？”</p>
<p>'Yes．I was tired and I went upstairs first．I went to Molly's room and asked her for money again．But no—there was no money for her sister．'Albert stopped and put his hand over his eyes．</p>
<p>“是的。我累了，我先上了楼。我去莫利的房间又向她要钱。但是不行——她没有钱给她的姐姐。”艾伯特停下来并用手蒙住了眼睛。</p>
<p>Inspector Walsh watched Albert for a minute．'Did you hear noises after you went to bed？'</p>
<p>沃尔什探长看了会艾伯特。“你上床后听到什么声音吗？”</p>
<p>'Everyone went into Molly's room to say good night，I think．Later，I heard someone…He—or she—went down－stairs．That was about midnight．'</p>
<p>“我想，每人都到莫利的房间对他道晚安。随后，我听到有人……他——或则她——下了楼。那时大概是午夜了。”</p>
<p>'Very well，Mr King．Thank you，you can go now．'Albert left the room．</p>
<p>“很好，金先生，谢谢。你现在可以走了。”艾伯特离开了房间。</p>
<p>Inspector Walsh put his hands behind his head．'What time is it？I'm hungry．We're learning a lot，but I need some coffee．'</p>
<p>沃尔什探长把手放在脑后。“几点了？我饿了。我们了解了不少东西，但我需要点咖啡。”</p>
<p>'Shall I go to the kitchen？'Sergeant Foster asked．</p>
<p>“要我去厨房吗？”福斯特警官问。</p>
<p>'Oh，no．Later．Let's see Jackie Clarkson next．'</p>
<p>“哦，不，呆会儿。咱们接下来见见杰基&middot;克拉克森。”</p>
<p>Jackie came in and sat down．She looked down at her hands and said nothing．</p>
<p>杰基走进来坐下，她低头看着手没说话。</p>
<p>'We found the empty bottle of your mother's sleeping tablets in Diane's room，'the Inspector said suddenly．Then he waited．Jackie's face did not change and she said nothing．</p>
<p>“我们在黛安娜的房间发现了你妈妈安眠药的空瓶子。”探长突然说，然后他等着。杰基脸色没变，她一言不发。</p>
<p>'Tell me，did your mother get her tablets from the shop in the village？'</p>
<p>“告诉我，你的妈妈是从村里的商店买到药的吗？”</p>
<p>'Yes．My mother usually took a sleeping tablet every night so she needed a lot of tablets．Sometimes she got them from the shop，sometimes I did．On Thursday，I asked Peter Hobbs to get them．He lives in the house across the road，and he of－ten goes to the village on his bicycle．'</p>
<p>“对。妈妈通常每晚都要服一片安眠药，所以她要许多药片。有时她去商店买，有时是我去。周四我请彼特&middot;霍布斯去买。他住在马路对面的那幢房子，他经常骑自行车去村里。”</p>
<p>'I see．Your mother wanted to stay in this house．How about you？Did you want to move？'</p>
<p>“明白了。你母亲想留在这幢房子里。你呢？你想搬家吗？”</p>
<p>Jackie looked up for a minute and then down at her hands a－gain．'This is Mother's house．I loved my mother．She was good to me．'</p>
<p>杰基抬头看了会然后又低下头看着她的手。“这是我妈妈的房子。我爱我的妈妈，她对我很好。”</p>
<p>'Did you see your mother in her room last night？'</p>
<p>“昨晚你去她的房间见她了吗？”</p>
<p>'Yes，everyone did．Diane made hot milk and took it to Mother．She usually drank a cup of hot milk before she slept．'</p>
<p>“去了，每人都去了。黛安娜煮了热牛奶并端给了妈妈。她通常在睡前要喝杯热牛奶。”</p>
<p>Inspector Walsh put his hands behind his head．Jackie was very quiet．'What did your mother say？'</p>
<p>沃尔什探长把手放在脑后。杰基很平静。“你的妈妈说些什么？”</p>
<p>Jackie opened her bag and looked for a cigarette．'Can I smoke？'</p>
<p>杰基打开包找了枝烟。“我可以抽吗？”</p>
<p>'Of course．This is your house，'Inspector Walsh said．He watched Jackie．'What did your mother say？'he asked again．</p>
<p>“当然，这是你的家，”沃尔什探长说，他看着杰基。“你的妈妈说了些什么？”他又问。</p>
<p>'She wanted to go downstairs again．She remembered the dogs—she wanted to get some dinner for them． I went to my room and she went downstairs．'</p>
<p>“她又想下楼。她想起了狗——她想给它们弄点东西吃。我走回我的房间然后她下了楼。”</p>
<p>'What time was this？'</p>
<p>“这时几点了？”</p>
<p>'I don't remember．About midnight，I think．'</p>
<p>“我记不清了。我想大概是午夜。”</p>
<p>'And the cup of hot milk？'</p>
<p>“那么那杯热牛奶呢？”</p>
<p>'It was on the table by her bed．'</p>
<p>“它在她床边的桌上。”</p>
<p>'Did you need your mother's money？'</p>
<p>“你需要你母亲的钱吗？”</p>
<p>'No，Inspector．Money is not important to me．There are more important things，'Jackie said quietly．</p>
<p>“不，探长。钱对我不重要。有比钱更重要的东西，”杰基平静地说。</p>
<p>'Well，your uncle Albert wanted money．Tom Briggs wanted the garden．You wanted nothing？'</p>
<p>“嗯，你的艾伯特姨父要钱，汤姆&middot;布里格斯想要花园。你什么也不想要？”</p>
<p>Jackie finished her cigarette and looked up at the Inspector．Her eyes were suddenly angry．'Don't forget Peter Hobbs．He lost his job because of my mother．He wanted to kill her，you know．And what about Diane？You found the empty bottle in her bag．'</p>
<p>杰基抽完烟抬头看着探长。她的眼里突然冒着火气。“别忘了彼特&middot;霍布斯。是我妈妈使他丢了工作。你知道，他想杀她。还有黛安娜呢？你们在她包里发现了空瓶子。”</p>
<p>Inspector Walsh listened carefully．'We're going to question everyone，Miss Clarkson．'</p>
<p>沃尔什探长仔细听着。“我们会对每个人提问，克拉克森小姐。”</p>
<p>Jackie said nothing for a minute．'Would you like some sandwiches and coffee，Inspector？'</p>
<p>杰基沉默了一会。“探长，你们要些三明治和咖啡吗？”</p>
<p>'Ah！Yes，please！'Inspector Walsh said warmly．'I would like sandwiches and coffee very much．'</p>
<p>“哈！好，麻烦了！”沃尔什探长温和地说。“我非常想要三明治和咖啡。”</p>
<p>Jackie left the room．Inspector Walsh thought about her．Why was she suddenly angry？The room was quiet．</p>
<p>杰基离开了房间。沃尔什探长想，她为什么突然生气了？房间静悄悄的。</p><a href='5.html'>Next Chapter</a></body></html>
