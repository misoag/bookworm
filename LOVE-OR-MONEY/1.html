<p>The Clarkson family lived in the country near Cambridge，about half a mile from the nearest village and about a mile from the river．They had a big，old house with a beautiful garden，a lot of flowers and many old．trees．</p>
<p>克拉克森家住在剑桥附近的乡下，离最近的村庄约有半英里路，距离河有1英里左右。他们有幢大而古老带有美丽花园的房子，花园里有许多花和许多古树。</p>
<p>One Thursday morning in July，Jackie came in from the garden．She was a tall，fat woman，thirty years old．It was the hottest day of the year，but she wore a warm brown skirt and yellow shirt．She went into the kitchen to get a drink of water．Just then the phone rang．</p>
<p>7月的一个星期四早上，杰基从花园进了屋。她是个高大，肥胖，30来岁的女人。这是一年中最热的日子，而她却穿着暖色调的黄色衬衫和棕色裙子。她走进厨房去喝水，这时电话响了。</p>

<p>“你好！我是黛安娜。我想和妈妈说话。”</p>
<p>'Mother isn't here，'Jackie said．'She's at the doctor's．'</p>
<p>“妈妈不在家，”杰基说。“她看医生去了。”</p>
<p>'Why？What's Wrong？'</p>
<p>“怎么了？出了什么事？”</p>
<p>'Nothing's wrong，'Jackie said．'Why are you telephoning？ You are going to come this weekend？ Mother wants everyone to be here．'</p>
<p>“没什么，”杰基说。“你打电话干嘛？这个周末你回来吗？妈妈希望每个人都在。”</p>
<p>'Yes，I want to come，'Diane said．'I'm phoning because I have no money for the train ticket．'</p>
<p>“是啊，我想回来，”黛安娜说。“我正因为没钱买火车票，才打电话。”</p>

<p>Jackie put the phone down．She took a cigarette from her bag and began to smoke．She felt angry because her sister al-ways asked for money．Diane was twenty years old， the youngest in the family．She lived in London，in one room of a big house．She wanted to be a singer．She sang very well but she could never get work．</p>
<p>杰基放下电话，她从包里拿了枝烟抽起来。她因她的妹妹总是要钱感到生气。黛安娜20岁了，在家里最校她住在伦敦，在一所大房子里有间屋子。她想成为一个歌唱家，她唱得很棒可是她却从来不愿找工作。</p>

<p>Two big，black dogs came into the kitchen after her and ran across to her．She sat down and put her hands on their heads．</p>
<p>两条大黑狗跟着她进了厨房围着她转，她坐下来把手放在它们的头上。</p>
<p>Jackie put the sandwiches on the table．'Mother，'she said，'Diane phoned．She wants money for her train ticket．'</p>
<p>杰基把三明治放在桌上。“妈妈，”她说道，“黛安娜打来电话，她想要钱买火车票。”</p>
<p>Molly closed her eyes for a minute．Then she stood up．'This afternoon I want you to get the house ready for the weekend，'she said．'Oh，and please go to the village later and get my tablets．'</p>
<p>莫利闭上眼一会，然后站起来。“下午我希望你收拾一下房子为周末做准备，”她说。“哦，随后请去村里给我买些药片。”</p>
<p>'Yes，Mother，'Jackie said．</p>
