<p>On Monday morning Sergeant Foster went to Roger's office and asked some questions．And then he went to Albert's house and asked some more questions．Inspector Walsh sat in his office and telephoned．He made phone calls about Peter Hobbs and he made phone calls about Tom Briggs．And then he had some coffee and sandwiches．</p>
<p>星期一早上，福斯特警官去罗杰的办公室，问了几个问题，然后他去艾伯特家，问了些别的问题。沃尔什探长坐在办公室打电话。他打电话找彼特&middot;霍夫斯，然后又打电话找汤姆&middot;布里格斯。接着他要了些咖啡和三明治。</p>
<p>At three o'clock the two detectives drove to the Clarksons' house．</p>
<p>3点钟，两名侦探开车去了克拉克森家。</p>
<p>'I would like to see everyone，'he told Roger．</p>
<p>“我想见见每个人，”他告诉罗杰。</p>
<p>Everyone came into the sitting room and sat down．</p>
<p>大家都走进客厅坐下来。</p>
<p>Inspector Walsh stood in front of the windows and looked at them，one by one．'I want to talk to you Someone killed Molly Clarkson．Someone put sleeping tablets in her hot milk and killed her Nobody wanted to tell me the true story，but now I know the true story and I'm going to tell you．'</p>
<p>沃尔什探长站在窗前轮流地看了每个人一眼。“我想和你们谈谈。有人杀死了莫利&middot;克拉克森，有人把安眠药放在她的热牛奶里杀了她。没人愿意告诉我实情，但现在我知道了事情真象，我将会告诉你们。”</p>
<p>The two dogs came slowly into the room and sat down at Diane's feet．It was very quiet in the room．</p>
<p>两条狗慢慢走进房间坐在黛安娜脚旁。房间里非常安静。</p>
<p>The Inspector looked at Albert．'Mr King，your wife is very ill and needs a nurse．You told me this．You didn't tell me about your house．You're selling your house next month because you need the money．'</p>
<p>探长看着艾伯特。“金先生，你妻子病得很重需要一名护士，你告诉了我。你却没告诉我有关你的房子。因为你们需要钱，你们下个月就要卖了你们的房子。”</p>
<p>Albert was angry．'Last year I asked Molly's husband for some money，and he said yes．But then he died in an accident．'</p>
<p>艾伯特生气了。“去年我向莫利的丈夫要些钱，他答应了。可接着他死于一场事故。”</p>
<p>'Accident！'Diane cried．'That was no accident．Mother killed Daddy because she wanted his money！</p>
<p>“事故！”黛安娜叫道。“那不是事故！妈妈想要他的钱，所以她杀了爸爸！”</p>
<p>'Let's talk about you now，Diane，'said Inspector Walsh．You visited your mother every month and you took money from her．Last month she gave you money for your television．This month she gave you money for your telephone．Every month you told your mother：“It was no accident；you killed Daddy．I'm going to tell the police．”Your mother was afraid of the police and so she gave you the money．But in the end she wanted to stop you．She told Dr Pratt．No more money，she told Dr Pratt on Thursday；and on Saturday she died．You took the hot milk to your mother－what did she tell you？'</p>
<p>“咱们现在谈谈你，黛安娜，”沃尔什探长说。“你每个月都来见你母亲，然后从她那儿要走钱。上个月她给你钱买电视，这个月她又为你的电话付钱。每次你告诉你的母亲：'那不是一场事故；你杀了爸爸。我要告诉警察。'你母亲害怕警察，所以她给你钱。但是最后她想阻止你。她告诉了普拉特医生，没有太多的钱了，她是周四告诉普拉特医生的。接着星期天她死了。你端热牛奶给你母亲——她给你说些什么？”</p>
<p>Diane began to cry．'I loved Daddy！He always gave money to me；he loved me．It was Mother－she didn't love Daddy and she didn't love me．Diane stopped．The dogs got up and went to the door．'It's true，I took a lot of money from Mother．On Saturday she told me—no more money．I wanted to kill her，but I didn't．'</p>
<p>黛安娜开始哭。“我爱爸爸！他总是给我钱，他爱我。就是妈妈——她不爱爸爸，也不爱我。”黛安娜停住了。狗站起来向门口走去。“是真的，我从母亲那儿要了不少钱。我想杀了她，可我没有。”</p>
<p>The dogs came back and sat down again at Diane's feet．Inspector Walsh looked at Roger．'Mr Clarkson also needed money．'</p>
<p>狗回来又坐在黛安娜脚旁。沃尔什探长看着罗杰。“克拉克森先生也需要钱。”</p>
<p>Roger's face went red．'Don't tell them！Please！'</p>
<p>罗杰的脸变红了。“请你别告诉他们！”</p>
<p>'Mr Clarkson lost his job last month．He has no money．But he has an expensive house and an expensive car．He likes expensive things．'</p>
<p>“克拉克森先生上个月失业了，他没有钱了。可他有一所昂贵的房子和一辆车。他喜欢昂贵的东西。”</p>
<p>His sisters looked at him，but Roger put his hand over his eyes．'Don't talk to me！'</p>
<p>他的姐妹看着他，可罗杰用手捂住眼睛。“别对我说这些！”</p>
<p>'It doesn't matter now！'Diane said．'Mother is dead and we have a lot of money．You don't need a job．'</p>
<p>“现在没关系！”黛安娜说。“妈妈死了，我们有很多钱，你不需要一份工作。”</p>
<p>Roger's face went red again．'Be quiet，Diane！'</p>
<p>罗杰的脸又变红了。“住嘴，黛安娜！”</p>
<p>'Now，Inspector Walsh began again．'Peter Hobbs is a very angry young man．Mrs Clarkson was not very nice to him．He got the sleeping tablets from the shop．But did he put the tablets in the hot milk？I think not．Tom Briggs wanted half the garden for his farm．He was in the kitchen that night．Did he put sleeping tablets in the hot milk？I think not．'</p>
<p>“现在，”沃尔什探长又开始说了。“彼特&middot;霍布斯是个非常忿怒的年轻人，克拉克森太太对他不太好。他从商店里买到安眠药，可他会把安眠药放在热牛奶里吗？我认为不会。汤姆&middot;布里格斯想要半个花园当他的农常他那晚在厨房，是他放安眠药在热牛奶里了吗？我认为没有。”</p>
<p>Suddenly it began to rain．For a minute everyone watched it through the window．Jackie took a cigarette from her bag and began to smoke．</p>
<p>突然天开始下雨了。好一会儿大家都看着窗外的雨。杰基从包里拿了枝烟，开始抽。</p>
<p>'But someone wanted Peter Hobbs to come into the kitchen that night．She wanted everyone to see him，and listen to him，'Inspector Walsh said．</p>
<p>“可有人要彼特&middot;霍布斯那晚会厨房。她想要大家都看见他，并听他说话，”沃尔什探长说。</p>
<p>'She…？I don't understand，'Roger began，and stopped．</p>
<p>“她……？我不明白，”罗杰说着，然后又停住了。</p>
<p>Inspector walsh moved away from the window and sat down．'I'm going to tell you the true story now．Miss Clark-son，you wanted Peter Hobbs to come to the house that night．He was very angry with your mother because of that letter．He said：“I want to kill her．”And you wanted everyone to hear that． Why？'</p>
<p>沃尔什探长从窗边走过来坐下。“现在我将告诉你们事件的真象。克拉克森小姐，你那晚要彼特&middot;霍布斯来家里。他因为那封信很生你母亲的气。他说：'我要杀了她。'因而你想要大家都听到这话。为什么？”</p>
<p>Jackie's face went white．It's not true！What about Diane？You found the empty bottle in her bag！'</p>
<p>杰基的脸变白了。“这不是真的！黛安娜呢？你们在她包里发现了空瓶子！”</p>
<p>Diane stood up．'In my bag？Jackie！What are you talking about？'</p>
<p>黛安娜站起来。“在我包里？杰基！你在说什么？”</p>
<p>'Be quiet，please，and sit down，'Inspector Walsh said．He looked at Jackie．'It's true：we found the bottle in Diane's bag．But how do you know that？We didn't tell you．'</p>
<p>“请安静，坐下，”沃尔什探长说，看着杰基。“没错，我们在黛安娜的包里发现了瓶子。可你怎么知道的？我们并没有告诉你。”</p>
<p>'You did…before…you told me before！'</p>
<p>“你们告诉了……先前……你们先前告诉了我！”</p>
<p>'No．We found the empty bottle in Diane's room．We told you that．You talked about Diane's bag；we didn't tell you．Sergeant foster wrote it all down．'Inspector Walsh looked carefully at Jackie．'A long time ago，you knew Tom Briggs．He was the gardener here and you loved him．But your mother didn't like him．'</p>
<p>“没有。我们在黛安娜的房间发现了空瓶，我们告诉了你这事。你说的是黛安娜的包，我们没有告诉你。福斯特警官记下来了。”沃尔什探长仔细看着杰基。“很久以前，你认识了汤姆&middot;布里格斯，他是这儿的园丁，你爱上了他，可你的母亲不喜欢他。”</p>
<p>Jackie put her hands to her head．'No！No！'</p>
<p>杰基把手放在头上。“不！不！”</p>
<p>'We found your picture-an old one-in Mr Briggs'house．You were younger then，and your hair was long．Last year Tom Briggs came back，and you wanted him．He loved you，too，but he had no money．He wanted the garden for his farm，he wanted money，he wanted you．But your mother said no．In the end，you wanted to kill your mother…and you did kill her．Your mother went downstairs to see the dogs and you put the sleeping tablets in her hot milk．Later，you put the empty bottle in Diane's bag．</p>
<p>“我发现你的相片——一张旧的——在布里格斯家里。你比现在年青，头发长长的。去年汤姆&middot;布里格斯回来了，你想得到他，他也爱你，可他没有钱。他想要花园当他的农场，他想要钱，他也想得到你。可你母亲不同意。最后，你想杀了你母亲……然后你真的杀了她。你母亲下楼去看狗，然后你把安眠药放在她的热牛奶里。随后，你把空瓶子放进黛安娜的包里。”</p>
<p>Jackie stood up．Her eyes were dark and afraid．'You don't understand！she cried．'Mother gave me nothing…all those years．I wanted to be happy…to be with Tom．That's all．I love Tom，and he loves me．But Mother said no．Always no．'Then she began to cry．Nobody looked at her．</p>
<p>杰基站起来，她黑黑的眼睛带着恐惧。“你们不知道！”她大声道。“母亲什么也没给我……这么多年了。我想要幸福……和汤姆一起，就这些。我爱汤姆，他也爱我。可母亲不同意，总是不同意。”然后她开始哭，没人理睬她。</p>
<p>Jackie left the house in a police car．Inspector Walsh watched and then walked slowly to his car．He felt tired and hungry．He stopped and looked back at the house．</p>
<p>杰基走出房子上了警车。沃尔什探长注视着她，然后慢慢走向他的车。他觉得又累又饿。他停下来回头看着那所房子。</p>
<p>'Well，'he said to Sergeant Foster，'in the end，they go the money：Albert，Roger，Diane．They're all rich now．But are they going to be happy？'</p>
<p>“好了，”他对福斯特警官说，“最后，他们得到了钱：艾伯特，罗杰，黛安娜。他们现在都富有了。可他们会快乐吗？”</p>
<p>He got into the car．'Let's go，'he said．'I'm hungry；need a sandwich．'</p>
<p>他上了小车。“咱们走吧，”他说。“我饿了，我需要块三明治。”</p></body></html>
